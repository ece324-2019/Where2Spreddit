[UPDATE]: My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"First of all thank you so much for all the replies, I didnt think this would get so big. I have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that I write like a man, whatever that means XD)

Also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200B;

I went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. Thanks everyone :)",relationship_advice
"[update] my [32M] best friend [30 F] asked if I would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, I am in love with her but sje has no idea.","I appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",relationship_advice
"Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","Update 3:

Hey guys, and update has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). Please don't message me so angrily any more.

Update 2:

Sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

Nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

My sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.

I promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.

Thank you again to everyone.

Update:

Sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

Managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(

The good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

Thank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

My grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

"HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.","ORIGINAL POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Dear \[Wife's name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I'm ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her ""I love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. I honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, I didn't care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words ""I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

EDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",relationship_advice
[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

>Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

>Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

>Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. None of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. I'm holding off on saying anything until I'm calm and rational and won't do something I'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, I feel awful about it. ",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] My grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (F24) to marry him (26). I don't know what to do, since I don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).","Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

Well I think it's working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived.

"Update : Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""","It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",relationship_advice
My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

What the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking.",relationship_advice
I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

Me [52M] just found out at least 4 of my 5 children [33F][30F][28M][24F][14F] are not mine. Wife [51F] wont say anything.,"***Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

[31M] Husband cheated on [27F] me with his fit and skinny gym friend,"I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.",relationship_advice
Update: My sister (F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (F46) is pressuring me to,"Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket ""

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"Yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter.","Wife and I have been together since high school. Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

My wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

According to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

And when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

I really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now? I just don't know what to do. Just here for some advice. I'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?","Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here's how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He's definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Edit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people 😅",relationship_advice
HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.",relationship_advice

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here's what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There's her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she's cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,"[**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"UPDATE: My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends.

#That ""Half Blurred Nude"" everyone's talking about is Rick Astley. Please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**

**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",relationship_advice

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It's been a very hard couple of days and I've been grieving, as has my family. 

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.",relationship_advice
My (20F) boyfriend (21M) wouldn't pay for my meal when I forgot my wallet,"Basically the title. 

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don't really care like in the past, I've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we'd go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it's whatever. I figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn't really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

How messed up is that? Like why is he so cheap. A random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27M) phone.,"It's been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I'm still trying to work through all of your PM's because I'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don't. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don't know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he'd admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend's phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn't seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I've never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn't know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said ""That isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who I am"" and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don't recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but I don't really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn't sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don't know how long I stared at my TV screen that said ""Are you still watching: Planet Earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn't know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn't capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn't sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I've been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I'll continue working on replying to your PM's, but in the meantime I think I'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

"Wife told me she wanted to experiment, I obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.","Throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. My (28m) wife (26f) and I have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. We had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. However, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". She has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. My wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". At first I thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. I had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days I obliged.

That next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. Additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. We were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. However, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. I was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but I agreed.

This is when things took an extreme turn. During this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. I had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""I want your shit"". I pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""I want you to shit on me"". I pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. I felt like a fucking dick because she thought I was kinkshaming her. In a way, I was because I thought the request was far too extreme. I ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

After that incident, my wife and I hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. At the end of the week, I asked my wife to talk about what happened. She told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. I thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. I couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

We fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, I tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. I told her that I will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. She was so happy and even though I was still completely nauseated by this desire, I wanted to satisfy her.

That brings us to tonight. We were having sex for the first time this week when I (regrettably) confessed to her that I had to take a shit. She perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. I still really didn't want to go through with it, but since I had promised her I pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

She got into the bathtub and I hung my ass over the side of the tub. I started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. I turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. With enough time, I was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. I could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. However, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, I felt a sensation around my asshole.

I turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. I was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. Seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

As I clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and I heard it land somewhere beneath me. I was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so I ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. As I was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how I will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, I heard footsteps approaching. My wife lightly knocked on the door. I didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more I thought about what just happened. She walked away and then I got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

I've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. We have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but I don't think I can look at her after what she did to me. I feel deceived and violated by the woman I love and trust. During our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. She knew how uncomfortable I was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

I would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. I'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, I cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and I. I know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: I didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. I have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  I appreciate all the serious feedback and I will update tonight.",relationship_advice
I think I got reverse catfished last night,"I matched with this girl on Tinder. She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I'd give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That's very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don't know.

So I explain to her that I'm actually waiting for someone and I don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one I'm waiting for. She told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here's the thing, I don't know how I feel about being ""tested"". I don't want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I'm not sure how I should proceed.

Edit: I didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard ""I just walked in on my fiancé and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?""",relationship_advice

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",relationship_advice
My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"Hi, everyone. This will probably be lengthy as I have nobody in my life to talk to about this. This is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

My wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. We have been together for 11 years and married for 8. She has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. She previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. Well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. Following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. Ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. We also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

The following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""Standard Operating Procedures"" of our household:

&#x200B;

* If I touch a light switch I need to wash my hands
* If I touch a door knob I need to wash my hands
* If I go to the garage I need to take a shower before I      can sit down or do anything
* If I touch her pajamas or I touch towels then I need to      take a shower
* If I *even enter* the guest bathroom then I have      to take a shower
* If my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* I am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* She stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much TP as a regular person would).      The cleaning process is 3 Chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. I have to immediately shower after this.
* If she spills excess *water* on the floor then I      have to mop it and anywhere I walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where I walked after stepping in the water.
* She goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. Every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. She washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. If she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. If,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      If her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. She discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. She uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" As you can see, this adds up      and I end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. This doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* If I change out laundry and **I graze the doorframe** when I enter the bedroom with clothes, I have to discard ALL OF THEM.
* If an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* If I even *touch* the dishwasher I have to wash my      hands.
* If she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will NOT      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. This means if she is hungry or thirsty I will bring it to her.
* Her showers last around 40 minutes. She bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. Our water bill is ridiculous.
* If my son (2 YO) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. This includes      naps. If I take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. Not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* When I clean the house (which I dont mind, btw.      Cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. No deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200B;

1. Change out laundry and leave washer free
2. Wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. Sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. Pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. Sanitize all counters
6. Clean kids bathroom
7. Take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. Take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. Take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. Clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. Take shower
12. Put bathroom rugs in washer
13. Take shower
14. Sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. Mop house in very specific order
16. Take shower

I want to make this clear - I have no problem with cleaning but I often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and I get berated. My wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. Often, I have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so I will be doing it after midnight. Of course I will make mistakes when I am mentally exhausted.

&#x200B;

* If I bring her water, I have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. She thinks that      if I hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. I do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* If I have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. She thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. This is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* If my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. He gets out often because she wont close the door.
* My wife **will not touch doorknobs**. She uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* If I leave the house with my phone, I cannot bring it      back into the house until I sanitize it. That includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* No shoes on the in house, ever. I had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. I had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop TWICE where they walked.
* Her depth perception is abysmal. We get in so many      fights because she thinks that I touched her with a dirty object when I      was *halfway across the room.* When she gets dressed, I half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. Same with pants.
* We never have people over because of her fear of      infection. Plus, I am the one who has to clean and sanitize so I am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

There is more things I have to deal with but I cannot remember every situation right now. The worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). I have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. I wash my hands over 50 times a day. I have gotten to the point where I just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. I fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. I get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. And this is not because of my kids.

You may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" We did that about two months ago. My dad may be the only person who really knows what I am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. That is exactly what I did. I told the counselor everything that I just revealed to all of you. I have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" The counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. My wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. After the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

I want to say one last thing. Before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. We loved each other and felt we were meant to be. I still love her and want it to work. I have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. I am physically and mentally exhausted. I have thought of leaving multiple times but I am afraid of how it will affect my kids. We also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. My wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (I dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

Has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? Thank you for taking the time to read and I appreciate any and all advice.

**TL;DR** \- My wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

EDIT:  I want to make something clear.  My children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  They dont do what I do - that is the one thing I absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  But yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  I talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how I feel - again.  She broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  When I get home we will continue to address this.  ",relationship_advice
I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"[Update Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200B;

Groom and I had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. I'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because I've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. In fact, since knowing him, I've talked him through each of his break ups. We've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, I helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. I'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. I've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

A month after his engagement, Groomsman Invitational Boxes went out. We have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. Of the original high school group, I was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. This obviously stung, but I maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. It triggered my depression for a solid month where I questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the Groom and I had a talk.

He said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which I'm sure it was. He told me that I was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the Bride would not sign off on my involvement. Apparently, I had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. She'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). I'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. He said it was tearing him up inside, and I believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. He said that he'd let her know that I knew about how she felt towards me and that I'd be reaching out to talk about it. So I messaged the Bride through text and DM, saying (paraphrased), ""Hey! I'm so sorry if anything I've said has upset you. Can we meet sometime and talk? I'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" The Bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final Groomsmen Invitation Box goes out to another friend.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the Bride, Groom, and I are hanging out. Groom and I are talking, and I'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so I ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. The conversation leads us here...

Groom: Hey man, I wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

Me: Sure. What's up?

Groom: I was wondering if you would want to usher for me? It's no big deal if you can't, but I want you to be there for me if you can, you know? Like, be a part of the wedding.""

Me (very touched): Yeah! Of course I can, dude. Anything for you two.

Groom: Thank you so much. You know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. I know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

Me: I'll have to see if I can leave work early, but I'm already there, man. Thanks for thinking of me!

A week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so I shoot him a text saying, ""Hey man! Big day's this weekend. Just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. I got the time off with my boss, so I can definitely make it. Just let me know."" He returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""Yeah man, we would still like you to usher. I'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. Thanks for helping us out!"" I'm a little put out, but I persevere. At least he asked me to be an usher. That's something, right?

Morning of the wedding comes around and I'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time I should show up to the reception to start helping. Then Bride messages me asking for a favor. These messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages I had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. Bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. Can I do this for a bride, on her wedding day? Sure. Oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **Sure.**

At this point I should have stopped and asked myself, ""Why am I helping so much? Why didn't I ask for their money up front? Should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" Hindsight. 20/20. With the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while I go pick up the appetizers. Thank God I played as much Tetris as I have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. I text the Bride to let her know we've got everything together and I'd see them at the reception. Once again, left on read.

I get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. I find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. The venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. So I have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

Since guests were already seating themselves, I immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. It was a fucking mess. At one point, I was so down about the situation that I literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" To start, the place cards were in no discernible order. They were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. I should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. We weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. The best part is, I say ""we"" because at this point I met my ushering-peers; they were the Grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (I'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. When I asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. We did this at the wedding last year.""

After finding out that, to the Groom, I was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. They ask me to stay for a drink, but I can't because I'm still ushering. As I step back behind the name card table, I take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. To my right, I see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. I look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and I wonder, how did I get here?

Wedding kicks off & in the rare instance I can speak to Bride & Groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. I also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should I do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  I'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when I walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. I can understand this. Maybe they're burned out. Maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

Now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the Groom approaches me.

Groom: Hey, thanks again for your help. I was wondering if I could borrow you again?

Me: What's up?

Groom: Did you drive here? We have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

Me: ... how far is the hotel?

Groom: 10 minutes away.

Me (for a Groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... Sure.

Get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, I'm hungry. Groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. He goes to get changed, I say I'm gonna grab food & come back. Groom asks for food for he & Bride. I say sure. Bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. Sure. Then she asks the room at large who'd like food. Now I'm buying food for almost the whole after party. Cousin says she'll venmo me when I get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **Sure.**

Come back, cousin is passed out. Drunken guests grab whatever food they see. Groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. I grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. At this point, I'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that I never really had a best friend to begin with. I feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. I went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. This was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how I thought it would. I've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and I'm left wondering how I could have been such a chump, and how many other times I'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

The advice I'm hoping for is, how can I go about expressing how terrible a time I had at his wedding without insulting him, if I should do that at all, how can I develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? Also, I feel like the missing puzzle piece is the Bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what I did to her. I know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. How can I start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? Should I just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200B;

tl;dr ""Best Friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It's a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". It's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. Second I've know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn't time stamped so I don't have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we're past that. But apparently this person or persons isn't.

The whole thing is strange. I'm not sure what's going on. I haven't told my wife, I'm not sure how she would take it. She's very sexual and adventurous but I don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don't think I'll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I'm overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn't seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she'd rather I didn't have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I'm just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn't give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn't say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. And for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I'll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife's Facebook account - childish and immature I'll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I'm questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It's time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I (28M) think my girlfriend (26F) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.,"Link to previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=JQRWKQ4D&sh=e1753ed8)

I finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. A lot of things that I never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

As soon as she opened the door to our apartment, I could tell that she was already starting to cry. Seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because I didn't want to put her in that position. 

I had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

We sat down, there were lots of tears. I thought I would be bitter, angry and that I would be screaming at her the whole time but I felt disappointed instead. 

I told her that I saw the messages and explained how I ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

She kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

Then I told her that WE go more way back than they ever did. I was there through her lowest point, I helped her get up.

She admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

I saw it coming, I had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. At that point, I was full on crying. I can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. It still is now. 

I remember telling her that I was done, that whatever we had was over. She kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, I don't think I ever will. I can't tolerate people who cheat.

By that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

Obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

When I posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. His place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. He'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that I can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

We both agreed that I don't mention him in this post. I'm glad that I really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. Thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

It's almost 3am, I'm heartbroken as ever but I'm trying my best. I'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. Every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. I'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

To all my Aussie mates,  if you live near/around Chapel Hill, let me know! 

America, you were great but now it's time to come home. Thanks for the help everyone.

EDIT: I'm crying again, not because I got cheated on but because I realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. I almost can't believe I looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. I am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

Anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

I may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but I gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

Other than that, I am feeling better. It still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? She made her choice so I made mine. 

I woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that I shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

It sucks that I may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. I thanked them and said that although I believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

Ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so I junked it straight away. 

I miss her like crazy. I know it will take a lot of time to heal me but I guess I can wait. 

ps. I'll message my newfound Aussie friends when I go through all the comments. Exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but I'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

My (19F) boyfriend (20M) broke up with me because I'm too good at sex,"We've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. We took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. And after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

Even after our first time, he asked me if I really was a virgin or if I lied because I was too good. No I didn't lie. I just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. Since then, he'd get weird during sex. Like if I did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. Now I know he was questioning if I really was a virgin. 

Anyway. He broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. TMI I was riding him and he said I act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy I've been with and he thinks I lied to him. I told him I watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

Great. Never thought I'd be dumped for being too good at sex. It just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. I want him back. I know he's just being paranoid. How do I tell him that I wasn't lying?

Okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",relationship_advice
"Overheard my [26M] fiancé [24F] tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort.""","

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should ""sit down and talk."" She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me ""I already know what this is about."" My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said ""I was just joking, I wasn't serious."" She then went on saying stuff like ""I love you, I love you."" I told her I can't be in a marriage where my S/O doesn't love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she ""didn't want to lose me."" I told her I don't think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I've never been so happy with a decision I've made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""Fuck you."" She started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, ""You're the fucking worst relationship I've ever been in. You think I can't find someone again?"" ""Do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? You're a fucking idiot [my name]."" She grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""I'm leaving!"" Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I'm still crying as I type this up. It's both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (I'm not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. I've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. I'm going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can't change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, ""Sweetie, remember it's your choice. Don't settle for just anyone. That's the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven't said anything about it since. I honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,"Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


EDIT:  I'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from Reddit. Thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. Really, really.
I promise I will post an update!

My(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. I need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.,"I'm actually an immigrant from Mexico, so my English is average at best. 

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this. I'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. I love both of them very much and I'd like to help diffuse this situation.

Update: My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I'm Jewish...,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn't turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I'm Jewish. She didn't believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn't say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I've never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn't know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

"My (18F) best friend (18F) cheated on her boyfriend (21M), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. Should I tell him?","Ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. Also I know this is pretty fucked up but Natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

We graduated high school this summer so our friends and I all went on a small vacation to Italy. We found a Groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. Natalie is dating Eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. It was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. It's pretty well known among us friends that Dylan who is in our high school, likes Natalie. He's like really into her. Well when we all went to Europe, since Eric wasn't there, Natalie was all over Dylan. Acting like a couple, being all flirty. They'd SLEEP in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. Well, I shared a room with Natalie and I walked in on them having sex. Afterwards I asked her what she was doing since she was dating Eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. It was not. We were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. Dylan's dreams came true that week. But only I knew about it since it was our room. Everyone else had their suspicions but I was the only one who really knew the truth. 

When we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on Eric again. She kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. So I promised to keep her little fling a secret. Fucked up I know but I have more loyalty to Natalie than Eric. 

She continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and I asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if I slapped her across the face. She said it's obviously Eric and I reminded her about Dylan and she insisted that Eric is the father and to never mention Dylan in front of her again. She's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told Eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. She told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. He wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

Y'all. Dylan is obviously the father. Like 100%. They were fucking like rabbits in Italy and I don't think she knew how to say ""where can I buy condoms"" in Italian. I feel bad for Eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

I love Natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like I feel really bad for Eric. I know she's scared and Eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. Dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. Eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. But it's not fair for him. I know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

I don't know like if I tell Eric, Natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",relationship_advice
My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?,"Two nights ago, my fiancée accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad.

Short update because I'm supposed to be working. And I don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but I don't know who else to tell. 

The day after I posted originally, I told her I'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". It went well. Really well, so easily and just good. And she slept next to me again that night.. I got to kiss her in public! She said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

I'm distraught.  I don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.

She's REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn't know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  I had to do it.  I told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don't know how to cope with this.  I can't eat.  I can't sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and I'm just disgusted.  I'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

"UPDATE: I (21M) got my FWB (33F) pregnant and she's keeping it, I want to talk to her about other options.","This is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

Well some time has passed.. And a lot has happened. My first post had a lot of comments and I got some PM's from people asking me what went down so that's why I'm updating.

So I didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because I realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. I didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and I shouldn't have done that. But I needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever I was going to decide would change my life so I needed some space, though I could have communicated a bit more (which I'm working on now).

Anyways, I realized that I'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. I was stuck on the age gap, I kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when I thought of her. Some comments really stuck with me and I decided to just trust my feelings. I ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. She was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how I felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. I'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. She completely lit up when I told her, I saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. She was ecstatic, I won't ever forget that. 

Every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. I really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. We talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and I don't understand how it has all been so amazing. I know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. I moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, I had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. She has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. They got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. On top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl I've introduced them to. The pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. I'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, I'm really close with my parents. They are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. They fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

She's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. I've been trying to help her and support her any way I can, and did a TON of reading online to understand what's going on. I offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that I can keep going. We need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

So yeah... I'm going to a dad. She's gonna give birth to our kid.. Still feels surreal to me, but I'm low-key kinda excited. It'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. I'm happy that I'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

"Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""","This is all over the place. I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby,"Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I don't know what to say to her.,"Hey everyone. I don't know what to do in this situation because I never expected I'd face something like this. I'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but I'm coming up seriously short here.

I met my wife on Tinder at the end of 2015. We talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. By the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. We were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. More than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

I know, heavy topics for a first date. We were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

At the very least I held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. Her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. She immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

We dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. After getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

Four nights ago was the first time I ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. My wife was out with a friend, and I was doing some house cleaning. I was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so I took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. At the bottom I saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case B were visible. I immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

I had known that my wife was on her period because when I tried to initiate sex, she told me so. I found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and I made comment about the timing being odd. She told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. I figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

I haven't told her that I found the box. When she got home that night everything was so normal. I tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

The more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. What if she was assaulted? What if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? What if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? Or, what if she just cheated? I only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of Plan B and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

I don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. We have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. I've done nothing to displease her, at least that I know of. Maybe I'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than I'm giving it credit for. But I feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because I don't know how.

My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",relationship_advice
[Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded ""WE NEED TO TALK"" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like ""welp, I'm dead.""

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",relationship_advice
I [26M] upset a woman [20sF] and my friends are acting like I'm in the wrong.,"Hey guys.

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time. 

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

TL;DR: My friends are acting like I was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",relationship_advice
Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met,"This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""Maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""Joe"" and his wife ""Kate."" After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",relationship_advice
Girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs,"My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20's and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I [24F] am dating a [25M] almost unreasonably picky eater and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This happened last night.

&#x200B;

This update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than I had hoped but it is what it is. I read what you all wrote and I appreciate all the comments left for me. Despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that I'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

I decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. He needed help and so long as I saw that he was trying that was all I asked for. We were out to dinner (I'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to Germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" I was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but I figured now was as good a time as any: 

Me: Maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. Maybe you can just try new German cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. Have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

J: No way. I have people depending on me to continue this streak. I don't want to let them down.

Me: I don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, I'm worried about you. This is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. You're about to go on this incredible trip to Germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. I think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

We had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. He doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how I was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. I let him know how this IS my business because it affects me. We can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

We let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. The plan after was to go back to his place where I would spend the night. The entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while I wished I had just gone home. I should have gone home. I guess I didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when I got to his place.

He flipped.

He began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how I couldn't control what he did or ate. I told him I cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. I ultimately agreed that he was right, I couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that I stick around and watch and enable him like I had been doing in the past. 

It escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when I was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. I could not and still cannot dispute that. He was. I guess the only difference between him and I is that I wanted to change. I acknowledged the issue and knew I could not go on like this any longer. Obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. One spirals much faster than the other so I was able to recognize it much quicker. 

I told him I was going to leave because I couldn't deal with this anymore. We kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. He has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. He would be sharing it on facebook. I completely panicked. I cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. He told me if I walked out he absolutely would. 

That was all I needed to hear. He was going to blackmail me. I think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. If I leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

So I left. I don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all I care. He emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

Let him post it. Fuck it. I can't control other people I can only control myself and how I react. I deactivated all my social media and I'm ready to move on with my life. It hurts that somebody I trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. Thank you all for reading.

My(23F) boyfriend(25F) left me on the side of the road and I deserved it.,"My amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like ""Haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""C'mon, please? I want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say ""Well, that could've gone a lot worse."" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like ""Wtf"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",relationship_advice
I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.",relationship_advice
Engagement ring/breakup fund,"[update] Thank you all!! I appreciate the traction this silly post gained. Your responses have more that assured me that I've got something here. I got back from my parent's 25th anniversary party my sisters and I put on today and the post blew up. I hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents! 

I did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. Have an amazing day everyone!

Whenever I start a new relationship I start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. I'm a big romantic so I intend on using this money, in the event this girl is ""the one"", towards an engagement ring far down the road. Subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, I cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. Is this idea brilliant or am I putting too much attention on these extremes?",relationship_advice
UPDATE I've been putting off introducing my [28M] girlfriend [26F] to my parents [60sM/F] because they'll be weird about her weight,"[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course. 


Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We're moving in together so I'm thinking I'll bring her out. 


Mom: Oh that's nice. First week of December maybe? 


Me: Sure. Look there's one thing though. She's not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. 


Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


Me: No. This is exactly what I'm talking about. 


Mom: Fine. I'm just happy I finally get to meet her. 


Dad: *Insulting weight related comment*


Me: What the fuck dad? 


Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


Me: No if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, I'll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


Dad: *Insulting joke* 



Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



Mom: No, wait, I'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


Dad: *Insulting comment* 



Me: I'm hanging up. 


So it looks like I'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it's a non issue it turns out.

I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.,"Is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time. 

Long story short, i'm half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad's side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don't care how i'm treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should I sit?"". I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn't stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. I said  ""for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I've never seen you treat her with the same"".  She didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more. 

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else? 


[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom's reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She's always taken the high road it's a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It's taught me a valuable skill in life. I don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn't say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish. 

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can't describe it). There wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can't believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""F*ck her"".  Please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don't regret it.. Grandma's 80th Bday is in two months.  I can't wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

[Update 12/29/18]
I wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how I felt and I didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. I explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. I told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. I told her I wished I had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. I told her I want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. I'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

I called my grandma to let her know I sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. I told her I didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. My grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. I was right for standing up for my mom. Also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""I never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I've been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?

UPDATE: My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"EDIT:  [Here is the original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200B;

Its been awhile since my original post, but I didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

Since then, not much has improved. I decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. To my surprise, she agreed and I was so happy.

Unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  I had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I feel so broken right now.  I'm going to see a counselor in hopes that I can figure out what to do.

I dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but I pray that she takes advantage of it because I still love her and I did this because I still do.

I told myself I would stop enabling her, mainly because I just cannot sustain this life. I am physically and mentally exhausted.  My kids are my top priority but I cant take care of them if I dont first take care of myself.

I thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. She was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and I hope that it will help her.

Thanks for reading.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.,"Link to original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m\_recently\_found\_out\_that\_my\_older\_sister34f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bw8dsa/i19m_recently_found_out_that_my_older_sister34f/)

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an ""It's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. Thanks Reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",relationship_advice
[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews.

I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?,"I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same.",relationship_advice
[Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, ""I'll remember to respect from now on."" That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice.",relationship_advice
"This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?","So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

"[Serious] My (35M) girlfriend (24F) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and I'm not into it at all.","So, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. An additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. I've never thought much of it, I thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. But she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that I'm not entirely comfortable with. A few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first I was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. I laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. I said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said I'd do it the following day. Honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. I told her no, and I didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. Am I being a dick here? I don't know what to do.

"Me (M34) and fiancee (F27), I am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.","Alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as I'm doing it. As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice

My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.",relationship_advice
I(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when I was told to look after the family pet.,"My siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and I've been of to uni. 

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be ""free"". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: 



I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




Edit 30 juli: 

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",relationship_advice

I (29 F) am letting my baby be adopted so I can give him a better more stable life with two parents. After he is born I will be going to a mental health facility to try to get myself better.

UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"&#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!"" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now. ",relationship_advice
My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where I proposed.,"I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It's really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. So she can't possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place I asked. 

I'm preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but I'm done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
My (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if I don't be her surrogate she'll cut me out of her life forever.,"My mother and her new husband want to have a baby. She's still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. So her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she's older. She told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can't do that. For one, I'm trying to get my nursing degree and I don't want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way I want to go through it again so soon. I'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. I don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn't deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then I don't want a relationship with you anymore"". I asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. I don't know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I'm not sure how I should handle this. I think she's acting crazy.",relationship_advice
My (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me,"I can't stop thinking of it. I've been in the bath for a long time because I've been dreading going to bed with him. 

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him ""Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that"". And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". I couldn't say anything, I didn't know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don't even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive?

"My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.","FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I'm feeling towards my wife. Until now I've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I'm the breadwinner I can't help but to feel like I'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. I've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""Laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn't know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn't realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I'm leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn't think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife's harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don't know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?",relationship_advice

My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.,"I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her. 

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than Grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be.",relationship_advice
The way I (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. How do i tell people when they ask,"So I met my boyfriend a year ago. I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",relationship_advice
"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. [NSFW]","[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",relationship_advice
Update: My[M25] girlfriend[24] of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommate[M25]. I just heard them through the wall.,"It's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships.

> As the title says, we broke up. It was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. We broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. Admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so I can see why it happened.
> 
> This isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any PDA while I'm around. I still both consider them friends and I just want them to be happy.

> For the most part, they are quiet at night. If I really listen I can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. Except for last night. We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.

> TL;DR: My ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date. 

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

TL;DR: I moved out and started dating a new girl. ",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.",relationship_advice

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M),"Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it's good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about ""Danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""Dr. Soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""Danny"".  (I don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know Jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

I think I'm going to confront them in the session this Thursday.",relationship_advice
UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion,"Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have ""ThrowRA"". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**ORIGINAL** 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**UPDATE**

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for commenting. I expected maybe a dozen comments and I've got hundreds of PM's. Thank you all so much for your help. I'm not sure what the rules of updating are, but if it's possible I'll update as soon as I can.",relationship_advice
Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?**

**Edit:**  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

My [25M] girlfriend[29] suggested about having a FFM threesome. I was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. Now she is giving me a hard time because I accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. Am I being manipulated?,"Hello all,
A few days ago my[25M] girlfriend[29] suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

Knowing her, I disagreed at first. She kept on insisting and I gave into the idea. I cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
A few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. Then when I finally reached her she was crying. She seemed broken. She told me that I didn't deny her strong enough. She told me that had I ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. She was mad and we broke up because I didn't deny her strongly.
Basically, I feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
I feel that I am being manipulated. Dear reddit, please help me out. Thanks.

UPDATE (2 weeks after the post): First off, Thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. The comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. Thanks a lot.

We had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. So, I decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. No clue about her intentions though, but I am at a much better place. Thank you reddit!",relationship_advice
Update: She[20f] lost her virginity while we were taking a break,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

Hey guys. First of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

So, long story short, 3 days ago I ""broke up"" with her for good.

Now, you guys might not agree with the way I did it, but I did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. Even though I am sad and disappointed, at the same time I understand she wanted to see other options and I respect she didn't outright cheat on me. That being said, I am also not a backup plan and I deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

I didn't see her anymore and I finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""Hey \[name\], first of all, I don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. I took some days to think about it and I realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and I would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. I understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. Sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. I respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. I wanted to thank you for all those years and I wanted to apologize for any wrongs I did to you. I want you to know that I am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. I hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. Goodbye, op""

The message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but I realized I am already getting over it and that I no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. She replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. So, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, I am almost certain that I would accept her back. So yeah, until next time.",relationship_advice
My [45M] Wife [42F] revealed she was unfaithful and I'm divorcing her. Our children [15F & 17M] hate me for it.,"Edit: Guys, I appreciate the advice. But I'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. I've made my decision, and it's not something I'm willing to forgive. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

Tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. I'm leaving. Kids hate me for it.",relationship_advice
[Update] Dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. Am I wrong to be angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that doesn't mean I need to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.

Edit: I'm not going to ghost or abandon them. They need to become independent now. 

Edit:  I'm reading all the comments. I know I have acted like a jerk. I just need some time to collect my thoughts. I might update later.",relationship_advice
"[FINAL UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. I haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. There's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

My family agrees with a lot of you. They're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. Just give me some time. I'm not going to make another update post, because I've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe I'll just update this post in a few days after I've decided what to do.",relationship_advice
I was forced into sex work from 12-14. People at school know because the people who forced me into it were arrested and I went into foster care.

[SERIOUS] I (26m) can't handle being a single parent. Should I give my daughter (3f) up for adoption?,"My girlfriend passed away two years ago unexpectedly. It was all far to quick for me to process. We were both estranged from our parents. It was hard work raising our child together but we were happy. I just can't cope anymore. I'm finding it too difficult to raise a child on my own. I work all day with two different jobs, most of that going on childcare. I spend maybe a few hours a day with her before I put her to bed. I'm ashamed to say, I don't know if I want her. I love her but I just can't handle all this pressure on my own.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, I would love to hear what you have to say.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments and replies. I am so grateful for all the support. The advice you have provided is amazing.


> It really looks like OP is only considering this for financial reasons.

I'm in debt because of I can't afford to provide the basic necessities for my daughter. I live off paychecks and take cash in hand jobs. I skip meals. I don't regret any of it. I would take a bullet for her. This is a really hurtful comment. I just want her to have a better childhood than I did.

I want to clarify this. I don't know if I will be a good dad. I'm not the model dad. No real education and a criminal record to my name.

"My ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), I was starting to heal until I found out the reasons why he ghosted.","The past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

My ex, 'Tom', and I had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so I thought. We had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). I was happy, and I thought he was too. We had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, I could go on. 

Everything was fine until our last trip together. We went to a destination where I had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something I'd have to wait longer to do. It was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. Once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

After we landed (the last time I saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. I didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. I tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. I started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. From there our communication basically broke down. I can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. From that point I'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. After about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then I wouldn't hear from him for several more days. What hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with New Years, Valentine's Day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

I felt like I was going crazy. I had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  I was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. I stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. I found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse I could think of whenever I showed up somewhere without him. 

I eventually broke down, I contacted one of his good friends who I felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. I told her that Tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and I have no idea what's going on. I told her I didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that I needed to know about. She looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that Tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and I that I was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. This was soul crushing to hear and I felt humiliated and worthless. I told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. She said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

Throughout March and April I felt like I was starting to heal some. I felt broken, but I started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. I told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. Then I found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

He had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. Not sure how long, but a little less than a year. I'm also hurt because I know the person he cheated on me with. She's an absolute garbage person. And I'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. She has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. I've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the LGBT community and non-Christians. She is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. She somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. I think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, I'm really not sure. I can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. I've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. Not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. Her parents have paid for her car and I think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. She spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and I frequent and will interject herself into our outings. She has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

Tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew I wouldn't approve. Then he started to get high and then have sex with her. He felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. His intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. This woman hated my guts, and kept pushing Tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. He didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

Tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. So she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. He came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

I only found out about this, because the same friend I had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that Tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that I deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. There is no way in hell that I'd get back together with Tom
2. I can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that Tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and I'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. I don't know if I could contain my urge to slap him, or if I would just break down and sob. I was doing well from moving on from him. I was starting to feel happy again. Now, I think I'm back at square 1. I'm depressed and stressed out. 

Is there anything I can do? I kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",relationship_advice
My (25 F) boyfriend (24 M) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote.,"Update: Hi everyone, I had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. I'm sorry that I haven't been responding, I posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so I haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. I am still at work so I won't have time until later to read through everything.
I wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. It has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt I have been facing. He really had me questioning this entire situation and whether I was overreacting or not. I am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. I can update again afterwards.
Thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. Even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


I don't want to cause any political debates. If it's necessary for context: obviously I believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

I'm so confused, I don't know what to think. I'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but I just feel that I need some advice.

In the time I have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so I thought. Politics was never an issue between us at all. However he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are American) and that they should not be allowed to vote... He says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

I'm upset and I can't tell if I'm wrong to be upset about this because I know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now I just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. He has assured me that he still thinks that I should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

This is a person I have been with for almost 5 years. We've talked about marriage. I don't know what to think. In all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and I can't imagine my life without him in it. But this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

Am I wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? As his girlfriend am I supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though I may (strongly) disagree? I can't tell if I'm overreacting to this or not. The whole situation has made me feel terrible and I'm so confused.",relationship_advice

This hurts me to my core to think that someone I wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. Out of all the women I've ever dated she was the one I was least worried about this happening with. 
She tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, I just don't know if I can move on. 
We live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
I just don't know what to do. I still love her to pieces  but idk if I can get past this. 
Do I still go on the trip with her? Do I try and make this work? I'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

Edit: singing out for a bit guys. Need to take some time and think things through and let my emotions stabilize. Get in the right mindset. We talked when I got home and drove home some additional points you guys pointed out. Thank you all for your comments, it's nice to see another point of view.",relationship_advice
I [F25] received a letter from my mother [F49] yesterday in the mail. I've never cried harder.,"So around a week ago I posted on Reddit that I was having issues with my mother. My husband and I took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. We are now working on adopting them. She has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. So I decided to take a step back from her.

I've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. It broke my heart and I broke down in tears. Probably the most I've cried in so long.

It was such a heartbreaking letter. She said that ""I was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""Those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". It was a full page of just insults. The one that really got to me was ""You've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". I broke down that line. Throughout my life all I wanted was to make her proud.

I ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. I'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. I talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. He truly is my rock.

I truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. It broke me down but now I have to pick myself up. I fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. Does anyone have any advice? Anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",relationship_advice
I(22M) Recently discovered My Dad (50M) choose me over my former Stepmother and Half-sister(17F) 6 years ago. Don't know how to process this.,"I was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. Both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. When I was sent to live with my dad, I was broken. I barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  I wasn't mad or angry. I was null of any kind of emotion. Basically I was alive but wasn't living. I kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. I was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. I was more social with my dad but I kept it to a bare minimum.  I had noting left to say to anyone. It took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. That's how withdrawn I had become.

Dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  When I experienced night- terrors, I would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  He drove me to all of my therapist appointments. He made sure I was eating properly. There were days, I would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. He literally went above and beyond for me. I hated the city that were living in. Because  I had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

I was so passive, it was scary. My therapist had told my dad that I was stuck in the victim's cycle; I didn't know how to get out. Because of this, I was bullied quite a bit. By the time I was 15, I had been to 3 different schools. It got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. I was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. Noting would motivate me.

Looking back, Dad did spoil me but at the time I wasn't aware of it. I was so in my own body that I barley acknowledged my surroundings.   If I asked my dad for a new bed spread, I would get me new one plus new furniture. My phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. I was grateful and thanked him. I did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. Again I was being polite. I didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. I barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

By the time I was 16, Dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. I didn't question it. He had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. I didn't think it was any of my business so I didn't press the issue. A year later, Dad had divorced my stepmother. One of Dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in Boston and he took it. We moved and I felt I was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. That year was probably the best year of my life. I was coming out of my shell. There was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. It was if I was like everyone else. I felt ""normal"". I became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, I was going out more. Us moving probably saved my life.

Because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. There was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. You could just sense it. It got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

Me and Dad have always been close. When I had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, I could see my dad crying in the crowd. I lived with my dad while I attended college ( I still do for the time being) . Ever since I was child, I always wanted to be a doctor. Well, I just finished my first year of medical school. Honestly, I feel like a normal young adult in society. I have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom I've been with for 4 years. I'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

Recently, I got FB message from my half-sister. She was apologizing a lot and I had no clue what she was talking about. Turns out, the reason why Dad and I moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what I was watching her change........... Yes. She told her mom that I was watching her change.. At the time, I was traumatized of sex. Heck I was terrified of any form of intimacy. The kid was envious of what Dad was doing for me. She was so envious that she tried to move me out. Well I guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and I'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. Because we moved out, I think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. How can someone be so cruel? What did I ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. I didn't even respond. More importantly, Dad never let this to get back to me. Chances are if I had heard about this when I was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. It also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

This is a lot to take in and I have a new found of respect and love for my dad. He gave up this marriage for me so I could live a normal life.Dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. I'm missing him a lot lately.

Should I bring it up to him when he returns? Also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? At the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and I almost want to help.

Tl;dr: Dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. Dad kept it from me for 6 years. Should I bring up with him?

Edit: I wasn't expecting such a huge response. I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. It will take some time but I will read all of them or as much as I can. As I was going through the comments, I found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. This a part of my life. I don't normally like to talk about about this . Aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. The fact the people are saying that it's fake.... I don't what to say. It's not my place to try and convince anyone. Believe  me, they're times I wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. When I wrote this, I wasn't thinking about syntax. It was more just getting this out. People questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. Forgive me but I wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

As for how I became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; I did respond to it in the comments but I'll post it here too. 

""It was very unorthodox how I became valedictorian after attending a real HS for only a year. My overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because I was in online classes for my previous hears, I wasn't eligible at the time. I met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

I broke down in front of the coordinator and I told her the truth. Being named valedictorian was something I always wanted. To be that would have been my first accomplishment that I would have achieved based on my own merit. Yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. It wasn't trying to be Valedictorian financial reasons. Money wasn't a problem (Dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. This would have helped me self-worth as well.

The girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and I told her the truth. She actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. It something I'll forever be grateful for. That's actually how me and her became friends."". Not many people would do that and in HS. 

I'll be posting again. I just need a few days.",relationship_advice
My husband constantly bodyshames me.,"I was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, I'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. He constantly comments on my body and my weight even though I've never asked for his opinion.  I know my body isn't perfect, but I'm working on accepting that. 

Actual things he has said to me

1. (A day after I gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - [*disgusted tone and expression*] ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" By the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""It's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""Your thighs are huge. When you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""It's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. It's very noticeable from behind. I'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""I'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
Who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. He even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""Who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""Who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""Who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""Why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? You keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. So maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""Short and fat isn't a good combination""

And so on. On average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. I've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. It's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",relationship_advice
Update to My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

So I've made a lot of changes in my family life since I posted this a couple weeks ago. I first told everything to my boyfriend. He was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. He also respected that I didn't want her to meet him. 

I decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?

I told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

I blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

Then, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. 

I told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. 

Then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

I ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

I don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

My boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. 

Overall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. 

TL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I think my (22M) girlfriend (20F) might be cheating on me with my roommate.,"Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

TLDR: My girlfriend was really close with my roommate, I suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

Basically, after I kicked my gf out of our party, I assumed we would all lay low for a few days. I was wrong. The day after the party, my roommate (I decided to call him Chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but I ignored him. Less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing Chet couldn't have been avoided, because while I was a good boyfriend, I study and sleep too much. Ok. She then told me she would be willing to work through this if I was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. I didn't respond to the text.

That night I had a dinner with my parents I couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. I came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. I figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. Wrong. I noticed later when Chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into HIS room.

I haven't seen either of them, I think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. I don't even know how to feel. Honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and I'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",relationship_advice
my (21F) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if I got breast augmentation surgery,"so I have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if I wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

I am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because I know they don't look normal. I just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

I mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when I tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

I 100% plan on going through with the surgery. I told my doctor up front that I did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in April, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR: I have tuberous breasts & the only way to correct it is surgery. my bf completely shot down the idea bc he doesn't want to date a girl with fake boobs.",relationship_advice
"Girlfriend (22F) mad about my (24M) answer to scenario, what do I do?","So girlfriend and I had just finished having sex. We were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, I was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" And I mean I say that all the time so I didn't think much of it and I said ""yes, I will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. She kisses me but then says "" so if I turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... I was confused because it was such a random question and I laughed and just said ""I don't know about that, I'd love you as a pet I guess""

She sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point I'm completely lost. I just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" I said ""I mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey I would still love you unconditionally and I would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... I had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. I just said "" if you were a donkey how else was I supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? Am I supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" She says ""I'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... I just stopped talking because I didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

I'm just confused. She was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. What did I say? I have no idea what exactly she was upset about. Am I not looking into this deep enough? I'm genuinely confused as to what I did and how to fix it. I don't want to say something and make it worse. ",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Edit: Previous post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)

Okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. I'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

A friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. She had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do I even really know the full story yet. She is not really the prank playing type and I guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

It looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. After I started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. Well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. I guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

Anyway, I texted her and I told her that I knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. She started blowing my phone up apologizing. She said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. She also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that I was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

I just didn't really respond to her. I left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. My family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. Our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. I'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. I'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as I'm awake with this Jameson. 

tl;dr: This was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",relationship_advice
My [F28] MIL won't take my kid's [4] anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously,"**UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF POST.**

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Sorry for mobile formatting. I've never really seen eye-to-eye with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son. I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let it go, so I've tried to. 

Until now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

Now my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly. 

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

I'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I worry too much. 

Would it be awful if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**EDIT/MINI-UPDATE**: First of all, woah. I did not expect this to get so much attention. Thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. In case you missed it: I'VE LEFT FOR NOW, removed my son from the situation, and I'm now currently staying at my brother's house. At least for a few days until things cool off and I'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. In the mean time, I've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). Unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. My husband has been to the same appointments I have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

Some people have accused me of being a helicopter Mom, or trying to demonize my MIL. And given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe I'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then I'm okay. I'm not even a SAHM, we have an incredible nanny while I work FT, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. In the past, I've tried my best for my MIL to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, I've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. But I'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

Lastly, I just want to say my MIL has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. She won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. So, I don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. She's very strong in her beliefs. I did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. My husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so I told him to find time or he won't be getting ANY time with my son until he does. If he's going to be so careless, I'll end up dealing with this legally. 

Thanks again everyone. Words can't express my gratitude. I will update with a new thread eventually.",relationship_advice
My [22f] boyfriend's [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,"Hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

I don't really know how to begin so I'm just gonna dive right in. We've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

Last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. This took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. He talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. Cool, I thought. That all sounds beautiful. 

We didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. It was on a day I was working so I couldn't go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

I did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good. It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

It's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. Colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. I can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

My only issue with it is during sex. 

It takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. It doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu*cken Lisa. 

Any position that we're facing each other in, I always end up making eye contact with it. And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. Every time. Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old. 

It's honestly ruining our sex life. 

I haven't told my bf any of this because I feel like I can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (I know lasers exist but I doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

Lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where I'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried I'm not attracted to him anymore.

I am attracted to him. I'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

What can I do in this situation? The thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

Should I talk to him? Am I overreacting? Is our sex life officially dead? 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and I can't stop making eye contact with it during sex.

Update: This has gotten a lot more attention than I anticipated. Some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. I'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. Currently debating whether I should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

Otherwise I've received some really phenomenal advice on how I should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. I was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before I made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. So thank you so much. 

I'll make a new post to update how things go once I've talked to my bf about all this. If he doesn't see this post first I think I'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

My wife is done with sex and Im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?,"Since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. She swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

We have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. No matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

Essentially...
- if I try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if I am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

Recently Ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but Im dying inside.

Is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? Or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? I dont want an affair etc, I want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

Boyfriend (21M) kisses me when I'm asleep lol should I tell him I know?,"So I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and I found this out pretty early on. He does cute stuff when he thinks I'm asleep. I'm a deep sleeper so I never woke up from it. I couldn't asleep one night and I knew he was walking past me and he blew me a kiss and just said ""love ya bitch"" while he was walking lol. I didn't know what to say because we hadn't said I love you or anything at that point so I just continued to pretend to be asleep. He actually does it all the time!! Sometimes he'll give me a kiss on my cheek or arm, or he'll say ""love you babe"". He is so sweet when I'm asleep!! He's not really affectionate like that when I'm awake, he kisses me but he doesn't randomly call me cute or something. And when I'm asleep, he can say ""did you know you're so cute"" like what!!!!???? Sometimes I pretend to be asleep because I like hearing it. And he'll tell his friends that he's not a pussy and he's so tough and everything and I'm like 🙄🙄 you literally come to me when I'm sleeping and tell me good night in this sweet voice. I never say anything though 

When he's sitting down doing something random, I just have the strongest urge to go up to him and give him a kiss and be like ""you're cute babe"" and maybe he'll realize that I KNOW. Or should I just continue pretending I have no idea???",relationship_advice
I (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. Wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. Idk what to do anymore.,"I'm posting because I cannot share this with my family and I can't talk to my friends either.

Wife and I have been married for 4 years, together for 12. Last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. My brother was my hero. He was there for me when my parents abandoned us. He was there for me when I struggled with depression. He's like a father figure to me. 

So my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. He told me that it was very important. We met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. He told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

Apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. And he also started suspecting it. I was really shocked by this revelation. Because my wife never told me about this. And I never imagined she would cheat on me.

But when I confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. She didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. But my brother claims it was consensual. 

We ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. I just want to kill myself. My brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. Wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

I'm really torn. I don't think my brother is a rapist. But I'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. Also, she never told me this. She had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. Idk what to do now. I think I'm just leaving. But I want some advice to cope up.",relationship_advice
Divorce on table because husband and I cant agree on baby's name,"Hello reddit. This title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23F) and my husband (24M). 
We've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. I got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. Ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. Its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. In the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. He really loved her and he never hid that from me but I thought it was over once she moved away. Now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and I can name the second child. When I asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. He doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
Is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name OUR child like that.

(Update) My [22f] boyfriend's [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)

&#x200B;

I don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

I received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. I was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. His mood has been pretty touch and go lately so I was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and I thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

I basically said I know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because I haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. I absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. I stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? You want me to get rid of him?""

I ***EXPLICITLY*** said ""No I would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. This is where shit started to hit the fan. He said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that I was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if I was fucking sick in the head.

I fucked up here. I shouldn't have said this but I don't handle confrontation well and I pretty much lost my cool at this point. I told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. He completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (I agree) and started calling me a number of names. He then started to get extremely personal saying I never cared about his little brother and that I'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

That is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. I still cant bellieve it and I don't think I'm ever going to forgive hm for that. Like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. He knows exactly how I feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? He can seriously go fuck himself because I'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

He then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes I know I'm basically killing his brother all over again??? I was crying so much at this point I didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. I have no idea where he's gone or where he is and I honestly don't even know if I care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

I still can't believe he reacted the way he did. He was like a completely different person. Not once in the four years I've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. I was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as I was.

THEN this fucking morning I get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for FORCING HIM TO REMOVE THE TATTOO. Apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them I've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

WHAT THE FUCK?!?! I EXPLICITLY TOLD HIM I WOULD NEVER ASK HIM TO DO THAT. When I told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. Feckin lovely.

I seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. I'm still in total shock and just so confused. I hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. I don't see what I could have done differently? I shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

I'm just at a complete loss right now. A day ago I thought of this guy as my future husband and now I just don't know. I wish I never said anything.

I've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him I've never seen before. Im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. How the fuk would we even move froward from this? Am I the one in the wrong here for the comment I made? I know I shouldn't have said it but I personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am I supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? Anything I sy is just going to sound like I'm lying in response to their negative reactions. I seriously have no idea what Im supposed to do here. I feel like this is going to ruin my life.

I just don't fucking know.

UPDATE: 41M Questioning Sexuality After Making a New Friend,"Going forward I will be posting updates via my profile. If you'd like to follow me, I invite you. I will post updates as I have them until I have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


UPDATE #2 FOLLOWING MONDAY'S NOTRE DAME GAME:

Leading up to Monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download Snapchat, which I had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. I bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. He has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

Anyway, so Monday rolls around, I'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. I knew he'd have other friends there, all of which I'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. I get over there around 2. He has one friend already there and is expecting more. They trickle in and I'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. We cut up after the game, played some pool, James had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. I was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so I could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what I did. I did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. After some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

I asked James if we could talk outside. We walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""I know I kissed you the other day, and I don't know if that was something I should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and I think I may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" I was absolutely out there now. No turning back, I basically just told him I had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. He didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why I haven't brought it up before now. Obviously I told him I had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the KISS! He reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. I could come to him with whatever was on my mind and I just teared up. It wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. I gave him a hug and told him I appreciated that, we sat down and I explained to him how confused I've been these last couple weeks. How this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. I sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. He is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things I said, they were all comforting. He told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. He is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. Not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. A few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.I don't know what I would call the gut feeling I had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out WITH him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. Do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  I felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. I have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. He explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but I shouldn't be pressured. I wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. I turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. Full on made out for what seemed like ever. It was the most satisfying kiss I've ever had. This where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) I'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

By this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and I had to go. He walked me to my car and we made out a second time before I got in. He told me to get home safe and I did. I texted him to let him know I got home safe and hopped in the shower. I was so emotionally charged that I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 AM. I ended up calling out of work Tuesday. James and I have plans to hangout again this weekend. He wants to go out for food and a place called Topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, I've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. I'm really looking forward to it and I'm just taking things day to day at this point. I know where we stand and I'm happy.

Thank you for all of your support. I have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. I just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. You only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. I am learning this myself and I'm telling you, it's liberating.

I'll post any other updates here, above this one.  If anything big happens in the meantime I will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

Lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on Saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. I was very observant in our interactions, however, I didn't want to be so observant that I overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so I went with the flow and the vibes were great. We hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when I had the opportunity in conversation I mentioned that I had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and I told him that although I hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and I thought I might be curious to try it. I delivered this passively, just so not to put HIM on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. It felt like the time to make a move but I just didn't do it. We were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and I just didn't do it. It was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. Plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

Fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time I've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) We got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new NBA 2k20 demo on PS4, I'll admit I'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but I kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. At the end of the night, around 11p I went to leave, I had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. I went in for our hug, when I pulled back I kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and I laid it on him, I went right in and kissed him. It was short, I didn't use much tongue, but I pulled back and said ""I guess I can say I've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, I guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, I had one on mine AND IT WAS FIREWORKS IN MY STOMACH. I played it cool, I left and texted him when I got home that I was home safe and I thanked him again for a good time. He replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. He asked if I wanted to come over Monday night for the Notre Dame game and a cook out, I told him I'd love to and I'll bring some ribs to cook.

We have texted as normal today and I can't tell you how excited I am for Monday and to see what happens next. I know I waited awhile to update but I felt like I had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so I wanted to wait until I had more to report. I will post another update in the comment section here after Monday.

Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. I feel like I'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",relationship_advice
[Update] I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"Hey folks.

In proper internetiquette, I'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. I received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. Your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. Even your scorn, some of you. I'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. But when I said before that I wanted to take all of it in, I meant it. I intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

To the meat and potatoes: **I got my money back.** It wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. It was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. I also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. I was surprised by the Bride, but I welcomed it. You should welcome all positivity. I said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. I feel like, thanks to you all, I explored every thread in the tapestry of how I should feel and what I could say. It brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. You saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. You saved me from rash actions and words I wouldn't have been able to take back.

I know some of you will wish I went off. But I want peace, and what's the metaphor? Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? I just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what I'm trying to say is, I know now that I was just as responsible for how terrible an experience I had. This isn't a self-blame thing, I'm not being low-self esteem. The fact of the matter is, I could have said no, and I could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way I was treated. From so many of you I've learned that this is called self-worth. Self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

Don't get me wrong. I still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. It's their wedding day. And this goes double for people you're very close to. But you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. And yeah, I accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. But from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, I should have reassessed the relationship. Measured my value without the context of Groom's friendship and focused on that.

I think part of the reason why I took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, I could stand tall as the good friend and person I know I am. Maybe some small part of me thought I could prove to the Bride that I was someone she should have always counted on. Show the Groom how a groomsmen should be. This was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. You should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. This can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. I know this now.

So what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? I think he made that clear. If I was so important to Groom, I'd have been by his side that day, but I'm not so important, and so I wasn't. This is fine. It was his decision, and I told him myself the day he told me I was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" It's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. Certainly not me. Not anymore. Ultimately, this means I maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. I have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. When you find the right people, there is no chase. And one day, I'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. I don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. We won't have hella cursive name cards.

I want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. I was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. I'm not going to be a doormat, but I'm also not going to be fucking heartless. If people need help and I can help, I will. I'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. I know that I'm a good friend, and a great person, and I'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

I know that I still have my problems and I'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, I want to encourage you: I used to be so self-conscious about myself, I'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because I didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. I used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping I'd go away. I used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. I'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that I still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

I mentioned I was always an overweight person, but I should also say that I've lost 122lbs to date and I'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). At my average weekly rate, I'll hit my goal in less than six months. If you're struggling similarly, I want you to know that you can do it (DM for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). Also, this was supposed to be a thing where I counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women I'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or I can't tell if they are (DM your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but I'm not so insecure about it anymore. I know that when women smile at me, it's because I made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. Finally, and this is key, I know who my friends are, and I know that I never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). I know that my real friends asked why I was working the wedding. They asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't I the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. They tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed I was down. They invited me in to pictures. They said they wished I'd had a better time. They commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. They told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how I go above and beyond for people. They told me that, at some point, I have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. Focus on these kinds of people in your life.

You'll have your lingering questions about this. I'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. If you have more questions, ask them and I'll answer. If you have more advice, I'm all ears.

I just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and I want to live up to that.

My [22F] boyfriend of 3 years [23M] and I just had a huge fight over a tampon.,"Yes. You read that correctly. The subject matter is... a tampon. To preface, I took a plan B recently and with that comes your period. So today I woke up at about 7 AM as I began my menstrual cycle. Going to skip the TMI, and simply say I had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). Unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. I asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. Just a straight up ""no I'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" I tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and I REALLY needed his help in that moment as I was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". I started crying bc I'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when I REALLY needed it. He is the reason I currently got my period anyways (plan B). Well I guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said I ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. In the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. I know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. I guess I'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. Was I being too dramatic or am I justified in wanting to break up over this? His reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. But to play the devil's advocate, he is a D1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. Sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before I move out and back home across the country. Bc if I decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

Edit: he is home from practice. Not sorry. Not remorseful. Still blaming me for doing too much. I can't stop crying. I showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and I'm stupid for taking advice from Reddit. I'm heartbroken.

Edit 2: I fuckin love reddit man. I'm sitting here crying but every response I read makes me feel a little stronger. I'm the biggest cry baby ever and I really thought I loved this guy. So naturally I'm super sad. But I need this. I needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. Thank you guys.

Edit 3: ok guys.. TMI WARNING.. some are saying why didn't I just put some toilet paper in my undies and walk downstairs. I slept naked and woke up to blood all over my legs. Ran to the bathroom and didn't want to get up and get blood everywhere. It was coming out profusely and I didn't want to get up until I was able to insert a tampon.",relationship_advice
My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",relationship_advice
Found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens,"This has been going on for several years. I live in a small rural neighborhood with an HOA where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. As with most HOAs, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. There will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. It really annoys my husband. I just laugh at it

Well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. There were a lot of emails sent about this. A lot of drama. I don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

So then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. Some people thought it could be deer eating them. There were several theories. The next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. This year it started happening again and people flipped out. All caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. Two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

It started out being funny because I'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. But this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

So anyway, you already know what happens. I walk down to the bottom of our property that I don't visit often and I find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. Like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

I went inside and told my husband jokingly ""I think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" He got this really weird look on his face and I had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

He confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. He was sneaking out at night to do this. I asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

I don't even know. This makes me really uncomfortable. The man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and I didn't even notice? Why wouldn't he just tell me? Like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

I don't know what to do. Can anyone help me think this through. Maybe I'm overreacting but I'm pretty upset

My [33 M] wife [32 F] hit me at a family BBQ. Everybody laughed.,"I don't think I'd ever felt more pathetic than I did at that moment. We'd gotten into an argument. She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"My[38m] wife [24f] of 3 years, took my daughter[14f] to visit her parents in Russia. Wife doesn't want to come back","Like above. Sorry for ranting and any grammar errors I've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. Also this is a throwaway so I don't completely dox myself. 

My wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. 

My wife herself was born there, and came to the US when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (This is NOT a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). I was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

As she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the US. It just kind of happened that way. (She entered on a F1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

Understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the US with my family and one in Russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

Until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as I have custody. 

As school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. She wanted to bring my daughter with her - I initially was opposed to this - but I caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

Through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on WhatsApp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and I don't expect constant alerts, but I would have liked a little more of an update. My daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

Yesterday morning I had texted my wife that I'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. She read the message but never answered. I told my daughter the same and she never responded. I assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

I had a hellish day at work so I went right to bed so I could be up early to go get them. 
I wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and I look at my phone to message them. I see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. Confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 Panicked I reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. She finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

Pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that I took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - I go off on her through text. She tells me off and stops answering me. 

I reach out to her mom through WhatsApp (who doesn't speak English at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. Her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

Panicked I go to reach out the US consulate in Saint Petersburg only to find online it was shut down in March and the nearest is in Moscow. I reach out to the Moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a HUGE help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. Even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

My wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. And her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

What the hell am I supposed to even do with this? The lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",relationship_advice
"My mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, I need advice","So I will try and keep this short.

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",relationship_advice
"I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.","
I am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 16 I slep with my good friend Jared . The condom broke and my daughter was created. My parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. I couldn't bring it over myself to. I wanted to keep the baby. Ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. So I did. I went to my friends house and his parents took me in. They weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

In that time my friend and I started to develop feelings for each other.

I had my daughter and about 2 moths later Jared's  brother  came back into their life's. He was a recovering Heroin addict. As we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
Eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. My parents got wind of that. They dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my MIL also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

So they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. It was a dark time I thought they were going to take my baby. In the end they didn't find anything substantial.

But them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. As it was a small town every mistake I made got back to my parents.

I was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? Cps charges because neglect.
I was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . Cps.

Christmas loads of people stayed at Jared's house because it was a big family. Cps because many strange men were there.

They eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. If they had done it more I think it could have been an offence.

The last call was 5 years ago.

Eventually Jared and I married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. We worked retail jobs and studied. It took us longer than average to graduate but we did. With a lot of help of his parents. Jared is now an engineer and I work as a graphic designer.

We were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. Our life's look normal now.

Anyway a week ago I get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

I don't really know what to do. Because while they didn't have to take care of my while I was pregnant I wished they had at least supported me. And while I get that they were panicking because they thought I was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",relationship_advice
My Fiancé took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.,"I'm in my late 20s and I got engaged for my fiancé (29) who I've been with for 9 years. Our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. But recently he brought up that he wants kids. I said no I'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. He got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. I just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

A week later I couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but I couldn't find them anywhere. Later that night he wanted to have sex, I said I couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, I supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. For the next few weeks we just used a condom and I didn't take the pill. In hindsight I should have got more when I couldn't find the original pack but I couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

On a few occasions we were having sex I noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so I said stop. The next day I was putting the recycling in the trash, as I was putting it in I seen my pills at the bottom. I instantly knew he had binned them. He knows I deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

It all made sense so I confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. He just kept walking away. I was so mad at him, it's not right. You can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. Does he have to carry it for 9 months? 

I haven't been talking to him, I'm so annoyed. ",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] My GF likes me to go by different names.,"TL;DR: Most of you were right, she was sleeping with Matt.


Here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

After I made my post, I waited 2 days to say anything to her because I wanted to get as much input as possible. I also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

I started reading comments right after I posted. I replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, I started to feel sick. I called my boss to ask for Friday off for personal reasons. I spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. We don't live together but I wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. We also have some good memories in that apartment and I think I would be sad if I had to continue to live there. 

This brings us to Saturday, the day I promised myself I would say something. I invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because I was getting so nervous that I completely lost my appetite. She walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. I was hoping to ease into it, but I ended up blurting out, ""I met Matt Blank"". She tried to act casual about it, but I could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. For the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, I talked about how I see the past 4 months completely differently. She started to cry and say she was sorry, I don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. I told her I'm going to work on forgiving her, because if I don't I think it will eat me up inside. I won't forget what happened but I'll at least try to move on. She started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. I interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

If I wasn't so emotionally crushed, I would have been amazed at the transition. She started begging me to give her another chance. I stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. I told her that I had already made up my mind to break up with her. After some back and forth, she realized that I was serious. I knew the exact moment she knew I was serious because she went from crying to yelling. It started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. It started off that I was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and I had a useless job. In the middle of her tirade, she said Matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

As she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. I'll summarize below:

She started sleeping with Matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. From there it went from once in a while to once a week. Matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. I think she was using the vacations because she missed being with Matt. 

I don't really remember the rest of Saturday. I spent Sunday with my friends which helped, I told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. I went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. I'm not sure what it said because I burned it. ",relationship_advice

I tried to just get him to relax and he did but I could tell he was irritated the rest of the night. He kept glaring at me and his demeanor was colder. It honestly bothered me, I wanted to cry I had to hold in my tears. I hate to be talked to like that by him. Why would he snap at me over nothing? I wasn't trying to make him feel like a ""bitch"".

"I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27M) phone. I am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.","First time poster so I apologize if this is rambly. To preface: I started dating David (not real name obv) at the beginning of February.  Only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship I was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that I didn't think much more about it. I fell hard and he did too. Things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and I can't afford the place by myself). He and I have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and I have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time I've known him, so I didn't really see any red flags there. Everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

Last week I came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and I played it off like I had no idea what he was doing. Fast forward to two days ago, I was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (I don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. So when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, I quickly peeked through his search history. There was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". I didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then I saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

I quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, I had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. I couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; I know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. So last night I peeked through his photos on his iPhone and was traumatized. There were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while I'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. I felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

A bit further up in his photos I discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. They all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. I was numb, i was angry, I was devastated, I couldn't think and I was so disturbed at what I was witnessing. I have never seen CP in my life and I can't get these horrible images out of my head. I scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

I guess I'm just posting here because I have no idea what else to do. I don't know how to confront him and I know I must separate from him immediately but I'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and I don't want to get in trouble. He must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  He practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. Not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially I am fucked by this. 


Please help Reddit, I feel so lost.

Well, it was time for the next round of shots recently.

The kids came home, and kept mentioning ""my poke"" ...... 

So he asked me if they got vaccines and I came clean. I said yes, and told him they started last year.

I apologized for not telling him. He wasn't happy.

No yelling, we talked more, and I explained the recent measles outbreaks nearby and expressed my concern for our kids.

All is well. No, we didn't even raise voices. Yes we kissed and made up.

He understands I did things for the kids, and not against him.

Happy ending. Safe kids. Goodnight Reddit.",relationship_advice
I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - [update],"Hey! A week ago I posted about the fact that I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and I wasn't sure where to go from there. I was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! I think I was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

The following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. On Thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. I was so nervous I thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. He said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but I was like no it's fine I haven't been home either, I knew it wasn't on purpose. The vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

Anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. And then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how I felt and he said 'sorry I'm not trying to make this a big thing I just want to make sure you're okay with everything and I want to make sure you feel respected'. I was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. I said that I was fine and that I felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. He said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. I said I agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. Then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

It was all really sweet and nice and I think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. At one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but I felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, I wanted to get to know you a bit. It was a spontaneous thing so I'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. We'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. And maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.' 

God he's great. Anyway, sorry it's nothing too exciting but I had a few PM's asking for an update so I wanted to let you know :) I'm really happy with the outcome and I'm sure we'll be good friends at the very least.",relationship_advice
"My(25M) Girlfriend(22F) wants to share our incomes, thing is, I make roughly 7 times as much, advice please","So here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. My girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, I finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company I did my internship at and within a year I got a promotion and a large payraise and I am now making roughly 150K a year, while she makes 20K a year.

Now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place I bought so I pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, Phone bill, netflix and so forth.

Now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently I pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

Now she seems to be jealous I got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs I put the majority in my savings account.

In my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

So what do I do, I hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if I am honest I am questioning my relationship as there is no way I am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

Edit: So, there are so many comments I am having a hard time keeping up with it. If I don't respond, know that I am trying to at least read your comment. But currently when I read and respond to 1 comment I get 10 more! Haha. I just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... Even those who yell about Mgow or something and those who are if the opinion I need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in!

My (22M) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together,"UPDATE ON THE BOTTOM

UPDATE #2 ON THE BOTTOM

UPDATE #3 ON THE BOTTOM

So I'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that I had since I was kid. 

She always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

But to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. He has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. Even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

When we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but I couldnt cuz I really love my snake.

Well now I came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

When I confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

I find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and I doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

I dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

I wanna confront her about it but I dont wanna seem like Im being petty

EDIT: When I brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying I always do this?? Idek what she even means by this



UPDATE: she dmd me this (im out rn)

UPDATE 2: I went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. Were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

UPDATE 3: Didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and I found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. Well with the gf, I am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now I have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

"UPDATE: My babies and I escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3AM last night... I'm scared, my kids are confused... I don't even know how I feel right now but nothing seems real.","Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

Thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. I was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

A little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

The dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. My kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". He asks for daddy nightly saying ""I just want daddy be happy. I just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but I just tell him I love him and hold him when he is hurting. I realized even being here I am happier than I ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. I don't feel like I'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

The shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. My 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and I've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

They have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. The attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. They are also filing a long term protective order. 

We have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

I will be starting work again next week. My HR manager contacted the store up where I am now to have me transferred because of the situation. I am so thankful the company I work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though I've had to take the last few weeks off while I get things in order. 

The shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on Wednesday for BOTH children while I start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. The daycare facility is wonderful and I'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while I start work again! 

Since I am able to start work again too I was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

I was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. I was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

A detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while I handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. The detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. So, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a Class C family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when I was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a Class A and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

He has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying I kidnapped the children and also filed a false CPS report. I handed over all evidence to CPS as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. He DID text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but I didn't respond. If I even let him see the children until things get worked out I risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

His mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to Florida so I would never see them again.... 

So, things are moving along. It has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but I've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. I feel like things are pulling together even faster than I imagined. It's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes I just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

I hope one day I can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources ARE available. It's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what I ever could have imagined and hoped for and I will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

Husband (31M) refuses to let me (23F) have a day off from the kids,"Me and my husband have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids together (3 yr old and a 7 month old). I've been a SAHM ever since we had our first kid and things have been going well for us. 

I moved away from home to be with him and I don't know anyone here. All of my outings have been with my husband. This weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and I told my husband I would love to have some time off so that I can meet up with her. He flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. His reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. Am I wrong to be upset over his reaction?

Edit: I'm so overwhelmed with the number of comments here + pms I've gotten. I can't thank you all enough.

"[UPDATE] My [30M] wife [29F] more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. I don't know what to do.","Here is my original post:  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0c1kd/my_30m_wife_29f_more_or_less_abandoned_me_and_the/)

I wanted to thank everyone for your help. This isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

A few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in English that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. But she thanked me and told me she loved me.

The funeral was held in Korea last week, i went with the kids. Her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. They also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

However this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. Even then there is a big language barrier between us. My ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

I still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. I don't really know how to feel about this at all. 

Just wanted to thank you all for the help and support.",relationship_advice
I (F25) found out my fiance (M27) is with me for money/family business,"To preface. My family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. Thus I am a trustfund baby. I try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
I met my fiance Mark when I was 20 and working as a waitress.

We began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

Now mark is not poor. He is upper middle class. And while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. I thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. What I want to say is that I never had the impression that Mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

In the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and I stood up for him and fought with my dad. They came to love and accept him. When Mark graduated Dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

Sunday I was supossed to work in the evening and I was going to stay with my sister. But I got a fever and was basically just non functioning so I stayed home. Instead of staying in our bedroom I made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (I didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so I just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

Mark came home when I was fast asleep and I was woken up by loud voices in our garden. I pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark Was there with a few friends. Just as I wanted to say hello I noticed that they were talking about me.

His friend kept laughing and calling Mark ""the man!"". Then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. Then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""Jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". Mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and I am free"".

At this moment I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. I kept hearing them calling me trust fund Barbie and stupid and so on. I didn't know what to do so I just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. I texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

I haven't returned home and just told Mark that I was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
My sister has been really worried but I just feel so ashamed about everything. My family was right mark is a gold digger and I fell for it. Even if I tell my family what happened I have no proof. My father can't fire him just because he is a dick. As far as I know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him I think. I just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

Edit : we are non us. Mark wasnt talking about anything else. He has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it I helped pay it off. There is no way he wasn't talking about me

Edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. I opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. We have called up dad and I will talk to him tommorow. I will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

Edit3: some questions have come up.

I don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. I mostly uber arround

I worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and I don't anylonger

I don't work for my father I am a company shareholder and I have to go to the general Quartal meetings but I don't work for him.

I am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. It was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. By pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

Last edit : I am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. Guess what. It's not fucking funny. You don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. You don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. I don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but I don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. It was deeply hurt full.",relationship_advice
My wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. I'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like I'm being unreasonable. Advice?,"Obviously, I keep some guns. Just for hunting and sport shooting.

I've got four rifles right now and I keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

Before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. After some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why I like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

So over the last couple months I have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. Taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. She's been learning a lot and doing a great job. And she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

She had a friend come over this morning. I already don't have a high opinion of this friend. I think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. I've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. But she's at least harmless so I never worried about her too much.

So this friend came over today. I figured the ladies would just chill out or something and I kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so I didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

At some point I saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but I didn't think much of it. Half an hour later I heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

I freaked a little and ran into the barn. I found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

In the immediate moment, after I saw the ladies were okay, I took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

So with all that sorted, I wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, I started to get mad.

I'm not necessarily proud of the language I used, but I'll try and portray it accurately since I am asking you alls opinions.

I asked the girls ""Why. The. *Fuck*. Was one of my guns pulled out?""

Friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

So then I asked why it was loaded. I *know* I clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so I know there wasn't a round in there. And I keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

Wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. Friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

They were making a ""Woops!"" Face that kind ignorant upset me more. And it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-I don't know, I stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

I locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. Friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

She approached me and just said ""Sorry"". I was still mad so I told her something like ""Yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

And then I asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. I know she knows better because I taught her!

I told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

My wife started getting defensive. She told me I've taken her shooting on our property before. The effect was the same here, right.

I told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. We *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

Wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. And I got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""Yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

My wife finally said it was just an accident and I didn't have to make such a deal over it, I told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

She walked away and as she did I said something to her like ""Do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" She got re-pissed at that and asked why I'm treating her like I'm her ""dad"". I told her that those guns are registered to me and I don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

And thats where we've been all day. We're kind of just avoiding each other. That sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. She is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. This is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

Like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake I probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

I *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because I never do that. And what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. So I'll probably apologize for the cussing here once I'm a little less angry.

So what should I do to handle this now? First big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. I don't want to talk down to her, but I do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or I'm not sure I'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. There is also the matter of her friend. Like I said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. That is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but I've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

How should I approach this? How do I get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can I get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like I'm trying to be her dad?

**TL;DR**: My wife pulled out one of my rifles without my permission, gave it to her friend, who then fired it negligently. I'm super pissed, wife is pissed that I'm pissed, and it's all a mess now. Help?",relationship_advice
My boyfriend (21M) hates my (20F) vagina with a passion,"I recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. He said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. He gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so I didn't push him to continue until I finished and I said he could stop. He doesn't like fingering me either. He basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. He said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

So I thought I had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. My inner labia are not long or stick out and I'm an innie or whatever. I taste and smell fine. I think he just doesn't like vaginas. But he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. No attention down there. I do cum but I have to touch myself because he won't do it. It's just basically like he's having sex with me and I'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so I can get off too. I don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? He's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when I wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. He just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. His penis is not beautiful I still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. Idk it's weird. 

My friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. My friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. Not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. My friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. My boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. My boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if I get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if I drip onto his sheets and dirty them. He will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. I get jealous sometimes. I wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. It sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. It's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. He's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. G",relationship_advice

TLDR: My family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making        up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ❤

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived here in America for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

Edit 2: I took out the part where RM tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  It was funny though. 

Edit 3: I added a TLDR. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments. 

The cops are yet to show up. 

Edit 4: GUYS WE FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE KEY BACK. FUCKING DAMN ITTTT

I (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f),"So our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so I gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. Turned out to be new activations, no big deal. Although, while on the main page I noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. Shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. I expect her to have a lot of texts. I got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when I text her at work cause shes busy.....Who could she be texting? I decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

I honestly dont know what to think. My curiosity got to me and I started plowing through old phone bills. This number started showing up on August the 8th. Since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. Often into the wee hours of the morning. Shes never mentioned any new friends... 

So I get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and I start helping her find it. I found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. I HATE being that guy but I did it. Checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. Some dude . She has him programmed first and last name. Checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. Looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and I also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! Said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

I love my wife and I trust her completely, i think. I dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. Or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. And actually now that I think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 I really dont like the direction this is heading. Am I reading to much into this? We've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. We havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. Not for lack of trying on my part. Shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. Anyone have any advice?

Tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since August; shits pointing towards infidelity but I'm trying to rationalize her actions...",relationship_advice

Hello everyone, I said that I'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response I got yesterday. In many ways, I was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but I found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. Thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200B;

I spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. He basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. We had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning I went back to the flat and confronted her. She was there (neither I nor her work on Saturdays), and I set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner I could.

&#x200B;

 Basically, I said that I didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. The wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. She basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". Look, I'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. I basically said that over the weekend I'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (I'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . Towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but I stood my ground and didn't change my course. Not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200B;

I left, and there is nothing much more to say really. As I type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). I'll be grand, being totally frank I feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  The coming days I'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"". ",relationship_advice
My [26F] girlfriend [24F] thinks she's an Instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!,"When I met my girlfriend 3 years ago, I knew very quickly she was addicted to Instagram. She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

This didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).

Other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by ""Insta time"" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

It was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

So the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. She desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. She's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but I didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for IG, she was actually trying to make money from it. I know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

Essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. Before you say it - yes, I'm probably going to break up with her. But the thing is, she's got a really good heart and I genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). Is there anything I can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

Tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an Instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",relationship_advice
Insecure GF Caught Flirting,"Throwaway for obviousness. This is gonna be a long one. 

Where to begin? Girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. Friends, coworkers, acquaintances. Even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

Fine. I love her. I understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though I've lost sleep over it. 

Girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. One of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. While I can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. Some of these stories I've never heard before. Call it insecurity but I've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. I asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. What?

A few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. We've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

But where is the line? He's already had her describe herself. Explain past relationships. Sex talk and favorite kinks. Taking until hours in the morning. Where is the fucking line?

I told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me I have nothing to worry about. 

Well. 

I just looked at her phone.

And while I wish I didn't. I'm glad I can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. They've been flirting. The questions via text were 10x worse. And her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her S/O. 

But what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that I'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that I'm creating disorder. Then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. And her saying yes. 

Not even 2 full days into 2019 and I'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

Username checks out. 

Do I ask for advice now or am I on the right track. I need clarity...

Thank you for making it this far. 

TLDR - Girlfriend who made me end friendships due to her insecurity ends up flirting with a guy she met 3 days ago and accusing me of being insecure about it. Her texts determined that was a lie.  Breaking up with her unless I'm overreacting.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE]I (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). My mom was raped. I don't know how to handle this.,"I posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. I finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and I wasn't prepared for it.

We were alone and I just asked if she loved me. I called her mom for first time in months. I wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. I just ranted to her without letting her speak. How I needed her attention and it's affecting me. I played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. I asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. I would stay out late just so that she would call me. I flipped and told her she should have never had me. I fucked up.

I made my mom cry that night.

She told me that she did love me. 

She revealed that she was raped by my dad. He was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. She became depressed and carried me full term. She is still recovering from her depression. My grandparents wanted her and I to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. At first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. This is why she has been distant from me. She doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. In the end she just gave up. I remind her of her rapist but she knows that I am gentle and kind. I didn't know what to say, I just hugged her. It was a hard truth to swallow. I told her that I will always be there for her. She told she didn't know I was hurting inside. I told her we can start again from scratch.

My mom joked that I scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. I cried as I went to sleep. I can't blame her anymore and I should make a better effort to be more involved with her. I want to support her. I'm not going to break off contact with her. I going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

I'll try my best to be a good son. Thanks for the advice.

I wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

Edit: Thank you for all the support. I will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

My daughter is dying of complications from cancer. My wife and I don't agree on final interventions. How do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?,"I apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. Too much ugly crying.

We have been battling cancer for many months now. Her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. Eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. Either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. She could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. The other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

If she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt CPR. We have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

If she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

Both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. Even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. On top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

I don't want either of these interventions as I feel she has gone through enough. My wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. I don't want her to suffer any more.

I don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. We have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. A part of me feels like a POS for not wanting to try anything but I just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

What do I do to find common ground. I tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. Perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. My wife and I have agreed on a plan. We are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. Please support childhood cancer research. No parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: I appreciate all the advice and I want to give another update. Firstly, my daughter is only 5. I don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. Either way this all happened rather quickly. Last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. She was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. Her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called VOD which came on her very quickly. Within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

She does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. The medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. She has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

My wife and I decided to try intubation again but say no to CPR. She was intubated a couple hours ago. So far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. Both my wife and I are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

Thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. We'll take all the positive energy we can get.",relationship_advice
"My (18M) girlfriend (F17), is threatening to kill herself every time I express discomfort, and today when I got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself","I feel extremely trapped at this point. She was such a great person when I met her and I thought we would be great together.

Unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. For example, I could not hear a line of what she said over FaceTime because of internet issues and she flipped saying I don't pay attention to her. Proceeded to call me names or whatnot. Usually, I just took and it moved on. However, today I just snapped and told her to leave me alone. So I proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and I check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

I just ignore it because I really did not feel like it.  Then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. I honestly think I'm traumatized from those videos, I can't seem to get them out of my head and I feel responsible for them. I texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. Thankfully she's still alive and I've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but I don't feel right. 

I feel trapped, and very fucking sad. I feel as if I'm a monster and I'm causing her to do these things to herself. I never say anything badly to her, I just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. I apologize for my rant but I don't know. My emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

I hope I can get some advice. For some insight, I don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. She gets annoyed that I don't give her attention, but I text her and hang out with her as much as I can possibly give, I am human and a student with responsibilities, I can't spend 24 hours with her.  

That's really all. 

Update: 
Just a slight update. I have been in contact with her father and I am being updated on what's happening. They are seeking professional help for her and I feel that is the right choice for her. I am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so I'll try and give updates as I can. Fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. In my case, I've decided it's going to do me harm if I continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

My mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and I'd much rather regain my positive nature. I am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. I've read every story and the decision I made has been influenced by your own experiences. I will try and reply to all the messages, but I apologize if I miss anything. I'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. I have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and I hope she comes to see what I chose to do a few years from now.

Thank you!
If my spelling or grammar sucks, I'm pretty exhausted, I apologize.

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn't know she'd be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn't gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

I can't say hearing all this helps. I don't really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"My wife and I are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in. 

Am I wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? I honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. I'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.",relationship_advice
I [22F] read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.,"I honestly don't even know where to start here... I haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because I function better when I'm not around my family all the time.  I think and function differently from them, which is something I thought was OK and not a source of conflict until this morning.  I'm moving in a month for grad school so I moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  The entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  It's been really upsetting but I've tried to push it aside.  I've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

I am aware that what I did was wrong / I shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  Everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so I opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  I don't know what exactly I was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, I don't know, but I was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  Like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* I am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know I can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  I'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  My mom says things like ""It's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch I have ever met.""  They say I bring down the mood, I walk into the room and I'm a bitch, etc.

There are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying I'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  So while I'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable I am.

I think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  I came out to her in December after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community and I was terrified to tell anyone.  I told her I wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  They are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

Growing up I was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what I was supposed to.  I am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  I've also worked since I was fourteen.  I pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  In college I had a 4.0 and I got into multiple top PhD programs straight out of undergrad.  I won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  I am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

I know snooping was wrong and I'm not sure what I expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  I've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but I tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  But these were not mere hunches, they are true.  I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and I'm honestly not sure how I should proceed from here.  Should I try to bring things up with my family?  Should I just bide my time for the next few weeks until I move?

TLDR: I knew my family was talking about me behind my back so I read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  I initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  I am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and PMs offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know I see you and appreciate you very much!

Some people have shared that I've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  I want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  I was simply trying to share that I've had multiple achievements that I would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  Success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**EDIT 2:** Just going to answer a few of the common questions I'm seeing in the comments here.

* Yes, my family is religious.  They are Catholic.  I am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* No, I do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  In fact, I hardly talk politics.  I do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  When my parents are talking politics, I merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  I pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles I prefer to have.
* Yes, I have friends.  No, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  I generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* My relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* No, I am not adopted.

**EDIT 3:** Copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  A lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  Here's a bit more context that I definitely should have provided earlier:

The issues with my sister started after I came out to her! This is definitely something I should have clarified, I'm sorry. Here's the story:

I was dating this really awesome girl in December who has been out and proud since middle school. I was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so I decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. I figured baby steps were the way to go, so I started with my sister. My sister and I have told each other a lot of private information in the past and I thought I could trust her with this. I was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. However, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. So I figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. I told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. But after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. She began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. Now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and I felt like I had some support with them. But once I came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

In early July, we were at our cousins' house and I was in the bathroom. The house is small with thin walls and I overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. So I realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. At this point I realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but I still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. Well, she did. I'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

I'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. Well, here is some more. This situation is complex and something I am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that I am in the dark here as well.",relationship_advice
Update 2 my ex girlfriend (21F) spent the night at a random guys house.,"Sorry for making another post but I got a ton of messages saying what did she say etc. like 30 so I'll just make a quick post 

Basically she saw my text, freaked out and did the whole ""no you're not breaking up with me, I didn't do anything, what are you saying, we're still together"" and she said she's getting a flight home early. I just ignored her texts 

She also called me about 100 times for our ""morning FaceTime call"" and I declined her. I wanted to tell her that I had a girl in my bed and we're eating pancakes but that's petty af so I didn't 

Yeah idk if I should talk to her when she gets back or just ignore her. I kind of just wanna be done with her. Even if she didn't cheat it's not right to be in bed with someone else and stuff that's not ok",relationship_advice
I (29M) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28F) rich family,"My girlfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. She's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. But every time we visit her family I start doubting everything. 

They are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. I come from a very middle class background. I have a good education and a decent career that I really enjoy, but I'm definitely not rich. Because of this, they view me as a loser.

For example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish Honda. When we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. She was furious we didn't bring GF's Land Rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. GF doesn't like to drive on long trips and I'm not allowed to drive the Land Rover (per her parents) so we brought my Honda. 

GF's dad has never spoken to me directly. Even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""What does he do?"" So we went in the house and I gave her dad the usual, ""Hi, merry Christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

One more example: Last year I made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. It was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and I even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. GF's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to GF they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

We managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which I'd normally consider a win. But today I keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if I'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. GF and I have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but I know they'll never accept me. If we get married I'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. GF has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but I can tell it bothers her too. They bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and I think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

So, not to sounds like an asshole, but am I wasting my time? Is this relationship doomed? GF always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but I'm not sure that's true. She always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. But I know I'll never be good enough for them, even if I'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: My girlfriend's rich parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",relationship_advice
My boyfriend told an old crush of his that he's single.,"We've been together just over a year now. I went on his computer (Facebook was already open on a tab) and I saw he was talking to an old crush of his. She said she was single and when she asked him whether he was in a relationship he said that he wasn't. She even asked him why and he said he didn't know. I don't know what to think now because this seems really out of character for him.

Edit: we broke up.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard,"[Previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

Short EDIT at bottom.
&nbsp; 

We met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. I was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so I suggested we meet at her place, so that I could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

Even though I thought I made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my GFs coworkers figured out who the post was about (GF's age, working HR [which I mentioned in a comment], same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my GF. The reason she wanted to meet early was because she was FURIOUS that I had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' In a sense, I guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. My GF never used Reddit so I figured I was safe.
There's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


Anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that I made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. I asked her to point out ANY part of it that wasn't true, or where I had lied. Long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. I definitely raised my voice when I told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. I told her I only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. The post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

She began to tear up and asked me if I really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. I asked her if she understood that this WASN'T ABOUT THE KEYBOARD. It was about the way she acted towards me when I was trying to do her a favor. She stayed silent and didn't answer. I asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was OK with her. I asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

She got really defensive, asking ""Are you calling me crazy?"" and ""Do you think I'm unstable?"" I had no idea where she was going with this. I told her I wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that I was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

We talked in circles for a bit, and I tried to pry it out of her. I still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. When I realized our conversation was going nowhere, I finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. She asked, ""What do you want from me?"" and I said, ""I want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

I'm getting tired of typing so I'll wrap this up quickly. She was absolutely unwilling to apologize. She thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. We talked for about 5 more minutes before I told her that I don't even care anymore. I told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. That we should just break up. I didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

As I was leaving, she asked if I wanted the keyboard back. She didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. I could tell by her tone of voice. I told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

I've been getting TONS of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my FB). She obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like I really did leave her over the keyboard. I couldn't care less, as I'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

We only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, I don't feel terribly heartbroken. Mostly just relief that it's over. But...also confusion. Still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

TL;DR: She wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. After an exhausting conversation, I decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**And to the people who had some unkind words towards me because I use a Razer keyboard: Pound sand, dorks. I like what I like.**

VERY SHORT EDIT: She called earlier today and was very apologetic. My assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how I was right for leaving her, among other things. I told her that she had her chance to apologize.",relationship_advice
"Girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time""","So before your read, I need to say I have nothing against cuddling to sleep. I actually love it.

The problem I have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

And honestly I wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

But no, she doesn't want it like that. She absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

If I just start to get sleepy (wich I am because I want to sleep), she will get upset.

She absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because I have to keep my eyes open too.

She also needs sweet talk, wich I like but not when it's forced like that. She literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""I love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what I think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... And honestly I have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. And we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like I never say it.

But the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. And that can take some time. Sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

I know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with SO, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when I tell her I'm tired and I want to sleep.

If I say I'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""No ! Don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so I have no say in it.

Seriously, I think she's just being too clingy and childish. Is it unreasonable to just say ""good night I love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? I don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if I don't do enough.

I feel like I have no control over when I can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for SEVERAL HOURS.

Honestly I wish I could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but I can't. It's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when I'm tired.

Could I have some insight ? What do you think ? Am I being unreasonable ?

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT: Thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, I will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. I feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now I'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. I will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

Boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship,"My bf and I have been together for over 4 years. When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don't know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?

Edit: I've changed the ocd to perfectionist. I'm so sorry to everyone I offended!

Edit 2: I'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. Thank you to everyone who responded, I love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

A little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. Because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. Neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. That was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",relationship_advice
Update: I [34M] broke up with my [33F] girlfriend in the nastiest way possible because of what happened yesterday and today.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

So after I went home yesterday, I cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

I called her, she accepted my call and said ""What?"" I told her ""I'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

I texted her, ""I need the copy of my house keys back, I'm breaking up with you.""

She didn't respond. I got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

I looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. So I texted her ""Where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

I drove back home and I noticed her car parked next to my house, I carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there I see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my iPad...) that's when I tell her ""What are you doing?"" 

She tells me, ""I'm taking back what's mine."" That's when I tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""Get off me."" She started kicking me and ran out the house.

I tell her to give my shit back or I will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so I whip out my phone and dial the cops.

She drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my iPad.

Cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and I told them what happened and I tell them the location of her house.

They sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

The cops start asking me questions like ""Is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later I got my stuff back.
She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

Now I'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

Edit: For everyone questioning of how she got arrested on the same day, she let the cops in and confessed what she has done.",relationship_advice
My husband wants me to get a boob job," We've been married for 6 years. I have smallish breasts which I am ok with but my husband is often suggesting I have a boob enlargement.

He also often talks about his hair as he's becoming bald, it's absolutely not a problem for me and I made some small jokes about it in the past but he's convinced it is a problem. He wants to get an hair transplant and he usually brings that up when he talks about my boob job, almost like he would undergo that procedure ""in exchange"" for my boobjob. He'd probably look better with more hair but I still love the way he looks now and I don't need him to change.

"UPDATE My (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. Am I being unreasonable in ending it?","Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbot23/my_29m_girlfriend_24f_cancelled_weekend_plans_to/).

&#x200B;

We spoke via text and then I called her at lunch. It escalated where I was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that I should trust her.

&#x200B;

I stated they can be friends, but I expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because I know better.

I expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

She doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200B;

I don't think she cheated. I know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. Accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

UPDATE: I'm [37/f] unexpectedly pregnant. My husband (35/m) wants an abortion and to keep it quiet. I'm not comfortable with this. What should I do?,"My original post was some time ago, so newcomers may not have seen it. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



I wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. First though, I'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. For the most part the community came through with useful advice. I really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


An now on to the update. I'm 39 now and my husband is 37. I was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. I told the therapist about the advice I got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. I went through with the pregnancy. My husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. He decided to stay. 


Not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. Reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. Our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. I see the world in a different way now that I have her. He loves our daughter with every bit of himself. Amazingly my love has grown for this man. He has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. I understand what he means. The happiness that I feel is beyond words. Both my husband and I are so thankful that we had our daughter. We talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. To top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


So thank you, reddit. Your support helped me through a difficult time. I hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


EDIT: Holy schmoly reddit. Pinned and gilded for the first time! Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. Thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. I have read and appreciate every one of them. I'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!). ",relationship_advice
My husband committed suicide Saturday and I'm wondering how to handle this regarding our 2 year old,"I absolutely don't want him to know that he took his own life... ever...

Is reminding him everyday harder? He's been saying ""I want my daddy to be here"" or ""my daddy is at work"" and he doesn't seem sad. Just confused. I know he feels all of this. My mother told me it's a bad idea to show him pictures constantly. I just feel like... I don't want him to forget his dad. This has been so hard. I just need some guidance.

My mother (50F) asks me (20F) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15M),"Hi everyone,

This morning I was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. She has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. He is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. He does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. If he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. I would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. He has just not grown up. My birthday day out to London was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and I was called selfish as a result. I am 20, I've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

Previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. Yesterday, she called me to ask if I would come home from uni on Wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. A sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. I am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. She had been preparing for this for a while. I said I wasn't happy about it, but I didn't have plans that day, so fine.

This morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. I thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. But actually she now wants me to come back Tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. Tuesday evening is the only time I get to see my boyfriend this week, so I said no. The reason she wants me to come back is so I can wake my brother up for school Wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. I told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. At this point I just said I wasn't having this conversation and hung up. I then text her to explain that I don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, I have a busy day on Tuesday, and it's just not practical. Plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. I shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

So, am I being unreasonable? I understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. I am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. If my brother had to be left alone for days of course I would come back, or if something sudden happened. But he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. He should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

Any advice at all would help.

TLDR: My mum is going to a funeral on Wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 YO brother up for school. She has a history of babying him and I'm a university student with my own life in a different city. Am I wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as I have other plans? Edit: typo. 

Update: I called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that I was a disappointment to the family. He said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do I should always help where I can- it was the principle that counts. He also said I was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot I should be doing at 20 that I'm not. When I asked what I should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as I live in a big city and the only reason I'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when I can easily bus/train everywhere. He knows this. He then repeated he was disappointed in me and I hung up the phone, upset, after saying I don't know want more they want me to do. I had a job I've saved my wages from so I can budget accordingly, I do well at university, I am good with money, I have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, I make time to see my parents when I can. Currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. Thank you for your support though, everyone",relationship_advice
Thinking about abandoning pregnant GF...,"My GF is pregnant and I was really excited to be a dad when I first got the news. Problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of Down syndrome. A follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has Down syndrome.

I want an abortion because I am not prepared to raise a child with Down syndrome. This is not me bashing Down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something I'm prepared to do. My GF doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing I can do about that.

At this point I'm considering just ending the relationship. I'd pay whatever I'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. My GF obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but I feel like I have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with Down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

Anyway, I'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my GF. I obviously have to tell her ASAP so that she can make an informed decision.  But I don't want to come across as manipulative.

I realise I'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but I genuinely care about my GF and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I [22F] just found out my boyfriend [27M] has been having sex with me when I'm sleeping after I've taken sleeping pills.,"[Previous post can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the TL;DR is in the title. I have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. I'm pretty much dead to the world when I take them. Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while I was knocked out despite me saying that I wasn't up for sex before I fell asleep. I woke up that day because I was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. He didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200B;

Now for the update. after I found out what happened, I went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. I'm so incredibly lucky to have him. It was from his house that I made the last post. After that post, I was replying to the comments until I fell asleep. The majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that I need to break up with him and report him to the police. That was something I didn't wasn't to have to do. When I woke up in the morning, I had almost 600 more replies and I got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what I was going to do. So that is exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

I had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why I wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. I went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200B;

So I called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. I started to explain everything to him and why I had to go away for a while. The conversation was going okay at the beginning. But then it took a turn. As soon as I brought up the fact that I wold him no to sex before I feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. He started yelling. He started throwing things. He got scary violent. Telling me that he knew I was insinuating that he had raped me. Saying I was accusing him of something very serious. I hadn't said to him that he had raped me. I hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that I was going to give him another chance.

&#x200B;

Then things took another turn. In my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. I don't want to come off that way so I am not going to disclose what happened. I'm still trying to process everything and wondering how I could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200B;

I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. You have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me I was the one who was wrong. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I was wrong. But I think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision I had made. Maybe it was better that way because now I know for sure. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now I'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some people have asked of he is now my ex. I guess I didn't really directly say that he is. We are no longer together. And never will be again. Even if I decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: It's come up a lot. People are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. My brother did report him. Another thing people keep asking is what happened. Call me an attention seeker if you want. I don't care anymore. What I left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. If my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. It's so embarrassing, not just that I was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",relationship_advice
(UPDATE):My MIL exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). Who had no idea. Wants him to divorce me. Please help me.,"Tldr: MIL told my Husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where I wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. Hubby and I are solid. She then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the Christian thing. 

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick update about a post I made 5 days ago on here. You were very kind to me. Thank you. It got locked and deleted because I had the wrong username so I've just made another account and added the ""throwRA"" to my normal username LullabelleAnabelle, so I can make a quick update for this subreddit. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to my post because I posted it on another subreddit too. A lot of you suggested I go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. Thank you everyone. You're wonderful. 

To clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if I may). I'm not American, European born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. We met at his friend's wedding where I did the bride's makeup (I'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). We had some serious words, mostly where I told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and I fell hard. And you guys are so right, he is the best person I have ever met. He's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. And he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. So I think I'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. He's just my world. 

It hasn't been easy. A few things have happened and I can't honestly say that I'm better off for it. But I'm trying.  Again, really not a troll post. I'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. This is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

I didn't know how to tell him. Or what I wanted to tell him. A bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, I didn't want to show him ever. So, I told him I could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. They aren't particularly easy to read. Those men weren't very nice to me. They had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. And they had gone to jail. 

He got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. That I didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if I didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second I was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. He'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. He wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. He said he was so scared that I would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. And he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. They were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. Nothing malicious or accusing. 

I thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. She'd taken pictures of the parts where I described things that had happened almost too vividly and then I had pointed out ways I could have defended myself and questioned why I hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way I looked and wanting them to do those things to me. Its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. It was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so I didn't have to think about the ways I could have stopped it. Maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all I had, I never went to therapy. She put in her message that I had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof I was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

His sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. And to the other siblings and some others in the family. Fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

Things haven't been going well. My husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. He's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. He won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. He owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. But I'm trying to get him to not do that. It's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. I don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

As for me, I'm just in a fog. I don't know how to process what she did, so I'm not going to until I'm ready. My husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. I think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. I'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. It sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. I hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows I thought like that about myself. I never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. Its just shit. 

I won't be posting on here again. 
Thank you all for your lovely words. I hope you take care.

Edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. And thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much I must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. No.",relationship_advice
"I(F32) just found out that my husband(M36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(F29) "" just knocked on my door.","Sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. I am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

I thought that I had a pretty happy marriage with ""Jonas"". We have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. We have twins (f8).

Jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. During this time he will visit us and we will visit him. It is I convinient but he earns really good. So good so that I needn't work if I didn't want to.

During all those years I have never suspected him if cheating. He was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

So this comes all of the blue for me. Jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
A woman knocked on my door. She introduces herself as ""cherry"". When I asked her what it was about she broke down crying. I took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about Jonas. Apparently she and Jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

We were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. He has 2 different sets of social media accounts. And as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

At first I was livid and screamed at her. Till I calmed down as she was just a victim.

Apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if I visit) trough some bank statements. She searched his keys and went snooping. There is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

We both cried our eyes out together. Cursed out Jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

She is not legally married to Jonas as he sold her the ""I don't believe in marriage Spiel"". The only legal spouse he has is me. I know I have to divorce him but maybe I just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. Also should I keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

Edit : I guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

Thanks for the few helpful advices I have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. I honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but I guess it's if I wanted that I needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

Thanks for the people that did tho. Cherry has left and I will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. I will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",relationship_advice
Should I end my relationship with my GF for ruining my birthday?,"This may sound petty, but I am genuinely pissed and don't know how to handle this situation.  I don't usually do much for my birthday, just normally go out to eat.  Yesterday being my birthday, I asked my girlfriend if we could dine out at one of the local Mexican restaurants on my town after I got off work.  She said probably not, as she was going to be pretty busy that day, which is understandable as she is currently going to school and is nearing midterms.  A couple of hours after getting home from work, I got a call from her asking to pick her up from the very restaurant I asked if we could go to, as she went out with her friends and got a little tipsy.  I of course went ahead to pick her up, as I didn't want her to drive home drunk.  I haven't said a word to her since, and she doesn't seem to understand what's wrong.  I feel hurt and unloved, and don't know how to approach this.",relationship_advice
Update to caught my (27M) girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bt4yar/caught_my_girlfriend_24f_masturbating_and_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Damn I got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. Reading your comments made me realize that I'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. She didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which I relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. But it was different in my house, they knew or assumed I would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. I got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. She told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

It was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. No judgment, it was nice, I missed her. Basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. She tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. So when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

And then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when I saw her, she felt embarrassed. She admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. I told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. Obviously I didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. I tried telling her that I knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and I still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. So that's that. She didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. I know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and I said that it was so hot and I wanna watch her. She felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. We're good now. Had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

Thanks for all the help. I knew I wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. We talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

Some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. That's definitely not it lol. And just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. I did not make that post thinking ""wow my BITCH girlfriend has double standards, I should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for WEEKS, how fucking dare she, I'm gonna get revenge"". I love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. I can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. Some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. And the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. Again, real lack of empathy. No one's perfect, everyone has their own problems.",relationship_advice
I [M28] Just broke up with my girlfriend over something she [F27] posted on Facebook. Justified? Did I overreact?,"So we've been together about 7 months. We've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. But something I found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much I ended our relationship.

Some backstory for context: About 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. It started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. We both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

Fast forward to tonight. We're laying in bed and I realize I never accepted her Facebook friend request. I literally never use Facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. But we weren't doing anything else so I decided to accept the request and check out her Facebook (She was right next to me the whole time).

What I found really upset me. Multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. They were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

The first one I found was this: ""Hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... Like they are important to you..."" I think ""Hmm, is this about me?"" I feel like I make her feel important all the time. I drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. She had a birthday and I did all the things that you would expect: Multiple presents, dinner, I offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. I often buy her things just because. I offer her lunch nearly every day to show I'm thinking about her...

Ok, maybe I'm overreacting on that one I think. That post could be about anything or anyone, so I keep scrolling. I see another one: ""If you push me away, I promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... Hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. And I was a bit upset at seeing it. Especially considering I never felt like I was pushing her away. I spend literally every free moment I have with her. She got upset that I wanted some alone time. She says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why I need it, so I pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. We are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. I never felt like I was pushing her away. If anything, I felt like I spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

I keep scrolling, and I found the one that hurt me the most: ""Don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. What you won't do, someone else will.""

That one absolutely killed me. I never thought I was taking her for granted. And the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. On top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than I do...

I confronted her about these posts. She said they don't mean anything. That she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

I took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then I went back through our text messages to each other. Turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. That last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

It just felt so terrible. Like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? That's what it seems like to me. Am I out of my mind for thinking that? She made me feel like I was. She said I was overreacting. That she felt that way in the moment, but not now. But I can't stop myself from thinking ""If you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

Then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on Facebook. Anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. By sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""I'm having relationship problems!!!"". I can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (They were all posted within this past month). To an outsider, I must seem like a fucking asshole. Not treating her right. Not respecting her. Not making her feel important.

I just felt disgusted. I felt like I was going to vomit. I just kept seeing the words ""What you won't do, someone else will"". I know she didn't write them. But she thought them. She agreed with them. She broadcast them to the world.

I told her I knew myself well enough to know I wouldn't forget it. That anytime we had any minor argument, I would be thinking ""Guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than I do"". I don't think I could deal with it. Knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. Instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

I broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. It was ugly. I feel bad. I feel tired. I've had no sleep and I have to work in like 3 hours. I don't even know why I'm posting this. The relationship is over. Maybe I overreacted, maybe I was justified. I just know it felt right.

Edit: lots of people saying I jumped to conclusions. I do not feel I did. The conversation went like this:

Me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? There is a lot of them. (This was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

Her: why? Do you not like that I do that?

Me: I mean... It kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

Her: but those posts could mean anything. They could be about anyone.

Me: I just have a feeling that if I went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

Her: yeah, maybe some of them...

We left it at that for about 10 minutes, then I decided to actually check those times and dates. They all lined up, I went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. I stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

I then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. I may have jumped to a conclusion, but Imo it wasn't a very far leap. And she confirmed that I was right.",relationship_advice
Fiancé has Dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn't know he has them and women he's said he's never been with.,"Me: 30F
Fiancé: 38M

We've been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. Throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. When I asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

This past week, I was playing a game we play together on his iPad when a questionable text came in. I went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. Being really angry and insecure about it I then went through his phone. We have access to each other's phones to play each other's dumb games when one of us isn't felling well but I have always respected his privacy up until this point.

What I discovered was a Dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women's initials. In each folder was pictures of nudes his ex's and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while I was so black out drunk I couldn't remember them being taken. 

Several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that I had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and I love you's. 

After some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. He is an IT professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

I checked through time stamps and I don't believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. I am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker's privacy as well.  He insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. I feel like I'd be very disturbed if I were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

Regarding the original girl, he just didn't want to tell me because he thought I'd be mad. I am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  After we hashed this out, I asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there's anything else I should know and I wouldn't get mad. He lied. Two days later I found this personal ""porn"" stash. 

I am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? Is this grounds for ending the engagement? The relationship as a whole? Part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time I just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn't be restored. 

He claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which I'm sure I can believe but I don't have any experience with this but I'm just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that I don't know how to make a rational decision right now.

Edit: First I want to thank everyone reaching out. This relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but I was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. I can't help but doubt myself even though I know in my heart that this just isn't right. I'm shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. I feel like I can't even turn to my own friends and family because I'm embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. I probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason I always felt like I was to blame. What's going on is beyond not ok and I am now figuring out what my next steps will be. Thank you again for all of the support.

Edit #2: Regarding the ""secret porn stash,"" it wasn't porn from the internet. I was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. I was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. I was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. It was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed.",relationship_advice
[Update] I (19F) snooped on my brother (23M) and found something horrifying,"Link to previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf6oib/i_snooped_on_my_brother_and_found_something/)

We just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. I know I said in the last post that I wasn't going to do anything about it, but I found that I couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

So I spoke to my brother.

We were alone, though our mother was in the house. It filled with lots of crying. He basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. I only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. I told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

He asked that I not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. Sounded fair, so I agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

In a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. Not sure how to better describe it. We most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and I hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy.

Daughter's friend (F18) is making me (M45) uncomfortable,"I have known this girl for years. She always was a sweet girl and one of the things I always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. Her family life is stable as far as I know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200B;

But around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and I, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. When I'd overhear, I'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200B;

Then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. I acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? It stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when I try to tell her to stop.

&#x200B;

So, to avoid anything else, I cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. But the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if I don't pick her up. So I pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where I was having trouble driving, and every time I stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200B;

The first time I got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. The second time, she didn't and it was bad. I was telling the truth, and even I thought I was a sleaze. I told her mother that I was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, I'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200B;

I really don't know what is going on here. I am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like I am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. I have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200B;

I am sure that something else is going to happen, and I just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Edit: For the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

I have known this girl for 10 years. She was less than three feet tall when I first met her. She has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. She has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. She is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

I want her to find true happiness in her life and I want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. The last thing I want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. I am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**So for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200B;

**2nd Edit: A few questions answered**

1. My relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. She became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. She blamed me for her arrest and moved away. There has been no contact from her since she left. I have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. My friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. She has very little contact with her father. For example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. The mother is an immigrant from Greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. I gave her a ride because I have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. When I was that age, I did not call my parents when I was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger I was in. I am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. My daughter's friend is not the only one I have given rides to.
4. My daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. When she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that I have to stay away from her.
5. It really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. But at this stage I have to.
6. I don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions I do, I am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

I build my (26M) relationship on a lie and I dont know how to tell my gf (24F) or what to do," I met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, I commented on it as I broke the ice. We talked a bit and she turned out to LOVE dogs and I just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and I wanted a date.

Things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what I mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. I only really saw her dog when I was picking her up and I would never come in so I had no interaction with it.

Thing is she moved out to her own place last week. She now wants to hang out at her place. I would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

I am really, REALLY afraid of dogs. I know I should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. I mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? And then the more time passed the more embarassed I felt. Especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and I just... how can I tell her I'm one of those people? Except I'm afraid of ALL dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

How do I fix this? I don't want our relationship to end because I can't man up and just act like a normal person when I'm in a room with a friendly dog... I fucked up and I dont even know what to do here",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (27M) Have Unknowingly Been Using My GF's (27F) Ex's Molded Dildo to Get Her Off,"Previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/a4cky3/i\_27m\_have\_unknowingly\_been\_using\_my\_gfs\_27f\_exs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4cky3/i_27m_have_unknowingly_been_using_my_gfs_27f_exs/)

So, we had the talk. My relationship is over. After some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late Saturday, I brought it up. She again tried to deflect and change the subject, but I demanded we stay on topic. I told her outright how I felt, how I thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. She tried to play it off like I was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. Then she spun it into a penis size issue. I kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her Ex-BF and NOT the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. I told her I wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and I was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

The conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say I have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. I knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so I outright told her the relationship was over.

Thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. They were helpful and confirmed my feelings. Now I guess I will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. I'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

My(37m) wife(39f) just told me that she initially faked love when we were dating me only for the money and admitted to cheating on me. But she claims that she fell in love with me after we got married. I need some advice here.,"My wife and I have been married for 8 years and we dated for a long time before that. I own my family business ( fashion and jewellery ). We have 2 daughters.

First off, I'll be honest with you guys. I'm not an attractive person. I look average at best. I don't have a chiselled body, but I'm fit. My wife is really beautiful and I always wondered what she saw in me. I was bald at 19, so I hope you guys get the picture.

When I was in my twenties, I was very awkward and introverted. I didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. I met my wife in college. We had similar interests and I fell in love with her. I asked her out and she said yes. I was on cloud nine. And we never looked back. 

Yesterday was our anniversary. We had a small celebratiion. When we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. I was really worried because I did not understand why. She hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. She ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. She also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. But she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. She told me that she really matured at that time and realised that I was the mist important person in her life. She also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. She told me because she really felt guilty. She told me that she would do everything to make it up. 

I was really devastated. I always kind of wondered what she saw in me. And I think I have my answer now. I'm broken. I also know that I only know this because she confessed. I don't know what to do and I need help moving past this. Can you guys help me with some advice?

Edit: Thank you guys. I have decided that I'll do a paternity test and make my decision based on the outcome.

Edit2: Also, I've asked her to move out till the paternity tests are out.

Edit3: Though she fell in love with me now, I think I've fallen out of love now. I think I'm done with this relationship. Thank you guys. I gotta work, so I won't be replying anymore. Once again, thank you for listening to me.",relationship_advice
Happy Update: I'm (34m) really into this girl (27f) who is the complete opposite of me. I'm afraid dating her will ruin my reputation.

I'm not sure if anyone will read this but it makes me happy to write about.  I'm really glad I posted my original question even though it made me sound like a dick. The comments helped me realize that I was the problem and I needed to get over myself. Letting her slip away because of my judgmental ideas about people would have been a huge mistake. 

So I invited her over to my place last night and I awkwardly blurted out that I was falling in love with her and I see our relationship going somewhere. She laughed and and asked if I was asking her to go steady lol. She told me she felt the same way. Then we got a pizza and some beer and binge watched a show. And I woke up this morning with her snuggled against me.  It was perfect. 

I'm in love with this woman guys. I feel like my heart is going to explode. She's the one.  I'm going to ask her to marry me one day.

My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"My boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in Hawaii with me and his two best friends (25M and 29F). We had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25M dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

For context, my boyfriend and I have been going out since November, and it's been serious. We had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and I agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

In early June, once 25M unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29F called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. She said that if I were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. Without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in Costa Rica.

I was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so I asked my boyfriend which week in August I should be setting aside for the Hawaii trip. He let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if I were going, so he was going to go alone with her to Costa Rica. He said that we could go another week later maybe to Mexico City or something.

I was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who I had never met before. We eventually decided to do a trip together to Copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. I also asked to meet her, so that I could feel more comfortable with the trip.

We spent the 4th of July going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. My boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. I went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (I'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. They were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

This had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so I told my boyfriend that I still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that I was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. I had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and I asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

On a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which I asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. He said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. He kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and I didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

He asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. He bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and I drove the two of them to the airport.

I feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. I want to break up with him, but I don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

TL;DR - I (28F) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) and I can't get over it. I want advice on how to talk with him about this.

Just found out that my [25M] fiancee [25F] has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years [26F].,"Hi all.

I've been together with Hollie for three years and I proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. She's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. We met on a night out. We moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. I thought Hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now I'm not so sure. 

I'm best friends with a girl called Sarah. We've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). I had a crush on Sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

When I introduced Hollie and Sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever I'm around they've always been civil to each other. However, Sarah has told me that Hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. I never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

However, Sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, Hollie is actively cruel to her. Making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. I did not believe this and actually distanced myself from Sarah to protect my relationship with Hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of Sarah when I told her what Sarah had accused her of. 

I've not been that close to Sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. Sarah was there and I brought Hollie along. For some reason Sarah left early and Hollie was really upset about something. She started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

Early in the morning when Hollie was asleep I got a whatsapp voice message from Sarah which was 20 minutes long. It was a conversation between Sarah and Hollie which must have been taken yesterday. It started off OK, but Hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. She accused Sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose Sarah over her. Hollie called Sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (Sarah is an elderly care assistant). She also told her that she'd make sure I'd want nothing to do with Sarah. At this point Sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. Hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. Sarah then said goodbye to her and Hollie can be heard shouting ''You f#cking b****!''

After listening to this I was not sure what to do so I pretneded everything was normal. I made Hollie breakfast like I always do. She's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

I'm not sure what to do. I thought Hollie was everything I'd ever wanted. She was perfect. But now I'm fairly sure that everything Sarah has accused her of is true. The things she said to Sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl I fell in love with. I haven't spoke to Sarah yet, because I'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

I'm not sure if I can continue my relationship with Hollie. Sarah was my whole world once, and even now I still care deeply for her. To know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. But at the same time I was so sure that Hollie was who I was meant to be with and I'm not sure I have it in me to break her heart. 

Should I break up with Hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to I go about building bridges with Sarah?

[Update] I [34/m] found condom wrappers in our trash can. My wife [34/f] and I don't use them and I'm wondering how to approach this.,"Link to previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

Opinion on whether I should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  Ultimately I decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  She wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that I could tell.  I know her pretty well and I think I can read her reactions to things well too.  And she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as I can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  I owe her the benefit of the doubt.  And finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and I'd figure out what was going on.

I brought it up pretty casually.  Just ""Hey, I found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  We discussed it pretty calmly.  She didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that I had thought of myself.  There was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  She understood why I was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

So that's pretty much the end of it I guess.  I don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and I'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  I'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all I can do.  Sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for.",relationship_advice
I [m32] matched with my wife [f29] on Tinder...,"Big time throwaway account.

I'll start by saying that my wife and I don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

We met on Tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. We've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, I would say.

A month ago she left on a business trip for a week and I found myself downloading Tinder on a particularly lonely night. I don't even know why. I didn't have any intentions. But I did it.

I swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. It was a funny reminder of that time of my life. I deleted it and moved on.

On Monday my wife left for another business trip. Last night I once again downloaded Tinder and started swiping. Again, I had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

Then I saw her picture come up.

I say shocked for a moment. I wondered if I should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. I thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... But I read her profile... it's her. It's her now and it's her live. There's even a picture of her where I am cut out.

I decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

I swiped and we matched.

She gets back from her business trip tomorrow. I'm going to confront her then. I don't even know how this is happening. She's over 100 miles. Is a friend of her using her account??

Now I have to explain why I was on Tinder. This is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

What the hell do I do?

"(UPDATE) My husband's [M32] ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and I [F30] want it to end right now.","First, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. A lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



On the day I made my last post, my husband and I had a talk that night when I got home from work. I basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. He repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



Then I moved onto finances. I asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". I pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. I asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. When I asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



I told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on March 1st. At this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. He wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as I talked. I doubt he even heard a word I said, but I clearly stated all the other issues I had -- the Instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



After this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. For almost a week now he's slept in the basement. He basically doesn't leave the basement when I'm home unless it's to get food. Honestly, it's pathetic.



I am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. I also have a coffee date planned for Sunday with my best friend -- I am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. Because honestly, this isn't the life I want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. I am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.

My (21M) girlfriend (22F) got into a wheelchair. Don't know if we're compatible anymore.,"I know the title is horrible and everyone is going to call me an asshole but this is the truth. She got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. She's handling it like a champ. We've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person I know. Always keeps her head up even after this. And I love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. But everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. Recently I had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. There's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. I am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, I just don't really know what to write. I love her to the moon and back. But then I think, what kind of boyfriend am I if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. We were planning to get engaged next year. She's always so happy to see me and knows I've had issues dealing with the accident. She's so selfless it's not even funny. Sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested I get a FWB so I don't get frustrated. But I don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, I don't want anybody else but her.

Sorry for this mess and I'm not an English speaker. Any way this is sort of like a vent but I don't know what to do. I sincerely don't. I know I should talk to her but I don't even know what to say to her, or how.",relationship_advice
Not sure how to deal with my [37F] anti-vaxx husband [35M] since I want to get our kids vaccinated,"At first I assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  We were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

It's been 6 years. Six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

First, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

At 1 year I pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

Today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and I decided to take her to the ER.  

Thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

He said all the things I've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. He explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

I tried to explain that I agree, but I feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes I was respecting up until now.

He ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

On the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

I look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

I won't do this anymore. Although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

Can I just take them myself?  We always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

What can I say so he won't go? How can I keep this form him, or should I tell him once it's done?

Reddit I need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

Please help

Edit: for the people who are down voting::

If I was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. Help me help my children this is no different. For those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. I thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",relationship_advice

He has his Best Man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. I thought I did, too. We each have 6 people and I have 5 female bridesmaids and a ""man of honor"" which I want to be my brother. My bridesmaids think this isn't a great idea and a few are hurt I'm not choosing them instead. Here's why I want to choose my brother. 

My biological mother lost custody of me when I was 4 and I was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. I lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother's case. From 4 1/2ish to 6 I lived with my mother and it was bad. She was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 I was being adopted out. By some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and I went to live with them and was later adopted. The family had boys – the youngest was 16 when I got there. I was terrified of him when I got there, which they told me about recently (I have no recollection of that). I do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. He skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. I had eating problems, I had dental problems, I had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. He came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (I hadn't started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). He and my mom would do learning activities with me and by September I was okay to enter first grade. I used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he'd reward me with Riesens. We were very close, he didn't go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. He'd pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 I had an older brother to rely on. He eventually moved out and went to medical school (he's such a great person for that field). 

Very literally my brother helped save my life. I was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. He was a calm stable influence in my life. I credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – I would never have gone to college, I probably wouldn't have graduated high school or even lived as I was so sick. I had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before I was 8. My family doesn't look like me (I'm most likely Mexican and something else, most probably African-American) and doesn't come from where I do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. Since the others were older and out of the home I was never as close to them as I was my parents and brother. 

My thinking is, a Maid of Honor is someone really important and I cannot think of anyone else who comes close. I haven't even asked him yet but I think he'd do it. I told my parents and they said they wouldn't say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. My husband is also good with it and think it's a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified I suggested it and think it's ""creepy"". If I look back on that time, it's the happiest a person could be. Is it weird and creepy? Does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? Is it highly inappropriate?",relationship_advice
"My sister caused a scene at Mother's Day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom""","Hi guys. I am a man, 32M and I have two sisters - Carly (38F) and Melinda (26F). We went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

Melinda and I are happily married, each with three children. My older sister Carly never married. She had a fiancé that she cheated on and he left her. That was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. She has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

My mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and I both gave her an additional grandchild. So she gave a speech.

In her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked Melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

Upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister Carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""Achem!""

She then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy Mother's Day?

I explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""I am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! Just because I don't have human babies doesn't mean I'm not a f*cling mother too!""

My younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, Carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf I know right) and then stormed out.

We thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. Despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

We have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. I don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

I tried texting Carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iPhone so it's usually blue). Does this mean she blocked me?

Anyways I would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",relationship_advice
Sanity check please: boyfriend texting ex-wife for their first kiss anniversary,[removed],relationship_advice
I (f 28) walked in on my step son (8) touching my son (4),"I'm so stunned, it hasn't even sunk in.

It was early this morning. My husband was already gone for work, but I went to wake my step son up for school. He and my son slept in the same bed last night, sometimes when my son has nightmares he goes into his brother's room.

I walk in and they are awake, lying down and my stepson is just like playing with him. I can't bring myself to describe in detail. My son was giggling but as soon as he saw me, my step son burst into tears.

He got up and ran into my arms. He kept saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I told him it's okay. I didn't know what else to say, I was speechless. He kept pleading with me ""please don't tell daddy"". 

He was so distraught so I didn't have him go to school. All day he's been in his room alone crying. My son is fine, he's been watching cartoons and playing with his toys all morning.

I don't want to tell my husband on the phone, I want to wait till he comes home. But I don't know what to say to him. I'm so worried, I don't think he'll take it well. How do I tell him? What can I do? I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not angry at my step son I'm just sad and confused. I want both my son and him to be okay.",relationship_advice
[Update] My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

Update, as promised.

I was really upset the day I dropped him off and he was texting me but I wasn't responding. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I didn't want to do anything at all in the state I was in. I waited until the next day, and then I sent him a thought out text letting him know that I didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that I would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. He called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

The rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but I couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. On Thursday, I think that he realized that I was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — I told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

When he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. I was working all day, but also I still didn't want to respond. He asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. The next day, I sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why I was throwing away everything that we built. He left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why I was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that I had made up about him to his face.

I wasn't going to respond to him and I wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. So I sat down to write him this letter. It's long, so skip over if you want. I tried to call him but I started crying and told him I'd just send him an email instead. This is what it said.

""The time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. I have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and I see that we should not be together. I am sorry that I have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

From the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who I had never met that either she goes or I go on this trip, and you picked her. You didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically I was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. That's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. However, I stayed.

This is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. Here is what I understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. Nothing happened. The other thing I understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. According to what I also understand, it took a long time for 29F's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after I'm not sure how long. This is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that I was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). You did not tell me this was happening until I asked when the trip to Hawaii would be.

You purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which I have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which I repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. There is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. This makes me feel sick to my stomach.

So, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, I tell you that I want to meet this person. On my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. The first conversation that we have is one in which 29F and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. You tell me about conversations that 29F has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. I have a discussion in which I let you know that I see that and that it worries me. 

Meanwhile, I am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. I, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. I want it to work out. But each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. Your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. It is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29M, we had only been together for nine months. How long did it take before 29F's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? Much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

We go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our AirBnb for Copenhagen, we go over it when I tell you that I still feel uncomfortable and I do not feel good about the trip. Talk about repeatedly saying something! Although I ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. Surprisingly, I have no ideas either. 

Ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29F will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. You attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. This is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. This upsets me. You do not know what to do. I don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. I don't know what to do either. There is no good solution that I can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. I tell you that either I have to get over it, or I have to break up with you, and that I don't want to break up with you. But my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

She arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. After all of this lead-up, I know that you can tell how unhappy I am. I fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy I am. You leave, and when I don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope I'm okay and you're going to bed. No call.

The rest of the week was rough. My text to you was met with, essentially, ""I'm sorry you feel this way."" You tell me that I'm being unfair.

There is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. This is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. This is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29F, I guess.

In the end, all of this is to say that I have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

There have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what I can only assume are personal differences.

I cannot handle your relationship with 29F. And I suppose I could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what I want to do. I want you to have your best friend, and I want to leave. I did love you, but I am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that I'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

It seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. I am not happy in this, and I do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

There is no need for this to be mutual. I do not need your permission to break up with you.""

He wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that I would not be able to handle their relationship.

He said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

I wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

He agreed and apologized. For me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and I don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. I stand by my decision at this point.

TLDR: We broke up.",relationship_advice
I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. This may just be a problem I'm identifying in my head, and I know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

I'm an anesthesiologist in Washington, D.C. and make over 300k a year. Consequently, I live a comfortable life and, while I have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. I'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because I'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

My gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. She's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

We've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. I love spending time with her.

The issue is, I think she's uncomfortable with how much money I make. Whenever I take her on a date, I insist on paying for everything. This makes perfect sense to me, because money I spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. But she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. She'll insist on splitting the bill, or if I pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. I've told her time and time again that I'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so I'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. But she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

One time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. It was nonrefundable and she was out $300. When she was complaining to me about it, I immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, But she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

It's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, I just think it's silly that she spends money on me when I make more in a year what she'll make in five. And like I said, I'm happy to treat her.

Any thoughts on how to navigate this? I especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr I make a lot more money that GF, but she won't let me pay for things.",relationship_advice
UPDATE2: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.


I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.

On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.

I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?

My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?

I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.

They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard ""hello?"" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a Mother"" and hung up.

Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.

I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.

What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:

1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose.  Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........

Edit: 3 - My GF and I are still going to therapy about all of this.",relationship_advice
"My [20f] boyfriend [27m] did something concerning during sex and I'm not sure if he just ""didn't know"", or if it was intentional...","Together for one year and we live together. Otherwise happy and loving/respectful relationship. This post might be TMI but I don't feel comfortable seeking advice about this irl so I'm asking here how other people would feel about it.

So, we have a good sex life and I have felt happy and satisfied with it. I think he's generous in bed and cares about my own pleasure, I would NOT describe him as selfish and only caring about himself...until THIS incident. However, he's been asking me to try anal for a long time. I kept saying no and explaining my reasoning for it, which was that I was scared it would hurt and because it takes way more prep/care than PIV sex. 

[**here's the TMI part, I apologize**]He had never tried it before. He's been fingering me back there during sex and I was okay with that, but a few days ago I was laying on my stomach during sex and he stuck it in my ass without warning or asking. I was a little drunk but knew it felt off and then it just really hurt. I told him it hurt and he said to try and relax. 

I DID try to relax but it hurt really bad and I asked him like 3x to pull out before he finally did. At which point he apologized. But afterwards he did it again, and I asked him to stop again and he said to ""wait because he was about to finish"" so I allowed it to happen. I just waited til he came while in some pain and it honestly sucked.

 I'm not gonna say I was raped because I blame myself for the whole thing, but it was painful, not enjoyable, and he thinks it was great. There was no lube or anything so obviously it did not feel good for me. He wasn't rough about it but still wtf? How can you not understand that you can't just stick your dick raw into somebody's ass? It's not like a vagina which gets wet on it's own.**It makes me feel like he knew but didnt care.**

I just feel uncomfortable with the whole situation and I am not sure what to do about it. How should I have this conversation with him? What should I do about it? How would you react?",relationship_advice
"Is it weird that my gf (22f) ""tucks me in"" to bed every night? (21f)","We've lived together for over a year now, we just had our two year anniversary, and she's the love of my life, I think she's absolutely brilliant in all sense of the word. 

Our schedules are quite opposite, I wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. I always go to sleep first, I need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and I always have to be up early in the morning. She slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes I'm already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time I'm just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

I'm not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that I get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. I love it, I think it's adorable and I'm kind of a clingy girlfriend so I enjoy it a lot! I'm just wondering if anyone else does this?

Recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and I went to bed early and left them to their Netflix, and my girlfriend said she'd come tuck me in soon. I got embarrassed about it, like it's weird or something? I just don't want people to find it strange or gross, I don't know.

My (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. Is my life actually over?,"Ok so I'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. My gf who I've known for basically forever (been official since I was 14) is having my baby. Everyone especially my parents keep telling me I fucked up big and my life is over. They say I'm a loser and I'll never get anywhere in life. They say I'll never be happy again. How true is that?

I keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

I'm pretty much freaking out at this point. I have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. Obviously I don't want to be a dad BUT Im gonna be. So it is what it is. 

My parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. Since I told them she was pregnant they said since I'm making adult decisions I now have adult responsibilities. They make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. I have to buy my own food and anything I need. I have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting I'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. I have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

I desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money I had none. I was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. Gfs parents bought me a new pair since I got an infected toenail from being squished. I don't want to owe them too, JC.

Anyway. I'm leaving home once school is done in June. Gf's parents said I won't have to pay them rent as long as I help with the baby and contribute with that.

My parents say they'll sue me for the money I owe them. Can they? When I get mad they just say I'm an adult and I get adult consequences now.

"My best friend stopped me from killing myself, but has no idea","I have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. But a few days ago, I decided I was going to do it.

I was on my break at work (I'm a cleaner) and I just decided that I was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

I got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. But, then I got a text from my best friend.

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

She saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. I really want to thank her for it, but I'm kind of afraid to tell her because I don't want to upset her. I want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. How much I love her for it.

Should I (23F) tell my boyfriend (26M) about the egg?,"Pretty short and sweet. Together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. He admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. This guy's pretty good! Up until then I hadn't seen any. But I just spotted the giant one. I really didn't mean to, I haven't been trying to look for them. 

Should I tell him so he can re-hide it? Or do I take it tomorrow?

Edit: I forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because I was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

Edit update: he came to the room and I said ""What if I told you I found the giant egg?"". He laughed and told me ""Well, I got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" I jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help I will."" 

I am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! Will update then :)

I guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! I'm so touched, honestly. It kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! Will be back later once we're both home and I can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

UPDATE: firstly, a couple people I think asked so [here are the eggs in question](http://imgur.com/a/Lw1xoy3). The Reese's thing is more of a basket, but I won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. On the shelf I could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's Reese's for me in the ""egg"" xD. If you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; I took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) And ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. As for the last one, both of us swear I found it, but I must have dropped it somewhere? Under the couch or something. Idk. In the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

For everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. BUT, I mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way I've got it planned MUCH better."". Which isn't much news to me, as I've said we've discussed marriage at length (I even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). All I've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to DO IT.  I mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so I'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. Searching for the eggs was very fun!! I needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg I needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand I was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

And no, I don't think I missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. I think I really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

Now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! I'll put slips of paper in each egg I hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things I love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) So, that's all folks. No proposal, but a very happy Easter on both ends! Thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. Keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. And to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; I've been there too. If you go through my posting history you'll actually find that SO and I went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. It took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

TLDR; boyfriend hid eggs. I found eggs. Reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini Reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

Edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their SO, Easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",relationship_advice
[update]I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. How should I fix this situation?,"**Edit: Guys, I understand how petulant my daughter is behaving, but please refrain from using profanities. She's still my daughter and I'd rather not read that stuff. You can criticise her behaviour without cussing :)**

**Edit2: At the encouragement of some kind people here, I've booked flights to Hong Kong a few weeks from now. Will be using up all my accumulated leave to take a trip across China. I've always wanted to visit the country and I am looking forward to this!**

[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

So I took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

Before I even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. He seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

Anyway, I invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. As I say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

I told them that I would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that I will only do so through a trust. That I'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after I'm gone. That them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

Son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. I'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as I say it **seemed** genuine. He also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if I helped pay, to which I agreed (I'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

My daughter did not take it well, Christ. Far worse than I expected. Here I am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. I explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why I would leave it to them outright. Nope, not good enough for her. She doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300K+ GBP on travel was justified. Had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

So I told my daughter that as I'm retiring soon, perhaps I should experience the joys of travel also. Perhaps I should spend ""her"" inheritance that I've worked for my entire life on travel myself. She stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

Really proud of how my son's taken the news. Extremely disappointed in my daughter.

Genuinely considering spending ""her"" part of the inheritance on travel myself at this point.",relationship_advice
"My aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother""","A few months ago my mother killed herself. I (22m) am her only son. My parents are divorced, and I had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that I was living in Asia teaching English. I promised my mother that I would visit her when I returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before I came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. My mother told me I should visit my father first because of this.

I should also add, that at this time and the past few years, I was very, VERY depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. I really wanted to be at my home where I felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. When I got home, my grandfather passed away on the day I arrived, and I was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so I stayed with my father for a few weeks.

Later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. I debated visiting her at that time, but I wasn't sure I would be feeling well enough to travel again. My grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but I told her I would have to think about if I can come then. Eventually I decided that I would visit them at the same time as my mother.

The night I arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. That night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. I was driving home from the airport at that time. I remember that night so vividly as I could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  My aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. I noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. They seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

After about a week I returned to my father's home and stayed there. I was an emotional mess for the following month. I had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. Eventually I began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" I was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. They accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. They even insulted my father. Relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but I have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. I know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. Especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

Today I received an email from my aunt that told me that I would have to go to court. It simply stated that I should call this lawyer. I am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. It's so difficult for me to think clearly, and I can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. Any advice would be appreciated. I feel like I missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify, that I don't know the actual legal accusation. She accused me of those horrible things while on the phone.

Edit 2:  One comment mentioned it, but I just want to say that I don't believe they are after money. They genuinely believe I am a horrible person, and a horrible son, so they wish to hurt me.

Edit 3: Thank you for all the responses! I have read all of them, and they gave me a lot of confidence to keep moving forward. I did take the advice to post on r/legaladvice. So I'll update everyone (hopefully soon) to how this situation unfolds. Thanks again!",relationship_advice
My wife (29F) is encouraging me (31M) to have an affair?,"Wife and I have been married for 5 years. I think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. I think she thought the same. However, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while I was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

Apparently ""Fernando and Sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! When he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what I'm getting from it.

So I told her flatly that I don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. Case closed I thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

I'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear I'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! She keeps going on and on about her work friend Fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

SO at this point I'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? She's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but I'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" It's concerning.

Straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""Fernando's Sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... I'm like... lost for words right now. How do I make it clear I don't want to ahve sex with someone else and I believe in monogamous relationships.

We have 2 kids.",relationship_advice
Am I in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?,"Context. Happened a few days ago. Me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). We were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. Me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

After awhile his friend came back alone. My boyfriend got up which woke me up. I was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. My boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. I was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. I panicked and didn't know what to do. Was I suppose to jump up and let them know I was listening? Freak out? (I have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). I froze and he lifted up the covers I was under. Edit: I was naked 

I confronted him the next day but he says I wanted him to see me because I didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and I should be too so we can let it go.

Am I an asshole? Can I not be upset because I didn't stop it?

Update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. I've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. I thought I was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as I was making it since I wasn't touched or anything. I'd like to make an update after I talk with him again. When you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? Im new to this.

To everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. I was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. I wasn't sure at first but I know I didn't do anything wrong. 

I'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. It's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

MORE INFO: I am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. I know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how I went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

[UPDATE] 1 year later- I [28F] gave my boyfriend [28M] an engagement ultimatum and I might be regretting it,"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but I had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (I've known that I want to marry him for about 2 years, so I've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). I was getting frustrated, (I would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so I told him in September that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or I was going to move out.

&#x200B;

Update #1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: Written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. His asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in December 2018 if I visited his family in their home in September and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. His reasoning was that I had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (I had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). I was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200B;

Now, on to the current update:

***March 2018***: I couldn't go through with the ultimatum. I was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. But when push came to shove, I couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. I decided that I loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that I had created. I also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in December. I felt I was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because I wouldn't wait another few months. As a compromise, he said we could get a cat (I had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. On 3/31, the day I was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200B;

***April-September 2018***: My boyfriend and I spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. We both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. I got a therapist and started working on myself. I picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. I think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. Also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. I'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. By the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. He also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200B;

***September 2018- visiting his family***: As I promised him, I went to visit his parents in their home in September. As I mentioned in the previous post, he is Chinese-American (and I'm white), so I studied up on my basic Chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. It was a great trip, and I genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. I left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). I asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in December would be ""too fast."" That seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. He also told me I needed to learn Chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect English but prefer Chinese when they are with family), so I started doing Rosetta Stone.

&#x200B;

***October-December 2018***: Around November, I started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. He was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. For instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by December because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). Another time, he freaked out that I have student loans (most people in my profession do, and I have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. Luckily I already have this spreadsheet, which I showed him, and he calmed down.

In the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. Although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because I was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. I worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. I also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- I stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as I had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). We spent Christmas together for the first time this year, and I really thought he would propose then. But he didn't, and I didn't bring it up or pout about it. He visited his family for New Years and I was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200B;

***January 2019:*** I accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. I was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and I tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. I was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. It's now to the point that I equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that I shouldn't have. I realize I've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. But a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. First, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if I stay onboard long term. However, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (I am actually okay with it for the most part). He also has given a hard NO to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). I started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

Then, this weekend I went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. Also, I want to have kids, that's the main reason I am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). So yesterday, I was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and I had this ""Aha!"" moment where I realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. There's no shame in having my own wants. And at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (No marriage, we can't stay in the city where I have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but I've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with HIS desires. So I'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. Also I am willing to hear all the ""I told you so'"" from everyone who said I needed to leave this guy in March when I said I would. I totally deserve it. Thanks for reading!

&#x200B;

***UPDATE***: Wow, thank you Reddit for the super thoughtful replies! I read each one (so far)! 

I spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. I started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. He brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. That we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that I want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes I make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. He worries about  the fact that I get a lot of Amazon packages and he doesn't know what I am buying (showed him my Amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). Also this is all on my credit card (which I comfortably pay off each month) so I don't think I need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. He also doesn't like that I'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). Also, since it came up a lot in the comments, I wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

However, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. I was pretty pissed and told him I wished he told me this a year ago so I could have moved on. He basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. So I told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. He's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but I'm remaining gently firm here.",relationship_advice
Girlfriend (20F) and her friend (20F) 'tested' to see if I (20M) I would cheat.,"Errr I really don't know how to feel. Though I'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. My gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so I did. She wasn't there yet, but her friend was. We chatted for a while and she started being playful, but I brushed it off. Playful turned into flirting and I felt super awkward. Before I got up she kissed me and I left right after that and called my gf. I explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. I couldn't believe it tbh, I thought she was joking at first. First she was mad that I 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much I could do. And I don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? I've never heard of someone setting up their SO and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

Where do I go from here. She has apologized (half-assed that is) but I kinda don't want to speak to her right now. We're together for 6 months.",relationship_advice
"My husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn't tell me.","Okay, this is not a shitpost. I wish it was. I'm deeply disturbed. 

The other night after sex, as my husband and I were getting up and dressed, I asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. He was on his way out of the room, and said sure. He wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. We weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

As I walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

I don't know what came over me, but I got this sixth sense, I don't know how else to describe it. Maybe it was his shiteating grin, but I flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

He looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second I thought maybe I was being an idiot. 

He then says, how did you know?!?!

I was furious but it was such a strange situation so I just dumped it out and brushed it off. I didn't know what else to do. 

The next day I asked him about it, and I asked why he did it. He said, I don't know.  

I told him that it kind of made me upset, like I can't trust him to get me a glass of water. It hurt my feelings. He immediately got defensive. 

We got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. I said, so what? Do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

He said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

I don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way I phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. But, like wtf?

I don't know what to think. 

Am I overreacting?

EDIT:

For those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. He's 34, I'm 32. 

Honestly I didn't expect for this to blow up. I wrote a quick post and went to bed.

Thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, I'm trying to respond to as much as I can. 

Here's my takeaway: 

Some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

But here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. I asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. No harm done! That he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. He just did. 

So to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

After thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. To those asking, sure we just had sex and yes I suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. He violated boundaries and I feel upset about that.

UPDATE:

Whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

I'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",relationship_advice

So it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. And just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). I tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that I can't lie to her. At that point i think my face turned white and I legit had no idea what to even do or say.

I was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows. I also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so I can't say someone ratted me out. She said that it was the way I looked at her. I never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and I know there's not even a chance. But now that I know she knows, what do I do?

Should I (24M) leave my gf (24F) over her weight?,"Hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. Ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and I love her to bits. She is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200B;

She has gained alot of weight and is now obese. I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200B;

It doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.

&#x200B;

Theres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200B;

You can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200B;

Edit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.

I am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. If I dont see any improvment then I know there is no hope and will leave her. Thanks again you lovely people, I will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200B;

Another Edit: I cannot reply to all your comments but I have read most of them! Some of your stories have been great to read. A quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. She took it really well. To all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, I dont know because she would never tell me her weight. I really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but I shall know in a few months. I will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",relationship_advice
My Roommate's(21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21 F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.,"TLDR: MY roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment 

Backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. I was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. Recently, MY PARENTS got ME an apartment and pay  RENT every month. So pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

Over the past few months when we come home from class,  we have walked in on
1. Her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. Her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. HER MOM CLEANING MY FUCKING CLOSET and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. Her Mom and dad chillin at the apartment Friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

I just can't deal anymore. I told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said I'm overreacting. Am I overreacting? Should I tell my parents?

I have lost my mind. Literally. Udhdudbdu helpppp.

Edit 2: Imma tell my parents about it. I just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

Mini update: I took out edit 1 to shorten the post. I told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying I can put a lock on my bedroom door. Me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. Her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. She doesn't look too happy. I'll update you all again when I tell my parents.

Edit: sorry for all the edits but I think I need to clarify something. The reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. He said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

I just texted her that she can enjoy her vacation without worrying about me at home because we're over. Idk what her response will be but I'm done, that's fucking disrespectful to sleep over with some random guy even if they didn't do anything, which I doubt. Fuck I'm over it

I (30f) have just been diagnosed with an illness and am struggling to forgive my husband (39m) for not believing me.,"We have been together for 5 years, throughout those 5 years (and about 3 years before I met him) I have had numerous medical issues that I have had to deal with. Nothing life threatening but certainly life affecting.

Sporadically occurring symptoms have included chronic muscle and joint pain to the point I struggled to get out of bed, skin infections, serious fatigue, hair loss and frequent cold/flu like viruses. 

At first he was really understanding, would comfort me and sympathise with how doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong but for the last year and a half he has started suggesting it's in my head or I'm exaggerating the symptoms.  This hurt so badly because doctors for that last several years have basically said the same thing. I was prescribed pain killers, told I was 'just' depressed and given AD's, or just straight up dismissed. So I stopped bothering. 

Then about two months ago I had to go get a script filled and she was so lovely that I started talking about some of this stuff. She ordered a bunch of tests and through intensive questioning and reviewing of my medical history I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. 

Thankfully it's something that with appropriate medical care and treatment it can be managed and I'm now starting to feel better. My husband has profusely apologised and has been really supportive but I still feel hurt and kind of betrayed that he didn't believe that I knew there was something wrong. He saw the pain I was in but believed I was putting it on.

We've spoken about it but it still hurts, I don't know how to move on.",relationship_advice
Update - My (21M) girlfriend (22F) got into a wheelchair. Don't know if we're compatible anymore,"First off, wow. Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day. Thanks.

Update: My (21M) girlfriend (21F) REALLY wants anal. I dont.,"Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnl77j/my_21_m_girlfriend_21_f_really_wants_anal_i_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So, I tried it. I thought that maybe I was being too close minded and so I went for it. It went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. But here's the bad part.

She didnt like it at all. Even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. This would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. She says that I sabotaged it because I didnt want to do it. But i didnt. I did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. She was really the director here. But somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

Im pretty livid about this. I went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. And I feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. It feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes I ruined it on purpose. We had a fight over this and we broke up. Thanks for the advice to those who participated in the last post.",relationship_advice
I (22 F) got left at the alter a week ago yesterday. Now my ex fiance (26 M) wants to to apologize in person.,"He says he is gay and in love with his best friend. I had NO clue whatsoever. 

He waited until our wedding day to leave me a note in my hotel room that contained this information. 

I am sad, angry, and confused. 

I wish he had told me long before the day of the ceremony and spared me the extreme pity and humiliation I went through that day. 

Now he wants to meet in person to apologize and say goodbye. 

Should I go?",relationship_advice
My (21f) boyfriend (22m) said he wouldn't want to date me if I had slept with as many people as him.,"I'm not to sure how this was brought up but last night we were laying in bed when he said that if I had had slept with as many people as him (roughly 30) then he wouldn't have wanted to date me. He also said that it's a turn off that I slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

He said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

I find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. I'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

Edit: for those of you judging the amount of partner he has had in the past, your view is just as bad as his.

Update/edit?: This really got a lot more attention then i was expecting and he has now also seen this post.  I really appreciate everyone's advice but I dont think am ready to make a rash decision just yet (much to the annoyance of most people on this thread). I've taken on bored some of the advice being said and think that I need to sit down and have proper conversations with him before i decide if i should continue this or not. I think I should hear him out when I have calmed down a bit and am less angry to give him a chance to explain his point of view.",relationship_advice
How do I (34M) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34F) that has no life skills?,"Genders are actually reversed, he knows I've been browsing this sub lately and I'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

I'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. He has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. He never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. It's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. None of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

I feel like a bad person, but I don't see a future together that I want. I just wish I'd come to this realization sooner.

We have no kids, only 3 cats. We're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). Only thing I can think of is he's on the bank account, but I doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. I'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... We've paid off about 40k of it. Or technically, I have.

He's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and I worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. I still care very much for him, but I can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

How do I break up? I don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, I want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

Update : I told him I wanted to break up. Said this wasn't the life I wanted, and that I gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. I'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this Thurs to work on any sticking points.

Then left the house. He wants to know why now, why can't I give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. I had to leave, or I'm going to start saying things I regret or break down. Not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so I won't be bored (what can i say, I'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

I'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

Update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. I lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

I didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. I had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, I'm going to leave it up. Its not that I'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. I knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). I'll try to post other updates too. I appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. Sorry if I don't have time to reply to everyone.

And if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close I can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. I'd rather you didn't read this.

Update #3 : He's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. No logistics have been discussed except it sounds like I won't see him for a bit. I've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. Have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. They all heard from him first, except his sister who I gave a heads up to (with no details). It's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I want these people to be there for him when I'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

I'm not sure I should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. Gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. Not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

I'm tired and think I can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as I sorted this all out. Will try to respond to questions later.

Update #4 : I really appreciate all the support, it's more than I can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when I need it. And I've needed a lot of it.

He's back and staying in a separate room for now. This is his home too, I'm not going to force him out the first night when I've already ruined his life. I planned to keep my distance, but I'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes I sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. He knows he fucked up. I'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him I want it done by the end of the month. If he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

Also I'm seeing a lot of questions about if I'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man I needed. I don't know. I'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, I'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when I'm ready to go looking again. I know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. He's been my best friend for 16 years, and I still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. We grew up together and been through a lot. I don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and I changed. I'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and I'm the one that changed to realize I was not ok with it anymore too.

And to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. Maybe for some it is, but that's not who I am. I want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. And is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. This has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. I want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone I have to fight and drag along.

Thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. I'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. Maybe I'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

Update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than I thought. I thought my tears would be done by now. The optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person I need. I miss and love him so much. But I've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. The support here keeps me going, I can't tell you all how much I appreciate it. It's going to be a rough few weeks, but I can do this.  I keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

Like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. I feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

The lack of support for me has been hard. Only his mom has asked how I've been, and wanted my side. I think she understands. We were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. I knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. I'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. But I still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people I know. Maybe I'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

He's I think out of the house for good now. Not sure, but I told him either he goes, or I find a temp apartment this week. He left while I was sleeping and hasn't been back. I haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. He's a good guy, I wish I had said a better goodbye. Given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. I know it's better this way, I can't be the one there for him now. It hurts, but I know it's for the best

Update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and I didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. I consider that progress. Some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. Each time it happens, I try to identify the cause. Usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt I've caused someone. It's hard not to miss him, but I feel a lightness about being free. And I'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. Bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. I'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment Thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

I've barely seen or talked to him since I broke it off. I don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. I said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it Thursday. I really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. Misses him so much, not eating much. She's 20lbs, and loves food. He stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that I just gave her. I try to show her extra love, but I can tell she misses him. And he probably misses her.

I've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. And writing in a private diary document. It's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. For example, if I start thinking maybe I could have tried another ultimatum, I can just go back and re-read what happened the first time I gave one. Or if I get to feeling I could have tried harder, I can go back and read all the things I did try over the past year. Writing it out and talking to others really does help.

Caught my girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"My girlfriend and I have a good sense of humor, we like to play around and everything. So she caught me jerking off like a month ago, she thought it was hilarious and kept teasing me about it and asking me what I was thinking about and all that stuff. It's fine, it was embarrassing for 5 minutes but she wasn't mad or weirded out so that helped. I asked her if she masturbated and she said she never did and that she didn't need to and she didn't like it.

Last week, I came home a bit early unexpectedly and she was in our bed giving herself an interesting massage. I heard her before I saw her so I came in and surprised her and I was teasing her a bit since she said she never did it and she just started crying and told me to leave. Obviously I felt like shit and apologized but she still made me go. I came back home a couple hours later and she was still upset. To this day, she is still upset. I didn't mention it again, but she's acting different. She just seems sulky and withdrawn and not interested in sex. I don't know how to bring it up without making her cry again. I had no idea she was gonna react like that, she was making fun of me for weeks, I thought she could take a joke 

And I feel dumb for not knowing that she masturbated earlier on, we've been together for 4 years and I just found out. I guess she's really good at hiding secrets

Wife asking me to get circumcised - advice?,"Hi guys!

My wife and I have been married 2 years, 4 together total.

I grew up in Europe and circumcision is extremely rare there. Apparently it is much more common in the US.

All her past BF were circumcised and she says she prefers it that way.

She stopped giving my oral sex once we got married and she says it's because she doesn't like doing it for me because of how I am not snipped.

She also calls it anteater penis and makes increasingly disgusted faces when we have sex.

I am willing to do this in order to make her happy but I just want to know you're all thoughts about this.

TL;DR: wife doesn't like my ""anteater"" dick as she calls it so she wants me to get circumcised.

I'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years. We have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. It's no secret that I am cranky when I am tired, and especially when I'm awakened from sleeping. We joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

Last night, I went to bed at 10. He stayed up, which was fine. He even took the baby downstairs with him so I could get some better quality rest. All good. 

Just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (Baby sleeps in our room.) I don't remember any of this, but He says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. Baby started crying. I got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" And went back to sleep. 

This morning I woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. I noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. Feeling very well rested, I told my husband I felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. He said yes. I asked why, and he told me I yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

I remembered none of this. Once he told me the details, I have a vague recollection of what happened. 

I feel really guilty about this.  Simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. How do I change this behavior?

EDIT: thank you all so much for all the posts and advice. When Hubby got home, I gave him a big hug and told him I was really sorry.  I told him I really wanted to work on it, and read the list of ideas that you guys helped me generate; thank you so much. We had dinner, I put the older two to bed; he took the baby. After the boys were down, I planned to continue the convo (and see where the one-on-one Time leads us), but he is sound asleep with the baby!  I'm going to let him get that much-needed rest. Will do some research online and see what kind of help there is available for me. Thanks again.",relationship_advice
"I [M26] recently found out my ""Step-Father"" [M48] who just married my mother 2 years ago is currently having a sexual relationship with my wife of 4 years [F28] behind my back and has been since late summer or maybe even before that. What am I supposed to do? Should I tell my mother?","I'm sorry if this is a little much. I've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

My wife and I have been married for 4 years. We argue sometimes over little things but I love her with all my heart. There's never been anything wrong until now. I thought we were happy, I always treated her right and got listened to her. I took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. She doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so I gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because I wanted her to be great. She goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

I'm not close to my mother at all but I see her from time to time. Recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. She was horrible to me growing up but I tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. She has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. She recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him X. My mother invites me and my wife and It's the first time they all meet. Probably 4th time I've met him since they married fairly quickly. He seemed.. Okay. Just really didn't like his vibe too much. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

Last year, X asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. My wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, I agreed. I thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. X and my wife really hit it off and I'm not very good with construction/renovation related things I ended up going out with my Mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. It was weird but we tried. My wife stayed behind and helped X remodel. Her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than I about how to help fix the house up.  They seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when I wasn't around and super animated conversations but I didn't think much of it because I assumed she was just being nice to my new ""Step Father."" I trusted my wife. 

She started going back over to my mother's house to help X out afterwards. They live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. I noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. She kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since I wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. It was like once or twice a week. This started happening early this year. When the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which I didn't mind. I guess that makes me stupid. When her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. She seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. I tried to go with her to my Mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and I didn't really like X's humor/mannerisms. I didn't mind, I worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

A few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. I always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. She was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. It does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. I didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. I tapped her screen to see what it was and I recognized the number. It was X's. He sent multiple MMS messages with his face and nude pics of himself. There were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. Just alot of words I haven't processed yet. I took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know I saw. I really wish I didn't. I really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. There are MONTHS of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, I took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the Midwest. He's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. She doesn't know I'm leaving in Jan which is when our lease is up. I told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. I came back and she didn't seem any different. Our anniversary is the day before Christmas Eve.  I haven't told my mother, not sure how or if I want to. I haven't told anyone except you, reddit. I want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

It's been a while but I still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. I feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. I already feel broken and empty. I left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. I thought she was happy. We have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time I found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. I need some time to think and I need to know how to fix this with my wife? How do I tell my mother? I love my wife with everything she's all I have I gave her everything these last 4+ years. I cant just  divorce, Im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

I know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but I don't think i can lay next to her anymore. I've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. I'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. She's already called me 3 times and I'm just exhausted emotionally. It hurts ignoring her calls. I'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if I have the time. Im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but I hope you have advice.

(update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

It all came to a head last night.  She just came out and asked me if I did not love her anymore and all that I could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

This started a larger conversation that I won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that I would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that I would have felt like I could have worked on it.  I would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  But to know that I was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something I thought I could get over any time soon or if I ever could for that matter.

I was even honest and said that if it was just a ONS she had or some random guy who was just huge I might be able to get past that.  But knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when I met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than I could handle.

She kept trying to tell me how much better I was at everything else and that I should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  I told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes I needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that I can never be.

I tried my best to be gentle, I tried to take all of the blame of stating that I knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who I am.  

BTW I'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

This is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  I am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  Everybody's Christmas is ruined.  We had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

This alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am I going to say is the reason why we are not together?  She didn't cheat and if I say that I felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  It's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

In the end I feel like a massive failure.  I feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and I feel like a failure because I wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

She has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially I said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  We can talk about every single thing and I can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who I wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what I do I will never be as good as her ex.  I just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

But because she legitimately seems heartbroken I agreed to go.  But that does  not mean I will keep going.  

Today I moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until I can get a place for myself.  She has been with her sister all day.  

I feel like shit.  

Thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  I honestly have tried to read everything even if I didn't reply to very many.

The bitch of all of this is that I still love her.  There is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

EDIT:  Well once again I posted this and then went away for awhile.  I went with my friend to see Mortal Engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so I started reading awhile ago.  It is going to take me forever to read and once again I don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  But thank all of you for reading and responding.

EDIT 2:  I guess I do want to share one thing I spoke with her about.  When we were having our very long conversation I presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  I know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  So I put the scenario to her like this.  I said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend Tim and you heard this.  ""Jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way Tiffany did""  ""But its not Jill's fault Tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person I've ever known and Jill just isn't as smart"".  Then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""I love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""Nobody makes a sandwich like you do and I think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
At first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   She ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  I then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw I would never say to anyone out loud about anyone I loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
EDIT 3:  If anyone even reads this I want to add one last thing.  People have been telling me what a whiny bitch I am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because I can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  Not going to lie and say I'm thrilled with it but I'm not dumb enough to think I have a giant magic wand or anything.  I had grown up believing what I now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  Some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  But even with that ultimately I might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  But hearing that no matter what I did, how much I loved her or any other thing that I was NEVER going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  Yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if I hadn't heard that I would never be the lover I think I might have been okay.  Well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  Yes I overvalue sex.  I get that.  Yes it is very important to me and well frankly I want to be wanted as much as I want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  Yes I know whoever I date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  But I would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later. ",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: I (27M) just learned my wife (27F) lied about her past, including being sexually assaulted by my best friend.","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i\_27m\_just\_learned\_my\_wife\_27f\_lied\_about\_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i_27m_just_learned_my_wife_27f_lied_about_her/)

&#x200B;

Wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  As expected I received a ton of different opinions, and I thank you all.  However some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  Specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  It helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200B;

I had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that I had found and that bothered me.   
 I told her I just wanted the truth, and that I wasn't angry.  She explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that F took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  She was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  She was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  When F finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  She had told F to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  She also pointed out that once F left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  They went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  There were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with F was available).

&#x200B;

I know some of you wanted me to talk to F.  But I have no desire to, and I definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  There was plenty of texts from F to W lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  He lied to her saying I was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told W countless times she never had a chance with me.  W had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200B;

My wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion I'm sticking by her side.  We discussed our other relationship issues too.  Like I said, we had been struggling recently.  But the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  Not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  She told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  She was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  She wasn't mad that I looked through her messages, she even said I'm welcome to look.  But she promised she has nothing to hide.  Whether you agree or disagree with me, I married this woman for a reason.  And while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, I believe we are on the right path.

My girlfriend won't sleep with me because she's afraid to get pregnant..,"To clarify, I don't mean sex, when I say ""sleep with me"", I literally mean she won't lay in the same bed as me because she's afraid to get pregnant. We are both 18 in college and, tonight, she was spending the night in my dorm after watching ""A Quiet Place"". We both laid down and she was adamant that her or I sleep on the floor. So, I slept on the floor, and she STILL put her pants on because ""oh your semen can end up in there"". This is the same girl that was worried after we made out (in full clothing) that she was pregnant. This is so frustrating and I've had to have the birds and the bees talk with her AND SHE'S STILL PULLING THIS SHIT. I tried laying in the bed and she started complaining and now, somehow, we are both on the floor, mad. What do I do?",relationship_advice
Muslim guy [22M] whom I [22F] multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity,"We have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

During the first year of uni, he has asked me out and I declined. During the years, I have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. I guess, in total, I had to decline him about 10 times or so.

However, during last summer I had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how I am). We have talked a little, and that's all. Soon after I had stumbled upon him near my house. I confronted him again, he denied following me. After that I told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

It all has been silent until last month. Two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if I have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. She didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. He did not reply.

Today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

I lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. He denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. I have ranted and once again blocked him.

However, I do not believe this is the end. I am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. I mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

He never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

What am I to do?

Update 10/07: I would like to thank everyone for your replies. A lot of helpful advice was given, I really appreciate it. The situation doesn't seem so unmanageable as before.

"Every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new Xmas decorations she just throws away after New Years. She promised me last year was the last but I just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. I'm disgusted. What do I do here? (Both 34, two kids)","Wife and I have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. Wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. I've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during Xmas. 

I don't mind her being generous to friends and family. It brings her joy and I appreciate that. But what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. Every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of Christmas decorations. Everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. Every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

To best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. She will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. Then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. Then she'll see one at Walmart which features lighting McQueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. So we'll have 10 new stockings for Xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on January 2nd. The rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. Replace stockings with any other Xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

Last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about April on her xmas purchases. I told her enough was enough and frankly I'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. We went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. She agreed.

However I was getting ready for work (I work extra Saturday shifts in Novmeber and December to afford the holidays, another post I guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new Xmas decorations hidden in the garage. I would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. I'm so disgusted I can hardly see straight. 

I'm up at 4:30 on a Saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. I feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

What do I do here? Sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here. 


edit: my meter is a little off but this asshole is trying to troll me right?

Let's see... HER problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. HEY! YOU live there too. YOU get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for YOUR friends and YOUR family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? You bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. But you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. Hey, I've got an idea, Mr. Man. GET ON YOUR TINY SNOWFLAKE FEET AND PUT THE FUCKING DECORATIONS AWAY. Then there they are, next year. Her? She's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. Or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [34M] wife [28F] wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend,"[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bev4g9/my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby_after_her/)

Hi all!

Wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than I expected. First of all, I want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. It means a lot.

Now, onto the update.

For Easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a BBQ at her sister's. Not wanting her family to see any tension, I saw this as a chance for her to HAVE to speak to me. As we're getting ready for church, I tell her that we need to talk about everything now. She agreed and sat down with me.

I did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). She agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

Also, I know a lot of you suggested that I get a paternity test. I know that I'm 100% the father. I didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. I thought it out, but, I still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. She adamantly said no. She had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. She tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. She described him as not being a good person at all.

She apologized for making me feel that way.

I told her that I understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. But, I had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

She started to get choked up and was shaking. I told her that she could tell me. 

She confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. Also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

She also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. She wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. She talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. Now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. She actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. She doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. She feels gutted. 

Regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. We're the best things that has ever happened to her.

Anxiety also runs in my wife's family. My wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. It's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

After discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  She has her first appointment this week.

TLDR: Wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. She keeps thinking about how he died. Wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. She's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. Wife will go into therapy this week.",relationship_advice
I (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.,"I don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where I'm from, so I'll be kinda vague.

&#x200B;

I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. It wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. It's home. Now that I'm at a huge university in my city, I've met people from all types of backgrounds. Of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. He's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. But I was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. We really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200B;

In my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/GPA. That applies from elementary school and until the end of College. College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount. Finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. The good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

It's like, in my HOOD hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. I think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. It's super lowkey.

I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. He never seemed scared or judgemental. When we walked in, I was getting out my school ID. I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. He laughed. I asked him what was so funny.

He said ""They shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

He says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. I told him that IS where I live. It's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

This started a huge argument.

I asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. I have 3. They were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. It's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. My mom goes to a new funeral every week. Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now. My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. That there's ""nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". And that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". That this is why people get dependant on welfare.

At this point I told him I was done. I didn't want to debate, I didn't want to talk him. Not then, not ever again. We just went out separate ways. I broke up with him as soon as I got home.

He thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. That we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. I told him, yes the fuck we are. He's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  I think I may have overreacted with the block, but I want him to leave me alone. I don't want to work it out.

All my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

I'm not saying I HAVE to be with someone who's from my hood. But I have to be with someone who at least gets it. Especially when ""it"" has shaped who I am today. Idk what kind of person I am, but I think I might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. That ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

Edit: I'm sorry I wasn't clear. Should I let him reach out to me? I don't want to get back together, but should I unblock him and talk it out. I'm worried that I'll fold and we might get back together. I've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. I'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **I didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. But our core values don't align. What he said and did disgusted me. In the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

Edit: Guys I did not make it out the hood at 19, I still live there lmao. I'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day I can get my whole family out.

My boyfriend choked me,"We went to a concert last night. And had some drinks. His mood turned toward the end of the evening and seemed grumpy. I kept asking why he was mad at me and he wouldn't tell me. He kept calling me a bitch and pulled my hair while I was walking in front of him to the car. On the way home he wouldn't say one word to me. When we got inside his apartment I said ""please talk to me. Why are you made at me? I'm sorry. Please don't be angry."" He just snapped and pushed me to the couch and started choking me. I was so shocked. He stared right in my eyes while he did it. I couldn't think of what to do so I slapped him. I just wanted him to let me breathe. Then he slapped me back and started choking me again. I didn't pass out but my vision was going black. He got off me and left the room. I grabbed my stuff and ran, going to my house. The next day he didn't apologize he said ""I didn't want to hurt you but you were acting up last night. I love you, but you brought that side out of me."" ....... I don't know what I should do?! I'm so confused. He has never done this before. Maybe he was just really drunk. ",relationship_advice
[UPDATE 2]: My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"Hey everyone, Another update, probably my last one on this story:

First of all, I would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so I am very grateful. 

I have received some pretty messed up private messages, and I wanted to let you guys know because I don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: Date Rapist Here: Hey I just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. I knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(I can provide screenshots if necessary) 

As for how it unfolded: I gave my boyfriend my phone to text S if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. He made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that I was very upset about what had happened, that I needed an explanation and that I was telling my bf everything. His answer was ""How could you not know I have always liked you? I thought you liked me too."" ""I am sorry I went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""Anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" Needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. He then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, I saw you put something in it."" He then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

My boyfriend called him and told him that I had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. He also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. I don't know what is going to come of that. 

Honestly, I just don't want to see him again now. The police has my report and I hope he never tries that again but I can't do much more. 

Thank you again for the support.",relationship_advice
Forced to quit diet,"So my gf(31) and me (38) started a keto diet 7 weeks ago. We're both obese. It did work for me, lost 30 pounds since April 1st, feeling good and with energy, no more anxiety and started walking now I'm running on a daily basis.
But it is not working for her. She has lost only a few pounds, looks the same and is hungry all the time. Problem is she is so frustrated that wants to quit, but also told me it was unfair and is trying to force me to quit too. I tried to tell her it was unfair too and selfish, but she just got more angry. This is working for me, I've been obese for 20 years and I feel now like never before. I don't want to break up but she is been irrational. What should I do? Thanks in advance.

Edit- I never expected this level of reaction and the amount of advise you're all giving me. THANK YOU! I'll talk to her, you people have given me great ideas for what to do next. I do understand there are more issues behind her attitude, I will be more supportive of her but will continue exercising. Thank you, thank you all.",relationship_advice
"I [17/M] glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend [17/F] going though all her messages, and I saw hearts and ""I love you"" to her best guy friend.","Is it normal, or am I just overanalyzing things. She text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. Here's the kicker though. He calls her cutie. He's told me in person that he's interested in her. He calls her cutie over text. Now, obviously I can't just outright tell her anything, Because then she'll know I caught a glance. She said I love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so I guess it's normal. I'm just trying to get some other opinions.

Edit One: Wow, thanks everyone, seriously. I talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. She was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. I told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. She agreed with me, I think. I told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""I love you"" thing. She has some extracurriculars, so I won't hear from her until around 4:45. Thanks everyone, so much. I'll let you all know what went down.

Edit Two: Nothing yet from her, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. If I don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

Edit Three: So, being 17, I have a momma to talk to. So, that's exactly what I did. I went driving with her, I've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and I both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. However, come Monday, I will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. Obviously, I won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. Thank you all for the continual support, I love you all.

Edit Four: Alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. He called me, and apologized. He didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. He said ""It may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. The girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. Thank you all, even the ""You're 17 shut up fag"" comments. I love you all unconditionally. Night y'all.",relationship_advice
My wife (F30) told me that she cheated on me (M28) and I honestly don't know what to do,"We have been married for over 5 and a half years. I love her so much. We finally got our own place on December 2018 and things were looking up for us. These 5 years were so magical and I always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that I would marry her again.

This past Tuesday, my lead told us that we can VTO  (Volunteer Time Off. I work night shift) So my co worker gave me a ride home. (My wife and I share a car). When he dropped me off, I noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. I thought that she parked somewhere else.

As soon as I went inside, I went to our bedroom so that I can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that I am home. The plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

She wasn't in the room. She wasn't home. So I called her and asked her where she was. When she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

My heart broke because I had a feeling of what was going on. She made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. I gave her the benefit of the doubt.

So I was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. She sat on the bed and I asked her if she was okay. She wouldn't answer and began to cry. Then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. She said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

I am sad. I honestly thought this would never happen to me. I don't know what to do. We had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. We agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, I am strongly considering in divorcing her. I can't even look at her anymore. The thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. She wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

What should I do? Am I overreacting?  I honestly thought of killing myself. I am so sad. She was my everything.

TLDR;   Wife confessed to cheating. I am so sad. Thinking of killing myself.  What do I do?

Thank you

Edit to say: Just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) I am so surprised for the support! <3

Thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. I still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  I forgive her. Time will heal this pain and honestly, I love her too much to end this.  We have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. I honestly can't imagine being with another person.  She is truly sorry that she cheated on me. Most wont agree with this, but I will give her another chance and see where this goes.

And no, I wont kill myself. I promise.  I really appreciate your concerns and replies. It makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. Take care everyone and I'll update as time goes on.. <3

\*\*\*UPDATE 09/13:\*\*\*

I have been reading the comments. I understand that to most it is stupid that I am still with her. I understand. Trust me. We have been talking a lot. She is truly sorry and I forgive her. I put her mistake behind me and I am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  We plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. The reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (We will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200B;

We are working this out. We are still living together. We are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. Honestly, it has been going well. Things are looking up because soon, I will be transferring to Day shift so that I can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that I have been longing for. I still want her in my life and I don't see divorce. We will work this out.

Again, Thank you all for helping me in my time of need. I am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. It helps. Ill update as time goes on. <3",relationship_advice
Am i being a prick?,"Basically my SO (26f) is unemployed and has begun spending £80 a week renting a horse. Her total income is about £130 a week in benefits including child maintenance and we obviously have bills to pay for and rent. I didn't think it was really an option to spend that much money so she could see a horse from time to time but she feels it's completely justified. She's quick to criticise my choice to go out for some drinks maybe once every month or two and I do work full time. For the sake of peace I've told her I'm happy with her decision as long as she can continue contributing towards rent (£35 a week for her) but she's really pissed off that I insisted she explain how she's going to be able to afford it. What do you think, was I an asshole to question her choice?",relationship_advice

tldr: dad thought I wasnt his kid and left me. Now, it turns out I am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. But it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so I dont really want to be his pal. Family says I'll regret not giving him a chance, and I came to the internet for perspective.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice, but I decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and I'll be standing my ground.

I've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying I'm a crazy teen and I'll regret it. But grandpa made a point that I need to stop trying to decide how I'll feel in the future. Cause truth is you can never know. You have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. Not based on feelings and info you MIGHT have later.

Right now, I´m disgusted by dad and brother. I want nothing to do with them. I don't trust them. And I even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

If my feelings change, I will deal with that when they do. Cross the bridge when I get to it and all.

I wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause I don't see the point. My story is kindda over.

But something happened yesterday and I wanted to share.

So I decided to stand by my ""fuck no, I don't wanna talk to them"". I'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. Grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, I asked him not to share and I know he wont. He is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. He called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

So mom showed up at his place (I've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can DECIDE whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. LOOOOL so mom goes INSANE, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, I'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". It goes on for a while until mom says I'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. He looks at me and says I'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

I was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, I broke. Mom left after a while and I just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, I'm your family, family doesn't leave. You remember that when you have one of your own"", and I fucking will.

&#x200B;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. I'm good. Grandpa is the shit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit - o, before I forget. Some people were asking about what my siblings were like. Well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships I had with friends, family, even a girlfriend I cared about). He was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. Mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. Grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. I guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, I'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200B;

another edit - I read the comment section to grandpa, I had to explain what OG is and he now wants to watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. Reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. But he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". The comment comparing him to Clint Eastwood made his day! Thanks for the love guys",relationship_advice
My husband has sex with me while I sleep wth?,"Ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. I know it sounds crazy! Im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. On a few occasions I've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows I'm waking up, he stops. I am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. I hate sleeping in clothes, I'm a naked sleeper but I don't think that is an open invitation right?

 Last weekend, I woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until I acted like I was still asleep, I wanted to see how far this was going to go.  I pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime I ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until I fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and I said.... was that good for you? HE TRIED TO ACT LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP!!! I told him I was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. His answer...I was horny, it wont happen again. 

Fast forward a week...I haven't been talking to him all week. I go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. I confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, I'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if I did that to him and when I asked why he stopped when I woke up he says because he knew I'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. I am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe I could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

At this point in feel like I can't trust  him anymore and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Do you think I should believe him? He is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though I've told him I've caught him before.

"Was I(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you.""","First, some back story. Sorry, little bit of a long one. My wife(24f) and I(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. Shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, I learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. She told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so I wouldn't notice. She was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. I completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and I hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

Day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. She thinks they're very unattractive. Well, not on every guy. She likes beards on certain actors. But definitely not on me. So I have stayed clean shaven for her. If I even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. She'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until I do shave. Progressively getting worse until I do the deed. But it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. I'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. If I could, I'd probably try to grow it out and see how I look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

Back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. Comfortable. These whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. After a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (I have average length hair). Now, I love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, I want that to be clear. But these whiskers: I'm not a fan of them. They're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

She gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. After a month of her not taking care of her issue, I finally said in the most loving way I could ""Hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. Your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" She got quite offended. But, she took care of the problem. A few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. I make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. Says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" Keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. It gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. I make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that I love her, and don't much care how she looks, but I'm not a fan of them. Which again, she was offended, but took care of it. Now I'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, I suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then I have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. Always getting pissed off that I dare say something. It's at the point where if I don't say anything, she won't do it.

A few days ago. She was ripping me a new one because I wanted to have sex, but I haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since I was ""too scruffy."" It's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. I snap and say ""this is bullshit, I shave almost every day for you. To look my best for you. But you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though I've kindly told you I don't like them."" and I finish with ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" Needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. We're okay now. I've shaved since then. She has not.

Was I wrong to have said this? Was I wrong to look at this as a double standard? Should I have approached this differently?

* Update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. We have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. She seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" I haven't tried to bring it up since.
* Update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. In this case, both. She says she doesn't like how I look with a beard. I've never had a beard while I've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, I do not know. Hell, I don't even know what I look like with a legit beard. Earlier in the relationship, if I had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" Which frankly, I understand. But then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* Update 3: PCOS. Yes, she has it. She's known she's had it for a long time. I believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. The hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. Up until recently.
* Update 4: everyone recommending I should post this in /r/AmItheAsshole. No can do. TIL that sub has a 3000 character limit. My post far exceeds that. Feel free to tell me if I'm the asshole here if you like.
* Update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. I will definitely mention these to her. When the time is right of course. I appreciate you folks.
* Update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*I'll shave when you do.*"" That works for me. I'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* Update 7: ""*You shared this story with your guy friends!? You're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? Lol. I actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. I only shared this argument with two of my very close friends. And I only mentioned the bits about her getting on me about shaving my own beard. Not the personal bits about her. Not that I need to defend myself, but there you go.

[Update] My(27F) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31M). Everyone thinks I should break up with him but I don't want to. What do I do?,"[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cohppg/my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m_everyone/)

Turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. They said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and I will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and I will no longer love him. I reassured him and made sure he understood I will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. Boyfriend and I agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. So that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, I feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. I've been told ""I told you so"" by my brother..

I have been putting off talking to his grandparents. But I will definitely talk to them before I let my son spend time with them again. I want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). I think I will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

Edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. Honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. Wasn't expecting it. I know many of you think that I should cut his grandparents off but I honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. Maybe he misunderstood. I will find out for sure when I speak to them. I am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes.",relationship_advice
My(39m) daughter (17f) wants me to sleep in her room because she broke up but I suspect something mire to it.,"Edit: The title should be more to it not mire.

I know this is actually a really weird situation. I'm sorry I do my best to raise her but I know that I can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

Yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. When I asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. She told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

I just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. She didn't want to talk today either. I think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. What do I do?

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

Just found out my girlfriend [26F] of 6 years was cheating on me while I'm [30M] spending the holidays with her and her family.,"My girlfriend and I have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. Things have been fine until five months ago when I found out she was using a subscription dating app. I was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. I believed her because I know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. After we got back together, I felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and I often felt neglected by her. She would spend a lot of time texting even when we are FaceTiming at night. She told me she texting her girl friends and I believed her. I went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. But I noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. She also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in March, but dodged questions when I asked for details of the guy. Finally, I've had it and looked through her FB messages, and I found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. I confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. Plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. But upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state I am going to graduate school in). She told me that they only kissed that night. I asked her to show me her texts and FB messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. I found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so I wouldn't be suspicious. She also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her Ex. She was apologetic when I confronted her and I made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. She reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

I feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. She's my first girlfriend and I love her so much. Her family treats me like another son. But the logical side of me knows that I cannot trust her anymore. I have to stay with her until Saturday and I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and FB for months even during the holidays when I'm visiting her. She met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

Update:
Thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. Maybe I'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. We talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. It was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). She pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. We both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. She feels ashamed of what she did. I will still stay until Saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. But we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. Being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. Thank you everybody for your input. ",relationship_advice
A Tinder experiment with my [28M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.,"Hi all. 

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. I met her IRL, but before that I was having no success with the Tinder game. She, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200B;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on Tinder, and I laughed with her and added ""Tinder's way worse for guys, though"". She didn't believe me when I told her most guys get 0 matches, and I wouldn't either. So we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up Tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. And the obvious happened: after one week, I had pretty much no matches except bots. On the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what I judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). She admitted I was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". We agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
The problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. Basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. I sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. When I asked if the Tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""I don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200B;

I feel like I've played myself here. Is this doomed or is there any way I can save it? 

&#x200B;

TL ; DR: played a Tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

My [36M] wife [34F] has been having an affair with her own brother and I realised our son might not even be mine.,"I dont know how or where to begin. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

My wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). New people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

My brother in law lives very close to us. He is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. My own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. This is something I never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. It wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that I got suspicious. Apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

Now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth I dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. That is just...disgusting to me. Tonight I did something which I never done or felt the need to do before, and I checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. Most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. But after having scrolled through a ton of messages I find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. I am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

Having sit here now thinking about what to do I cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. So many times have I heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

I am really at a loss at this point, I have no doubts about what she has done, but I cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

I feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

I want to divorce her, but I dont know how to go on about finding out whether I am the father or not, I really dont know what to do if I found out my son wasnt mine.

​

Edit: After reading several comments I decided it is best to not confront her now. My wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and I just told her I am not feeling well. I can barely look her in the eyes at this point. The only reason I am keeping it together is for my son. I wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so I will sit infront of the TV and sleep on the couch.

​

Edit 2: Had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. I wont be reading more PM's, I have gotten way too many of them.

Currently staying with my sister, I decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so I just told her I will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. My sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. I have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. We scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why I will get it via a court.

I will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something I will ever accept or can forgive. It's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. To the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

I will confront her but I cant tell when, probably tomorrow. My sister wants to come with me, but I wont let her, I will head over there by myself and let her know what I found out, will see where it goes from there...

I think my (22F) boyfriend (25m) mostly likes me because of my race.,"I've been seeing this guy for about 5 months. Everything has been going really well so far.

I'm half Japanese/Korean and half white. For reference, I've been told by multiple people, including him, that I look like kiko mizuhara. (although I don't agree, I love the compliment btw)

So I've known since the beginning that he loves Japanese culture. No biggie, whatever. I've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
Somehow my mom got brought up and how I'm more Japanese than Korean. He got weirdly excited. It kind of weirded me out, but I let it go.

Then he said that I ""shouldn't call myself white"" because I'm hapa. That pissed me off, but I didn't make a big deal out of it. Then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and I was so grossed out.
It escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that I felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. He got angry because he said I called him a nazi. (I did not. I said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault I have yellow fever"" and ""Japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

I'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with him. I've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. All of our friends are white, and I'm afraid they'll think I'm overreacting or something. Idk. I guess I'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay. 
Thanks

Edit:
Thank you everyone who responded. It really means a lot to me. To clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. I have decided to completely end things. I'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. The friends I have spoken to totally agree with me. I feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. So yeah, thank you all again. You all made this so much easier for me. I'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

Edit 2: again, I just want to thank you all! I've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. My friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. Honestly, I'm not super sad about it anymore. I feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. And to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. I really wish it were too.

Edit 3: wow! I really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. Again, thank you all. I'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. I just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. Thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

Edit 4: I just realized someone gave me gold n silver! Tbh, I don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! I'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. I can't thank you all enough. I wish I could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

Edit 5: Hey you guys. Just wanna give out another thank you. I wish I could read through everything, but I don't think I'll be able to! Just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. Not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when I said weeaboo, I mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- I've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like Kiko..."" I didn't say I did. I said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. I don't necessary think I look like her, but I do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe I will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. Reading through all of these comments, I'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- I'm talking about our mutual friends. I met a couple of them through him. Not all of my friends are white, and I knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. I didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but I would never be able to see him the same way. The damage was done.

Thank you all again.

Edit 6:
Okay, one more thing. I don't only date white dudes. Race has nothing to do with who I'm attracted to.. seriously. I never said I only date white guys. He just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. The area that I currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. I do not have ""white fever"", and I should not have expected this.

Please stop messaging me asking how tight I am. I will block you.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I (29M) showed up to my gf's (25F) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.,"Update to original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. I obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that I initially did not end the relationship. (What a regret).

How I handled it was we met the next morning to talk and I let her explain her side of things. She explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. Keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. Nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. I explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. So in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

I was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but I did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

We had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. Then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. There were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. I did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts I made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. Which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. This was getting old but I was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. The deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'You're the love of my life, I Love you more than anything, Future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. These were all exploited to be absolute lies.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. We had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. I let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding I then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. She did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. I let her know, 'Hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' It makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. She ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of Ok we will just talk later. I call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, I had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

She calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. I ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""Oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... I know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you I was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. I keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. She then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that I cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. She tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

Meanwhile, I knew I had friends going out that night as well and I could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. I did not tell her I was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 AM rolls around and Im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. I walk down the street and LO AND BEHOLD there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. One of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. Shocker, I know. I confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and NO accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. I turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because I'm sure i was irate. I have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. I walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. She shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. I tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. She says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. Even though i'm pretty hurt at this point I cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. I tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. Should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and I truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. I left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

I do want to say though, I made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. So many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i Just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. And it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing I have ever had done to me. Listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. If you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

Even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, I ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way I cared for them. Who knows how much longer I would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but I am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. Sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. Much Love.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. Felt I was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. Caught her on a date with another guy. Broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

Edit: I really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback I've gotten here. As well as all the insightful messages I've received. I am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. Thank you

Edit 2: For the people responding thinking I was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. Let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. I did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. Which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",relationship_advice
I (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex.....,"Ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. We have been married for 11 years in August. 

I love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. And it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. Every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". Sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

I constantly tell her how beautiful she is, I tell her how much she means to me, and I try my best to do whatever I can to lay signals that Im into her. I hug her, I stand close to her in public, I make it well known that Im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

She reciprocates none of it. She never comes on to me unless I straight up ask her to (seriously, Ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. I work long hours, and Ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. She gets upset if I cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and I came on top of her pussy). She keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. It fucking sucks. The sexiness factor is zero. I love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and Im not sure I can do it anymore. Its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

Anywho, it came to head tonight. I asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. She said yes. So the time comes, she was on me and I wasn't totally into it, so I started to get soft. I made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as I had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so I didn't ask). So she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. I lost it. I said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. This is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and Im fucking done with it. She has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

I cant live like this. There is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  Im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. This was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

Tldr: I am married to my roommate who I occasionally have sugar free vanilla sex with.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: Is a picnic basket too much on a first date?,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blwo1p/is_a_picnic_basket_too_much_on_a_first_date/

UPDATE: The date went really really well! Nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. The drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of Oregon and was super scenic. We only saw two other cars. When we got to the falls we were the only people. Chinook Salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. The bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. I kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. I think I did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. We stayed until it almost got dark. 


I did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this Indian Casino. She said she had never gambled in her life so I brought her in and we had a drink and I gave her 20$ to spend. She found this bee slot machine (my last name has Honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! At that point it was getting pretty late so I walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. I am going to see her this weekend again. Definitely STOKED!",relationship_advice
my (29F) boyfriend (27M) forced anal on me,"EDIT 3 (3/1): hey everyone, i just want to quickly tell everyone that i am alright and thankfully, my now ex-boyfriend has been dealt with appropriately. i am currently with my mother, and will hopefully get out of her hair once my old apartment gets re-set up (i never gave the apartment away since my sister wanted to move in but her taking longer than expected somehow worked in my favor). 

thank you everyone who supported me throughout this. i think im over it and it's just a thing that happened i guess.

EDIT: hey everyone. thank you all so much for the wonderful comments. i've been packing for the past 2 hours to go to my mom's, thankfully he still hasn't come back. if he ran away, its wishful thinking on his end. i talked to my dad, who is an ex-cop, and he knows some people that would help with my situation. 

i honestly cant believe what he did to me, even till now. it was so impulsive of him, he was never like this. regardless, im too disgusted by the thought of him right now. i consider myself to be a resilient person and can brush this off (the experience, not the problem itself), its just that im still shocked by what happened, and the fact that it did. ill reply to some of you as soon as im settled at my mom's.

i just wanna mention that i got a message from someone on here telling me that i should've expected it?? disappointed when i read that.

original post:

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 months. we're currently living together (for the past 2 months, edited this part due to people misunderstanding), and we're an admittedly kinky couple, so ""abuse"" is part of our sex routine. we are always safe about what we do, and have a safe word and everything.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn't wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear ""wanna try anal?"" but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said ""sure, just make it quick."" he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn't listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (""b******n"") 5 times and he didn't respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the ER and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn't healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven't seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don't know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this.",relationship_advice
Gf doesn't like me watching game of thrones,"So i watch game of thrones. My gf was watching it for the first time last night. I woke up to her ranting about the series saying ""there's nothing but tits in the series"". She then started shitting on me and saying that's the only reason i watch it.

[UPDATE] My (21M) friend (21F) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man.,"**Previous post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my\_21m\_friend\_21f\_is\_being\_forced\_to\_marry\_a\_43/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my_21m_friend_21f_is_being_forced_to_marry_a_43/)

First of all I want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. Your comments gave me further insight in this situation. I apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as I was busy with work.

So after my last post I talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. Fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. Later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21F). We explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( I know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. She is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). After lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. But she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14F) who would still be with her parents. So we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. So we convinced her to take her sister with her. We also involved her sister in our plan.

Now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. Which was managed by our professor *( Dr M. I will not give his full name here. But Dr sir I know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, I thank you million times. ).* Apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

So on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. We made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. After we had breakfast at one of my friends place. We all left for the train. We made sure she destroys her old sim card. Skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and I helped her unpack. Bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. We still need to take admission to school for her sister (Fortunately there are free schools for girls in India). And she recently landed a good job. So financially she is settled, but I will still be helping her however she needs.

Meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. We also informed women's welfare center about this. Things seem normal and I will keep you guys updated as things progress.

My [M20] girlfriend [F19] of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. I am completely broken. I need some support. UPDATE: My brother decided to end his life..,"Hi, I would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. I just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

If you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

As you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. I am his older brother, I am 23 years old while he was 20. That day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (I live in another city), and he decided to stay. We had a long talk, and I was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. He also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

Unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. He lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. I was trying my best. Until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from University so he could focus on healing himself. 

Two days ago I was at work, and he was at home, as always. When I came back I saw something that I hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. He hanged himself. It hurts me saying that. It was rather unexpected. Even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, I never thought he would actually do that. About a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when I asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

Right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.He thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. Even you guys. He said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad I love them. I can't keep up with this anymore. I am sorry. I love you"".

I tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. I don't blame him. Losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. Even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. I am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. We were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. It really sucks to say the least. I soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

I felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. I want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. You guys are amazing.

Thanks once again.

P.S: A few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. If you think that's the case then it's ok. I am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. Sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful. 

As for the rest of you, thank you people for the nice words.",relationship_advice
I think my (31/M) girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me and stole my money.,"We have been dating for around 2 years now.

Friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. It's a place her and I don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. Since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. Apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. She never came home Saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

There is no reason either of them would lie to me, I've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. Both super nice people.

I confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". I went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. All of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because I don't believe her and I think she was cheating. Worse though, she took MY fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck. Her name isn't on my bank account thankfully but it looks like she's trying to clean me out, how would I proceed?",relationship_advice
My (19F) boyfriend (22M) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat,"I've been dating this guy for about a year now. It's not a long time, I know, but I felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we've been known each other our whole lives or something. I sound so stupid, I know. I just really trusted and loved him. A lot. I trusted him with my life. A year cmon 

I went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she's so hot, you're so lucky etc so I was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of ME that my boyfriend secretly took while I was giving him a blowjob. I am pretty conservative, my parents don't even know that I'm not a virgin, and I have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows I do not do pictures because I don't want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. I remember him on his phone, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. I never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

I feel so disgusted I can't even describe the feeling in my stomach like I want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. All these pictures and videos he'd taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when I'm not looking at him. I just feel so fucking gross. And who sends that to their friends??? That's so weird!!! You're sending videos of you having sex to your ""bros"", that is so fucking weird. And the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

I cannot even believe he would do this to me. I was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said I was invading his fucking privacy. Seriously??? Your privacy feels invaded right now??? You clueless asshole. I just started yelling at him and honestly I'm not proud of it but I started hitting him and grabbed his towel. He was acting like I was overreacting and he started hitting me back. Are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. He started saying some bullshit how his friends think I'm so hot and they just compliment me and it's nothing bad. And you're not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew I was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. He wasn't even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think I'm so hot  

What kind of a betrayal. I wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. I have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and I just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. I feel so fucking exposed like I saw those videos, I had NO IDEA what was going on, in my head I was thinking about how much I love him and how happy I was and look at what this bitch was doing 

And he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he'll stop doing it. And he said he was really hurt that I'd take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he'd be waiting for my apology. He is so fucking clueless I don't even know what to say",relationship_advice
I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.,"Throwaway account because I don't want this linked to my main account.

&#x200B;

My older sister(let's call her Rose) and I have a great relationship since I was a baby. we were raised with an amazing adoptive family and she has always taken care of me.

I grew up in a very warm and loving environment but from what i was told I was lucky.

I was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. They never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. When my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when I was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. When I was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. We got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. We never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. Today I'm 19 and Rose is 34, I still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so I come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200B;

So a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a DNA test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. After the results came in I found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% Ashkenazi Jew) I found out later that I had an aunt\[33f\] in the system. I immediately reached out to her(Let's call her Jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. All that without telling Rose a thing.

When we met up I could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. We tried to figure things out so I asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. They never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

I connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. Mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. When I saw the picture, I knew. This was Rose, 100%.

Rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

I immediately gave Jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

I went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now I'm sleeping over at his place. I told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to Rose much.

I can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her I know the truth.

What the hell am I supposed to do? How should I handle this? Should I tell her I know?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). I thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. I have decided to break it to Rose this week but I need some time to think about how to tell her I know.I don't know if I should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. I even considered bringing her sister with me but I genuinely think she will be pissed. I'll keep updating as soon as I'll decide how to tell her. Right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: After seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, I decided I need to explain some things. First of all It's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. We were in foster care that time and Rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually Rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. At that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. At least that what I was told. I don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

"I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, I did not.","T/L/D/R

I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, meanwhile I'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.

UPDATE: I'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. I had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

I've decided I'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. I'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me. 

Many asking for updates, I'll try and come back when the test does. ",relationship_advice
My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I'm Jewish...,"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/beskkf/update_my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

We've been together for 3 months and I had no idea that she held those beliefs. She's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. This is completely out of character and I'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass Jew"". I was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

For the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she's Middle Eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


She continued saying that you can't trust Jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". I asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


I still haven't told her that I'm Jewish, I'm not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she's an amazing girl and I'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. Any advice?

"It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.","HAPPY UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


Title may seem harsh so I apologize. Also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

Bit of background info about my wife: She's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. So to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

To make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. Of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. For the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch Netflix in bed. I brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least I could do.

But now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching Netflix in bed all day. I ask her every day if she needs anything but all I get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". Virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. Therapy. She said that all therapists spew BS back at you.
2. Adoption or using a surrogate. She shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. Moving to her parents' city. She said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. Buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). She snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. Taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. Again, she said that's too much stress.

Earlier tonight I had a talk with my wife. I told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. She said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

Don't get me wrong, I love my wife with all my heart. I'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. I know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly I cannot bear living like this for much longer. What do (or can) I do?",relationship_advice
"[32m] My wife [33f] will not shut up, and I'm not sure I can take it that much longer. Is it possible for that to be a reason to leave?","I'm not sure if I should have posted this on AITA instead.  But here goes: My wife will not shut up.  I'm not talking about your usual Chatty Cathy.  I mean she (almost) literally will NOT. SHUT. UP.  She will talk continuously from the moment she knows I am within earshot.  Not just in the same room.  I mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that I can hear her.  She will not *stop* talking until I'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  On more than one occasion, I've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before I went in.  She also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  So I get to hear ALL the bathroom noises on top of whatever Homeric Epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
I once drove from Tampa, FL to Chicago, IL with her (before we were married- I'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  She did not stop talking the entire way.  The ENTIRE way.  
  
Television on to a show I like?  Pfft.  That's not a problem.  She'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  Having sex?  That's the perfect time to tell me about how Olivia Newton John still has the leather pants she wore in Grease and she- brace yourself- STILL fits in them!  Really!  Needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  Ever.  I've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
I get it.  She grew up in a huge Italian Catholic family in the Bronx.  If you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  I, on the other hand, grew up in a Scandinavian family with two children.  To this day, I'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  I actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  I was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  She never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her I'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
That's not true, though.  Another difference between people of Swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  Other than the Minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  No ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  A nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  I think it has a lot to with living in the frigid North.  You keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
To her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  She's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did I just say?""  I've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  She'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and I'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if I had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  And she'll say ""yeah!"" and think I've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
I joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  Our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  Growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  And you talked loud so they didn't finish.  My son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  It got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  I didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now I know why Josh has a stutter.""  Just like that.  
  
She's failed at least one job interview because of this.  I know because I lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  He called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
We rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  She monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  Who wants more than one does of that?  
  
You're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  Yes.  Many times.  Sometimes jokingly.  Sometimes with utter seriousness.  The reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person I know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  The one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
I try not to let it get to me.  She's a very affectionate woman.  Loves me to death.  Mother of my child.  Pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  We still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but I'm pretty busy so I don't really notice as much).  But it *does* get to me.  It's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  There's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
I know the answer to the problem: I have to ""talk back.""  In effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  I would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  I would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  I would have to learn to use Italian Hand Gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  But I'm not Italian.  I'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
Twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  I'm not sure I can take it that much longer.  I'm just not sure if I could get a word in to tell the judge why I'm there in his divorce court.  My wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: Wife will not shut up.  Is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
EDIT: Obligatory Reddit ""omg I had no idea this would blow up.""  Which is true.  I thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  But RIP, Inbox.  It was nice to know ya.  So in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, I will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions I saw popping up multiple times.  
  
Also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
Q1 - Is this BS? (implied)  
A1 - No, it's all mostly true.  I admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  The bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  Not from sexy times, anyway.  She probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
Q2 - Why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was OP's wife hot?)  
A2 - Yes, she is hot.  And funny.  And vivacious.  Also, I really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/Sarah_Dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  And if I'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a LOT of things don't seem all that terrible.  [Damn you, Penis!  This is all your fault!]  
  
Q3 - Did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
A3 - Medically speaking, I cannot state this with 100% certainty.  The cause was never formally diagnosed.  However, I watched it happen first hand.  I'm not a qualified speech therapist, but I think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations I made.  I'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  Which leads to:  
  
Q4 - Aren't *YOU* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  After all, you did nothing to stop it.  
A4 - Guilty.  And I feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  For the record, I did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  But I think by the time I realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  And anything I could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  All the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  If there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and I'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
Q5 - Is it because she's (pick one: OCD, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
A5 - I don't think so, although I've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  I see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
Q6 - Have you tried counseling?  
A6 - No.  Probably should have, but I know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  It's bizarre that I can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, I've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  And yet, I'm seriously considering divorce.  I realize the contradiction there.  ",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving","I will be posting the update here instead since I am still receiving PMs to update what happened. I am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me I am not allowed to post an update thread there) so I got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. This is the post I posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. Will try my best to update it as time goes.

Here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

[CLICK HERE to see my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. I have had quite a few PM's regarding what happened and I got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. I want to let you all know that the support I have received has been incredible (both in PM and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

I am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the PM's, theres just too many to respond to but I would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

I would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, I tried to respond but I noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but I still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. Much love to you all.

I basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. I cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that I found out BEFORE i got married, with no children or attachments. I still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, I guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, I honestly dont know and dont care.

When I was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after I left reddit, she had woken up. She noticed the drinks out and asked me what I had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. I followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, I didnt want to give her any hint of what I knew. She asked my why I had been drinking and why I didnt come to sleep last night and I told her I was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. I felt detached, like I was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

She asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". She got herself done and left for work.

I basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. I planned on leaving things like furniture, TV and other things I really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. I just took the stuff most important to me so that I dont have to return here again. I dont care if she gets the rest. All in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

I called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and I really dont care at this point.

I also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

Around 1 pm I called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. I didnt leave any note or pictures at home, I just left. I am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

Around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 I start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

The only person I called back was my dad and mom. I have a huge trust for my parents, I basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. I told them its ended, and that I wont be getting married no more. I also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what I told them, I trust them alot so I am sure they wont say anything. I didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that I found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

Around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. I just told my dad not to intervene and that I need some alone time now.

I basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. Been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

I dont know if I should respond to them now or wait some more? Her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). I am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

Once again, thank you to everyone who replied. I will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, I know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. I hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

Time here is 10 pm soon.

TL;DR Found out my fiance cheated and I left without saying anything. Not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

EDIT 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

EDIT 2: Thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. I will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. I might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. I honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
Shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",relationship_advice
My gf is dirty as hell and I can't stand it,"So my gf (22f) is one of my biggest blessings in life, but man is this girl dirty as hell. When we first initially met she had told me, but I was like naw can't be that bad... boy was I wrong. 

Just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. Let's talk dirty:

The kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. Dishes will pile up. Trash gets full. Unless I clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc I can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. I have talked to her before about how I shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

Laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. She be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. Half the time I do her laundry and I have to ask her to fold it. If I don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

Room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. She will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for DAYS. Things start to cultivate! 

Honestly, I have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. I explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. Whenever I bring it up she gets annoyed. She will clean the day after I mention it and then never do it again until I bring it up AGAIN. Ugh. Advice, suggestions?


EDIT: WOW this really blew up! I just wanted a little advice so that I could hear different perspectives. Some of you provided great advice so I appreciate that! Will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] Am I in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?,"EDIT: his friend messaged me and said I had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. I haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

When my boyfriend got home I told him we had to talk, he agreed. I was going to tell him how messed up this was and I am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

Turns out I don't need to tell her because he already did. She was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so I won't know where that side is going.

He apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. We had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think I minded, but now understands I didn't agree. He said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when I confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. He was completely remorseful and I even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. He said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. This is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and I have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""I just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

Even so, he went to his parents for now. We had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but I don't really know anyone. I'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

Until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. We always hung out and had great times. Only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. He did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. He wanted to pay for me to go back to school. He believed in me and supported me when I started my writing. He helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. All the nights he stayed up with me while I cried.

I wish this never happened 

I don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. I definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. He says he'll give me all the time I need and if I can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

Thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

To all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and I should be happy he wanted to show me off; I hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

Edit: just to add about the drinking. We had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. Going as far as insulting me. We talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. We just drink with friends now so I definitely think that is a big part of it. This was a couple years ago. It also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. But this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

I also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so I know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

My (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated I won't talk to her,"Exactly what the title says. My coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because I was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( I took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why I'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but I'm coming and going 'as I please'.


Me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that I had a miscarriage. Her response? 'I told you you were pregnant! Why the hell are you here? You need to be home! This is why you had the miscarriage! You don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. What is wrong with you? You are being so stupid! You don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. Come on, really. Who do you think you're telling this to? I'm a woman! I have gone through things like this! Don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. Honestly, take care of yourself. '


And then with that she announced she was going on break and I sobbed in the bathroom. I pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. Then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but I've moved desks. I'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. Today she tried to send me a birthday gift and I refused. She is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. She also tried to coordinate breaks with me. I, of course, insisted that I break at a different time. 

This is making her frustrated and I am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why I no longer want to engage socially with her. I am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. How do I explain to her I don't want to be friends with her anymore? Is there a way I can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

TLDR: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why I didn't get in trouble, I explained that I miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that I shouldn't be surprised if I can't get pregnant again. Now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset I didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

Update: First, thanks for the support. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


Second, she ended up submitting a false report saying I interrupted her work day and withheld important information. It is false. I have witnesses, I was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. I will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier.",relationship_advice
Dumped before Valentine's Day,"So.... It's 11:09pm on February 13th. Less than an hour until Valentine's Day. And my boyfriend of 7 years, who I had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. No explanation, nothing. Then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. Needless to say, I'm super confused and completely devastated. How am I supposed to survive Valentine's Day? It's always been our day. We've always done something big and extravagant because Valentine's day is our anniversary. And I just feel crushed. Some people have suggested I have a girls night, but I don't have really any friends that live near me. And I really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. Any advice?

Edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and I have a 2 year old son together. So it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. I'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. And we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before Christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by January 1st. It was such short notice, and right at Christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. He lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. So he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

Edit 3: My son was only in this post so people could understand that I'm not just being a whiny bitch because I got dumped. I'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. And please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. That was my decision, not yours. Oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. We got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and I weren't around. We live in NY where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. So I'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted.",relationship_advice
My [29m] girlfriend [24f] tried to throw me under the bus when the police searched my house,"First I'd like to start with some background. My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. She stays at my house about 75% of the time. We have had no major problems before this point.

On Saturday night, we were watching TV in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. My immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, I found that it was the police.

At this point I was extremely confused. I don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. I have no firearms in the house. I do nothing illegal online; I don't even pirate Game of Thrones. I had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a Saturday night.

I opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. I asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. In turn, I refused to give them permission. My girlfriend repeatedly said I should cooperate. I said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. They then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what I thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

The first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and I into separate rooms and begin questioning us. I kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local PD is backwater and shitty enough. 

I refused to answer any questions. I told them I wanted a lawyer if I was under arrest. I repeated that I did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you Breaking Bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

My girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. I didn't hear much because she was in the next room but I overheard her say this:

>You should check the back yard shed! I've never been in there before and I can't say what's in it...

At the time I could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" Well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, I'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. At that point I asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

I don't need legal advice. My mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. She's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. I'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""I panicked and didn't know what to do."" What I need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their S/O under the bus like that.

Does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

"Fiance wanted an open marriage, so I called off the wedding. People are asking questions. Should I let them know why?","&#x200B;

For those that keep messaging me for an update, it was posted long ago, and it can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99y261/update_fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called/).

\-----

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

She asks me to go to therapy with her. She was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. That sounded a little weird to me, I thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

Also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. I have never met her therapist. So to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

The day comes, and I go there. But out of self preservation, I had my phone opened and recording any audio.

My fiance was already there. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was invited in. The therapist greets me and shakes my hand. We have small talk. She tells me I am not at all the way my fiance described me. I think she is trying to compliment me. Then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

That absolutely weirded me out. But I am a calm and collected individual, and I don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

So the therapist starts talking. Has a small speech I don't care to repeat. My fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

I smile, I am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind I am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. Modern woman and girl power and all that.

Nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

The other non-traditional type of marriage. I forgot it's 2018.

But she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

Because she would be too heart broken knowing that I find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

So I let them finish talking. They were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because I wasn't saying anything. This was definitely something they have rehearsed.

I then asked the therapist if she is licensed. This, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. She said yes. So I told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

I wished them good luck, and left the office.

Now, I want to report the therapist. I am not sure if I have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? I don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and I want her to pay for the misconduct. That ""session"" did not sit well with me.

To be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. Even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where I could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. That's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

It also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. Now that I have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

So I was a fool anyway.

I listened to the recording, and I still can't believe what was said there.

Anyway, I called off the wedding.

I am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because I am not seeking them. There are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. That might have given my ex the impression I will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. Having listened to the recording a few times, I am confident the therapist recognized I am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

Now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions I am not comfortable answering.

How do I navigate this sea?

I am sure my ex is doing damage control, but I have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, I will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

But my parents and family also want answers, and I am not sure what BS to tell them. I don't want them to think I am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

She is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""We can work on this"", ""I didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

Last cry of a dying siren. All her cries fall on deaf ears, and I am the owner of said ears.

We were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but I cancelled everything.

I basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

Her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. I had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

Regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once I figure out where to do it, and what to say.

This post is mostly a rant, but I would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. My Ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and I don't want to be a he said / she said. I do have the recording, and am wondering if I should send it to the interested parties.

My ex doesn't know I have the recording.",relationship_advice
I (21f) had sex with a guy I met on Tinder last night (25m). To me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me I took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. What in the hell do I do?,"I guess some background is in order, I met this guy on Tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on Wednesday and agreed to meet again on Saturday. I did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

So last night we had a great time. We ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. The sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again I had no idea he wasn't into it. So after finishing I was just telling him hat I really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

At first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. I was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. Then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what I had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that I knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. I told him that I was really sorry but I saw it differently. He ended up getting dressed and ran out. He was crying so loud and so intently I could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

He drove away and I haven't heard anything from him at all. I am so lost as to what to do. 

1. Should I call him and apologize? Even though I feel I didn't do anything wrong?

2. Should I call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. Should I just Swayze him and say I've dodged a bullet?

4. Should I actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


Thank you so much for the help!! I'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy I met on Tinder. I'm lost as to what to do next?
 

Edit as of 840 AZ time: he just called me. He was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. I said I wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. He kept trying to goad me into talking and I asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. Something tells me I stepped in a HUGE pile of shit. My dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

Well if I become the first female #metoo you saw it here first. 

Edit2: you pathetic little mgtows and MRA Incels can stop saying ""if the genders were reversed"" or see this as some sort of ""get em guys"" cause celeb. It's been said already. Morons.

"[UPDATE] I feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout.","We didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on Saturday. I wanted to speak about things in person.

I didn't want to go in all accusatory so I just started to say how I feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). I talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

How ""Cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. Just a source of entertainment and that upset me. They let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. There is ALWAYS a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. It's like a show. I thought it was a coincidence until I knew it was kinda...orchestrated? Black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. Not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. I told him that I didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. But I talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. He listened to me the entire time without jumping in and I've never had someone do that before so I appreciated it.

He spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. That's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. But never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. He sees things differently than I do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. Also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. But you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. Then we talked about why we were with each other and I won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

Then we started talking about the ""Drip or drown"" for guys and **""If she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

We both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. He was Frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. But the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. At the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. It's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

His dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. It offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. Plus, they're just fun to be in.

So everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

Also people got so mad because I called myself pretty. Women are told to accept compliments all the time, but I do it...it makes me conceited? I'm hella pretty and I know it. Stay mad.

But to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**Edit: Guys I read the comments and I'm more confused...I really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. He listened to me and I thought all I could do is wait until I see if he follows up. He seemed genuine and I do give him the benefit of the doubt. But maybe I shouldn't...Idk here.**

**I've never dated outside my race and I have mostly black friends, so I've never been in this position before. I came here to get different opinions and I did. I guess what I'll do now is watch closely. I really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**",relationship_advice
(Update to) I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"I was thinking I'd edit the original post, but I decided I'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. Since the original post really blew up I don't think too many people would see an edit, so I'm making a new post instead.

I took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the OBGYN visit. The IUD was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. However, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. It's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. I ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. Eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

Normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. We sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. Eventually the sun began to set and I decided it was time. I started to say I had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. She told me she understood so I skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. After we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (I knew she used reddit but I didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. She said she would have preferred I proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

Although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, I am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. We're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. We're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

These past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. Thanks for helping me get over my worries.

I showed up to the house while he was at work. (I have a key and my mom was there so this wasn't an issue.) When he got home a few hours later he nearly crashed into my car out of excitement. 

We said hello. I asked him if he liked my shirt. He kind of confusedly said yes. I told him I got him one too, he laughed and got up to grab it. I unfolded it so he could see what it said and he just about stopped breathing. Then he took it and went into the kitchen, pretty clearly because he didn't want us to see him cry.

My family is mad that I don't want my heroin addicted cousin at my wedding,"For starters, I'm already married and my husband and I are planning a ceremony and party for the family as we got married without anyone present in city hall. 

We're trying to keep it small, 50 to 60 people and honestly I have no relationship with the cousin I speak of. But I made it clear to my mom as she was asking me about other family members that he absolutely was not to be there.

My cousin showed up to my three year olds birthday party high as a kite. Falling asleep standing up and looking like absolute shit. My aunt brought him. I was absolutely bullshit that she would bring him around not only my kids but her own grandchildren as well. He has stolen money at almost every family gathering we've ever had. 

Why the hell is my family mad at me for it? I don't want my kids around that and I damn well don't want the topic of our wedding to be what is wrong with my cousin?

[Update] Husband [31] makes fun of me [25] around his family for earning little money,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auqsw3/husband_31_makes_fun_of_me_25_around_his_family/?st=JSOK2D24&sh=a811ec0c

I took the advice in the comments and confronted him in front of his family by making a „joke"". At first there was silence till his brother made up a fake laughter to calm the situation as you literally could feel the tension. My husband just gave me a poisonous look and didn't say anything. Later at home it became a huge fight were he hold a speech about his „role as man"", „his proud"" and that I were unable to be a „good ,caring wife who supports her husband"".
As I didn't shut up this time he told me to fuck off. I took a few things of mine and went to my parents'. I can't believe that he changed to this person as I met him as a open minded man. And I can't believe we were trying to have a baby together. I'm glad I could opened my eyes before it went that far. I'm going to divorce. My parents are thinking that it's a temporary situation but I don't wanna risk a life in abuse and handcuffs.

Update: I think my brother ejaculated on me while I was asleep,"Previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bka4o1/i\_think\_my\_brother\_ejaculated\_on\_me\_while\_i\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bka4o1/i_think_my_brother_ejaculated_on_me_while_i_was/)

&#x200B;

The same thing happened a second time the day after I posted that, so I went along with the suggestion of filming myself while I sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever I napped during the day/evening.

&#x200B;

Long story short it clearly is my brother, I've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. I have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if I should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didnt expect so much advice! I'm going to read everything. And for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. So I'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

&#x200B;

2nd Edit: I want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. Some very calm sounding people have suggested I speak to my brother before anything else, so I'm going to do that. I know some others have warned not to do this, but I think its important to speak to him first. If it goes badly with him then I can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if I speak to them first I can't undo it.

I'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - I'm 14, he's 13. As for why I 'let him do it a second time', well I do still have to sleep, and I kept recording myself until I made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. Also a lot of people asking how I know what semen smells like. How do you think? Calm down and stop calling me names.",relationship_advice
"*UPDATE - Don't want to have a ""Click-Bait"" Title - Wife's Wedding Band(s)","[**\*\*\*Original Post\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/)

So, I have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  We kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  What we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  While ordering, Oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is ASTOUNDED, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  Youngest son says he can fix THAT and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""WTF is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  She is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, I take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits PERFECTLY on her finger, and she has quite LITERALLY had enough!  She finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until My oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and I place the next size on the table.  At this point she's just staring at all of us, and I explain what had happened, and how I was able to find the jeweler, etc.  I even showed her the Reddit post.  She didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  Lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

She (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have KILLED me if I had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

So, about the jeweler.  They responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  The oldest son IS making jewelry and doing repairs ONLY to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  Once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  They sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  I followed up asking if there was ANY way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  Regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""Texan"" Gift Package and sending it to them.

And that's it.  She is extremely happy and overjoyed.  I am really glad it's ""over"" as I had NO idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent Silver, Gold, and Platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***Edit - I keep reading comments about the Jewelers, and this being fake.  The Daughter, Son, and an Uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  From what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  So, take that however you want, I have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have ZERO reason to be dishonest.  I really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  Follow the old adage ""If you can't say something nice.....""

TL;DR - Took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred.",relationship_advice
How do I break the news to my girlfriend and my relationship of 2years?,"We have been dating for quite some time now ( about 2years) and in every way she(F 25) made me feel I'm the only one until recently I found out she has been cheating on me with different guys, apparently one of her one-nighters got in his feelings, tried to date her and her refusal to date the guy whom is a [hacker/developer](https://y3llowl4bs.com) (M 32) , infiltrated her phone just to get back at her.

I (M 28) got a mail addressed to me from someone using with the subject, "" lost but found"" , with anxiety I clicked open the email and behold several nudes of my girl with different guys, the sender did not leave a name but with a short message, ""you've been a fool all along and a contact that led to a [somd3v dude on telegram](https://t.me/somd3v) should incase I have questions.

In no time I reached out to the contact , at first I thought it was a blackmail scheme to extort me but at that point I actually do not give a fuck so I bumped the question, who are you and what do you want? After minutes of back and forth conversation, he revealed a lot of truth about my girl he found out on her various social media accounts and he was only trying to save me from future heartbreak.

My (28F) family (18-88) missed my little brother's (18M) graduation. How can they make it up to him?,"He's upset. He cried. He went to everyone of his cousin's and siblings graduation and none of them came for his. Our mom missed it for work. Our grandma missed it because she had a doctor's appointment(completely understandable). Uncle and aunt missed it because they didn't think he would care. Cousins had work. Siblings missed it because they thought they could waltz right in at the end because his name was one of the last ones called in a student body of 900. But the ushers wouldn't let anyone in after a certain time. They were a hour late. It was just me and a cousin. I cried and cheered when he walked. My baby brother graduated today and he's miserable. 

I am worried about him. My family is blaming the school and each other right now. Im disappointed in everyone else. They're trying to force him to hang out with them to make up for it, but of course nothing will make it up to him. What can I or they do/say to help him feel better?

EDIT : Thank you for all the advice. I guess I didn't have to worry too much. He needed time alone to think it over in his room. He's definitely stronger than me and more mature. He said he hated feeling sad, so he stopped. Also said he understood that everyone had other things to do. Hopefully his next graduation is a lot better. Maybe I'll post an update in 4 years.

Modified Post

Throwaway account. Indian here.

Background

Mine was an arranged marriage. Met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. Got married 2 years back. We are both from Bihar. Both educated. Living in a metro city currently. We got along just fine.

My wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. We were having sex for just its sake. Slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. No issues there. I always suspected something was off with her. One day something happened after which she got very emotional. I consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. Started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(I didnt ask how many times). Her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. She just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. She said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). She didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

After 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . Her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. All these things stopped after fixing of marriage. She said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . I wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. Think about family honour. What would relatives think if it got out.. It happened to me , not you. I dont want it to come out. Past is past... all emotional storm.

This all happened 1.5 years back. From then I made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. Always with me. We get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

Now present problem :

We had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. But I don't want my baby to go even near that man. She is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. Okay fine. Nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. But just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. I cant let that man even near her. Not now, not ever. I dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, I would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. Just the thought of him touching my innocent child, I cant handle it. I dont know what Im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? What should I do now ?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

The unequivocal suggestion I got from here was that I should not let her go . I called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. They understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that I can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). So I have to come up with a different solution. And that was of confrontation. I sat down my MIL, and my wife and told both of them that I don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. First she tried to act aloof, but I maintained my strictness and told I don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to YOUR daughter, and I WILL NOT LET HIM DO IT TO MY DAUGHTER. Period. Get it through your head. After I made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, I won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. I again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. There was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. You could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... Nobody could fake that.

I went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. That evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my MIL had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. So I made my demands :

1. I only got leave for 1 week only, so I would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and I would return. Not a day more. She would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. I would get return tickets beforehand.
2. She would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. She would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my FIL, or I would publically make a scene, I won't care who is saying what. I would take my daughter from him and leave. Period.

She was reluctant for the 3rd point, but I was adamant. She finally agreed. Next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and I was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

For my wife part, after my MIL left, I told her that Im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. It's a coping mechanism. (Didn't tell her I posted it online, or used the words like PTSD). She got defensive again. Someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. Was worried about it too. Told her she need therapy. Now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. I don't know, maybe she was hormonal. For 2 days she was pissed. And was definitely not ready to talk about it.

Well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. I think here I did something of a fuck up. After normal checkups, I told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. I was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. I was sitting outside thinking I had fucked up the whole situation. But when I was called inside, my initial instincts were right. The doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). She referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. Situation with my wife is tense now. She has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. We are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. I guess my MIL will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. Now I'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

We are leaving this weekend, hope I don't have to face any more drama there. Will update if anything happens.

Thankyou reddit.",relationship_advice
"My sister(F22) ripped up my(F19) Stan Lee autograph and I haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46F) is pressuring me to, for families sake.","I made a post yesterday but forgot my password so I made a new alt.

Okay so I am a huge Marvel nerd. The kind of nerd that Cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. Mostly fanservice.

My sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". She claims I am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

Besides that we have a good relationship. We are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

So 3 years ago I managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the USA and meet the real Stan Lee! He signed one of my own pictures I did of the big 3 and complimented it. It's was one of the best days of my life.
Since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

Flash forward. A few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and I tell her no. Reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. She pouted and I left the house.

When I come back is see my fucking Stan Lee autograph ripped up on the flor! I fucking lost it. Then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). When she saw that I was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that I can get a new one.

I pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. She tries to engage in conversation but I shoot her down. She tries to bribe me with movie tickets and I tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. She hasn't apologized for it. She just says that I should be over it by now.

My mom says the same. She says a materialistic things shouldn't come In between family and that I should simply let it go. My dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. He is as big on Marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. This whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

My mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and I think they both disrespected me. Mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

I feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. Can somone help me with this?

Edit :thanks guys for listening to me. I feel a lot better. I will take what many of you said and I am going to send them examples of how much Stan Lee's autograph costs. But I think I have to word it very good so that they don't think that I would ""split up the family over money""

Update : Thanks for the support. My dad and I found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. Dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment.

So after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, I decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that I now wonder why I was ever worried. He reassured me that I wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that I just had a little problem that I needed help with. We're now looking for a good therapist for me. Already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. I can't wait to work through this so I don't have to feel the way I do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words! Reading these wonderful comments really made my day. Honestly I didn't expect this to get so much attention, I was just very excited and felt like telling someone, anyone :)  Even though I cannot reply to all these lovely messages, I truly appreciate them.

Middle schooler here- how do I stop my mom from posting my entire life on Facebook?,"This is on a throwaway because my mom knows of my main account.

For the past couple of years I've tried to install an ""ask me first"" policy, but since I don't have a FB account of my own, this is hard to monitor. I can only really tell when I manage to get into her phone. The last time I did this I saw some.. grade related stuff. 

I feel like I have absolutely no privacy. I can't talk to my own mother for fear she'll post it on social media. I'm her child, not her dog, and I'd like to be treated as a human being. However, I love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. This is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me. 

TLDR: My mom didn't respect my wishes and stop posting personal things about me on Facebook, how do I get her to understand how violated I feel?",relationship_advice
Was I raped,"I've been seeing my girl for the past 4 months. Shits been good but yesterday she had sex with me after saying I didn't feel like it. That day I worked a 14 hour day and had been up at 5 am, I was super tired. I went home and she wanted to play so I just complied at the beginning and just did some foreplay. I started to eat her pussy but I was legit falling asleep so I told her I'm too tired and all that. So I went to use the bathroom but she pushed me back to the bed, and was like I want you in me now I said no. She then just pulled my shorts off and rode me, I just froze I'm a pretty big dude close to 200 pounds and she's like 110 but that day I was to tired to do anything. After I came I felt really fucked. 
Am I overthinking things or nah I feel like I'm partly responsible for playing with her and drive her over the edge but I feel really weird now. ",relationship_advice
My (29F) husband (31M) is no longer attracted to me after an accident that burnt my face.,"My husband and i have been happily married for 6 years and he has been nothing but a kind, attentive and caring spouse whom i love very much.

I attended a Christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. I was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

My husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. I just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. He just looks differently at me now.

The other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. He kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. I know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

The next week we tried again and the same thing happened. He then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. It was soul crushing to hear that. He tries though. He cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

Is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? But how how can i if even i don't think i am?

TLDR: I was in an accident that burnt half my face off and my husband no longer finds me attractive",relationship_advice
[update] My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

Hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure I owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. Plus I've had some time to calm down. I probably wont reply to comments because otherwise I'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

If you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... And your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. It's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

Wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while I was at work. This was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. I dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting her to say, but I genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. Because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

When I get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. Not an apology. An ultimatum that if I went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering I owned the house before marrying her...)

I asked her if she was serious. If she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. Yeah, okay. At this point I remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. I asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. I kept pushing her and she kept saying no. Finally I told her that I had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  I explain that if I find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, I'm divorcing her immediately. She immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""Only"". Fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

Anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. Her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). I tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. She wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. I mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but Jesus Christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

I feel like I don't even know my wife. The woman I thought I married had some fucking empathy.

She still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. I explained she no longer has a say in the matter. Had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, I would have listened to them and taken them seriously. But by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

I told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or I would call a divorce lawyer. I also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether I meet with this girl, but I would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

A few hours later she ""apologised"". I say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. But whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. So we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

Tbh though, I don't think I'll ever see her the same way again. So I have doubts our marriage will last.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I [22F] broke up with my [34M] boyfriend (7 months ago) because I found an engagement ring. He came to my work today and PROPOSED. Help me. Please.,"First of all I'd like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. I know it was all over the place and at first I was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and I got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. Thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. I really appreciate it. 

If you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that I was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. Well, I did. He came to my place after work. And I'm crying as I type this, because the majority of you were right about him. My heart feels broken and I don't know what to do from here. I can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and I can clarify things more now because I'm no longer defending him. This post is gonna be a very long post so, I'm warning you now you may be here long.

When he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if I needed any help then I could get it. He was not happy that she was there, I told him that's the only way I'll speak is if she's there because I don't think being alone together is appropriate.
First of all, he went on a tangent about how I should never of made that post and that I was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because I changed the password to the account before I made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. He was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. Whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
For those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

First of all it started with a Tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me Reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. Most of which, I weren't comfortable with. I mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""If you love me, you'll do it"", ""You know how happy it would make me"", ""You'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. He'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do CNC, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. The public posting of the experiences got him off and I wanted to make him happy.
And before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which I'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. Stupidly I didn't question his intentions and I know I was naive, I just thought as I hurt him it was the least I could do. Obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. Also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

We spoke about our sex life, and I asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew I was apprehensive, and he denied it. Said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought I would enjoy all those things and I'd want to do them with him because the thought I would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). Honestly, by this point when he was talking I could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. Just from that, I started to feel a bit more sane and like I could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. I was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that I've not put any of what I have on you on social media, I could ruin your life but I choose not to because I love you and I'm not that type of person""
Like, fucking really? Who even says that? That's such a passive threat. So, now I'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

Then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. I told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 MONTHS of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. I told him I didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. He didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. Told me I'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because I can't have kids so I'm useless to most men so I should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
I kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? And his response was ""you did for 4 years"". So, the majority of you were right, to him I was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. And all of this actually hurts, because I genuinely loved this person, and now I'm confused about how I could've been so naive to not notice anything. Part of me thinks I was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that I missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I gave him the ring back and told him I don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. Literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever I want (I've never been financially dependent on him, I have my own place) and do whatever I want him to do to make it right. I told him there's nothing I want from him anymore and that I want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. It wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and I'll remember why I love him. At which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. His face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

So he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. My friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. And that was the end of that.
Now I'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, I've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so I can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
My best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last I hear from him, so at least if anything else happens I've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

Thank you for all your advice, seriously. I received a lot of criticism on my last post but I'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when I was defending him and in denial, without you I wouldn't of had the courage to end it. I also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because I was so far under his spell.
I'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and I did genuinely love him, and now because I know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish I don't really know what to think, and I feel stupid and like an idiot that I didn't notice it. And now I don't know where I go from here, and I'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
I've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so I'll be starting the healing process soon. I guess I've gotta focus on myself now. I'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know I won't be going to any events if he's there etc, I've blocked him on all social media, I know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
I just hope I can get through this.

I [34M] just discovered the real side of my girlfriend [33F],"We had no issues before, and she was my role-model. I'm honestly shocked by this.

Yesterday I got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the TV and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around Christmas time.

After a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating Christmas dinner. My girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""Look at that crap dinner."" I didn't really react to her comment.

The mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""That looks like cow's placenta."" that's when I sat up and said ""Are you serious?""

I told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" Christmas dinner, I told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

Then she said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on Christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

That was when I lost my shit and just went home. I haven't talked to her since. I'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice

[Shocking] My GF sisters boyfriend has a crush on her,"I'm [25/M]. I started dating this girl [22/F], it's only been 3-4 months, but ALOT has happened since then.

She has a sister [18/F] and her sister has a boyfriend [21/M]  who have been together for 6 months. When I first met her sister and her sister bf,  I thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. My gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes I think it was too much. 

Little by little I started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. In the beginning I felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but I always thought ""maybe I'm trippin, that's just how they are, it's nothing"" and left it alone. 

Then more weird shit happened. 
Like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. Nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. It was weird to me bc she tells me that they're like a brother and sister. Brothers and sisters don't dance that way. I ignored that situation and kept it moving.

Another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. So he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. They switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  The weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and I asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. A picture says a thousand words. While my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. She posted that pic but deleted it after I said it was weird and people kept asking her ""who's the lucky guy"" .  At this moment I was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

As time went on and my gf and I got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. Every time i would Hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, I'd feel the hate in his eyes.  He'd mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her ""family"" (him and her sister). He would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. When my  gf would say no, he'd get angry. 

It got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. Everything was all good. I wasn't there yet but when I arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. It was like that the rest of the night. 

When they left, I finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. We had a long talk about that situation and other things. At first she didn't see things that way I seen them but started to put two and two together. She didn't want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. She was not convinced But agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she'll be a little less friendly.  

At this time it was 10am, we still hadn't slept. Her phone made the notification noise. I looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: ""Lets fuck"" 

At this moment, we're both in shock. I grabbed the phone and showed her the DM. 

It was from her sisters boyfriend. 

Her:  ""maybe that's them playing around"" 
Me: ""you don't play around like that""

Her: ""it could have been my sister writing that""
Me: ""okay then, if that's what you think, let's                  call. If you're sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. If she sounds like she's just waking up, it wasn't her playing games. But if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he'll go.""
Her: ""okay""

My GF calls, Her sister answers, in a groggy voice. Like she had just woken up.

GF: ""hey what are you doing?""
Sister: ""I was sleeping what's up""
GF: ""Where's your BF?""
Sister: ""he's laying next to me""
GF: ""look at what he just sent me""
Her sister hangs up. 

We call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

When We call back, gf sister answers. In the background, we can hear that they were arguing. A few seconds later, she hangs up and we don't hear from her again for the rest of the day.


A few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. Idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. My gf believed him, but still had her doubts. I in the other hand, don't believe it for various reasons. 

My gf and I spoke about it things and she said that she'll keep her distance. Either way I let it go and decided to move on. He would continue to come around but it wasn't the same. 


Few days went by. 

Yesterday, I call her to talk and see how her day is going. She picks up, crying. She says she's at her sisters house. Her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn't breathe. I tell her to call me back asap. 

Time went by and I call to see what's going on. She picks up, i ask her what happened. She says she's home, her sister is doing fine, she's at the hospital with her parents. 

Me: ""how come you aren't at the hospital with her also?""
Her: ""they wouldn't let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and I was hungry so we left. 
Me: ""who are you with?""
Her: ""My sisters boyfriend, I told him to come instead of waiting there. ""

At this moment, I am bothered and disappointed. After all that we've been through, You're alone, in a house, with someone that you know I don't feel comfortable with. That's what I wanted to say, but did not say it bc I was on speaker. 

So we continue to talk while she starts to cook. There comes a point where her phone dies. I give her 8-10mins to call me back. (Takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). She doesn't call, so I call her. No answer. I wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. I wait longer than 5mins this time and call. She picks up and says her phone died. 

Me: ""how come you didn't call back after it died?"" (She usually does right away)
Her: ""I was on the phone with my sister, she's ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride""
Me: ""oh""

Her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. My girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

She calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. We talk about the situation, and I patiently wait for them to leave so I can talk to my gf about how I felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

When they finally leave, I express myself to her and tell her how I felt. From that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- She says that  I have no right to feel the way I felt. That's her ""brother in law"".  And that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

I tell her, that I do have the right to feel bothered. It might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. I feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. Being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. 




I'd like to know what you guys think.  Am I overreacting? Or do i have a point. 

Am I the only one that thinks it's weird?  What would you do in my shoes?

Neither of us are gay or have interest in a relationship between us. We talked, he isn't gay.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

I wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. They, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. Last Friday night I drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. That was when I created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but I didn't know how. 

I decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided I would send that. I sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". I waited, not knowing how he'd respond. Eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. So I asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on Saturday's, and he said yeah. He asked me if I was going to go, and I said probably. He responded with ""Cool! I'll be there"".

That was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. I was elated, I got so pumped up. We hung out all Saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. We didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. He then asked if I wanted to hang out Sunday too! We hung out all Sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

Then throughout this whole week while I was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. That, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. Because it showed he wanted to talk to. Eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. So that gave us a little chuckle. So we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. Now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing I have my best friend/brother back in my life. It honestly feels like I'm a different person with him being around. Thanks for all the advice!

**TL;DR - Reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**",relationship_advice
"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) invites my best friend (20F) out to games, just the two of them.","My boyfriend(lets call him J) and I have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her G) have been friends since grade school. J and G are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. They would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. However, i'm not really a sports person but still I would make the effort to attend their games. I would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. J plays football and G plays soccer.

J was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. I know its wrong to snoop but I couldn't help it. Some his teammates were messaging him and I clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging G. I got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited G out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. G would decline and tell him that he should invite me. J then said that I wouldn't understand and that I was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. G said that he is being unfair to me. J still sends multiple messages to G about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

This has been going on for months. G has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that I should watch because those are J's favorite teams.

I kinda feel betrayed by both of them. Although I feel more betrayed by J than G.

What should I do? How should I approach this?

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for your advice. I approached G first and told her that I've seen the messages. She was relieved that I came to her and talked to her about it. She explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. She also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. We both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

I also have to admit that snooping through J's messages are wrong. The reason I did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and I was feeling insecure and worried about it. But it still does not justify the way I went about it.

As for J, we will meet up later tonight. I honestly think it is over between us. He also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. I would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

Thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**UPDATE 2**: G told me that I should start by saying ""Hey, G told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and I did exactly that. J became defensive and told me that he never invited her. I told him that I saw the messages and he asked if G showed me the messages. I told him the truth that I saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. He told me that I violated his privacy and I apologized for it. Then he told me that he was asking out G because his friends felt that G was a lesbian. He was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. At this point I'm like ""WHAAAAAT?!"". He said that he was doing that to protect me and I'm like WHAT?. He then left and told me that he needed space and that I should text him after I got my head cleared up. I texted him ""stay away from me and G"". That was honestly a wild ride.",relationship_advice
"My (26M) Girlfriend (24F) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Last Vegas in January, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37M).","This has been a whirlwind of events. I am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

My GF and I have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. This all changed and I no longer know the person I once loved. Full disclosure: I have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. She has had the wool over everyones eyes.

In 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to Las Vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. Plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from Jan 11 – 14. What could go wrong.

Come Christmas time, said friend (60F) from Las Vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate Christmas in Canada. She has a son (37M). Over Christmas eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, we hung out at this families Air BNB house in our hometown and I got to know them very well. I consider myself to be very observant, and I noticed zero interaction between the son (37M) and my girlfriend (24F). After Christmas, the family flew back to Las Vegas and awaited our arrival for the January weekend.

Here is where I should have clued in, which I partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. About a week before Las Vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to Las Vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'Girls Trip.' My girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me I wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me I cannot come; Accommodations have been rearranged and I'm no longer invited on the trip. Given that I had paid for this trip, I was visibly upset. I expressed that I didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something I was invited to. Ultimately, she left the decision up to me. I decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless I was convinced she wanted me there, which I wasn't. Friday came and went, she flew with her mom, I stayed home.

My girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (The lie detector test determined that was a lie.) She stayed a few days extra and flew back. She met up with me the following Friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. I protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. Maybe one day we would get back together.

This leads us all to today. For the last month, my ex girlfriend and I have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. She has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so I thought). She and I would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. She and I both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. On valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

After struggling to move on with my life I decided today was the day I would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. By pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

I called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. Him and I got along great and he said I'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. She is in Banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. Her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""I'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. If you knew everything, I don't think you'd be here. I have been told by GF, GF mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but I have a lot of respect for you. My ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and I know how it feels. Anything you ask me, I will answer completely honestly.""

Confused, I sat down where everything had been explained to me. My girlfriend had begun an affair in Las Vegas with the son (37F) of her moms best friend. Every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to Las Vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to Banff with the whole family. Keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). I am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. I don't even know how this happened.

I cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. I feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. Suffice to say, I am in an absolute state of shock.

I simply texted her saying ""I know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. Her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

I'm completely lost reddit. I thought I was going to marry this girl one day. How does someone change in the blink of an eye. I learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than I did over the course of 3.5 years.

Where do I go from here? Advice very much welcome.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments everyone. I've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. Since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. Just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. Her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and I've been being blamed for it all. I haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. After denying what had taken place, I just assume at this point it will be more lies. She has every reason to lie about it. Whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. Thanks again everyone for the support and advice. The succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media. 

&#x200B;

**TL:DR** – My girlfriend of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Las Vegas only to cheat and carry on an affair with her family friends son. She has been lying to me ever since and has been flying down to Vegas and other cities to meet him and stay with him and his 2 kids.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"This is the link to my original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my\_21f\_boyfriends\_friend\_both\_22m\_tried\_to\_spike/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my_21f_boyfriends_friend_both_22m_tried_to_spike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

After reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. We spent most of the night there.  I told them about what I saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when I wanted to leave. They asked me lots of questions: if I am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk I was, how drunk he was, if I had ever liked him etc. It was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

The police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. They did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. I am not sure if I can do that, he has sent me a message asking how I was that I showed my boyfriend but I haven't answered him yet. I am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

After coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. We haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. So that's it for now. I don't want to have to talk to him or face him but I will have to anyway. This is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

Edit: I just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-I didn't feel the police was victim blaming, I am sorry if I made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and I did tell them everything: there is no history between me and S, we became friends through my bf and common interests and I showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. They talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say I made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. I am in a big city in Europe, I guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. The officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me I could come directly to him if I felt threatened by S.

\-I am not makng this up, I have read comments suggesting I did and it honestly hurts. I am not crazy and I never wanted things to get this messed up. This guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-My bf and I aren't telling S we went to the police. I gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but I can't do it. I also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

I am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. And I am so grateful for the support, I wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it.",relationship_advice
I (27M) found pictures of my girlfriend (23F) topless on the beach at night with strangers,"A bit of background: My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. We manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. I'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. Recently I got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. I didn't previously plan to go there, but I was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and I liked the company. She's renting a house with one male flatmate and I suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. This was all just to test the ground as I wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. She told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. Given this reaction, I didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. This made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing I couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason I wanted to move was to stay with her. I told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, I would look for jobs in other cities and go where I could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. After we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200B;

The fact: When she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. I was naturally a bit jealous but I thought she was innocently having fun. I'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago I went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. The morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. The only thing I saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. At this point I was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. We stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. She showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. All other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. She was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. I don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. I'm heartbroken since I saw that picture and I feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. I would have never expected her to do this to me, and I also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. I asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. Her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. She said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. This makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. Later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200B;

I sent her away on a train this morning and told her I want to spend my vacation alone and told her I'm considering breaking up. Right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and I held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200B;

I feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also I'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. However, it's very difficult for me to break up. Our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. Those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. However, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and I don't feel I can trust her anymore afterwards. Is there a way to recover or are we done for?

I'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. When I told her I'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that I'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&#x200B;

One additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. I want to go with her anyway. Am I being too soft? How should I handle it?",relationship_advice
(UPDATE) Brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make JW parents think I'm not gay.,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

Thank you all for your illuminating comments. I'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. But I'd like to specifically thank [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. You were exactly right.

Today we talked for the first time since our conversation. He took down the insta after our conversation (which I hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and I gently asked why, exactly, he did this. He's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""I'm being abused and need to leave the JW."" What he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). He still believes in God and wants to explore different sects of Judeo-Christianity. My hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the JW are...they're, like, ""those people"". So he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

His motive was pretty much what [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. He said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around Chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew EXACTLY where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. So in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. I told him I was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. He apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. I think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

I established myself as a lifeline. I told him that if it ever gets too much, I will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (And I mean it: I have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). He seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

As for my parents, I just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. If they ask (and this was suggested by Julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that I might have refound Christianity but I have no intentions to return to the Watch Tower, and that he stopped talking to me. Leaving JW for any reason is grounds for excommunication. And I put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. They might think I'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that I'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

And for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. No fifteen year old can act this well. He's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

Thank you all, again. My brother is back in my life, and I now have the means to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**TL;DR: My brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. I told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, I will be here for him to move in with. The insta is deleted. Thank you.**",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

I wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. It's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200B;

My ex did move out. Thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. And as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a HUGE relief. I didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. I could BREATHE again. I was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

Aaaand then I got laid off. No joke. Helluva one-two punch right there.

The past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. The year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year I had to spend recovering from that blow. I had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as I found a new job I also found out my house needed HUGELY expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, I just didn't have the cash for. And figuring out how to be on my own for a while - I had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess I was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (Bingeing 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' helped a bit.)

He also kept reaching out. For a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and I came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, I distanced myself. He messaged me once to ask if I regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if I thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. I didn't respond to that one at all. Then he'd reach out with things like ""Hey, the TV I took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? Like to sell or try and fix?"" I've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. Lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which I said that I wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (He also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. I have no words.)

&#x200B;

The good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job I got is possibly the best job I've ever had. A step down in salary, but I'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and I've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that I think I can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. I had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and I was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which I'd never done before. But I did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and I absolutely love the car.

Also - I met someone new. This person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. He treats me REALLY well. He's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. In the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. He's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and I'm not broken either, thank god. Maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. This relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and I'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200B;

And one more bit of good news - I will officially be divorced on Friday! (Yes, the day after Valentine's Day XD ) There are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200B;

I wanted to provide this update in part because I know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because I wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. It can get better. It really, really can. I'm actually HAPPY. It took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - I'm definitely going to need a LOT of time to recover financially, and I'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (A+++++ for therapy) - but I'm actually truly happy. Sometimes I wonder how much of the depression I'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight I'd been carrying for so long - his AND mine - without truly being aware of it. It's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but I'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",relationship_advice

She's lost her peripherals so bad she can't see me when she's 45 degrees facing me. She's losing her green and blue in her eyes and she's also on a list for a service dog. Her and I are very stressed about her most likely going blind within 3 years.

I've never given up easy in relationships and never will. But I'm just looking for advice to give her as she's very stressed about most likely going blind, cheers.",relationship_advice

Well, it's been like 12 days. The long and the short of it: The truth came out. Wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and I am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. I need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200B;

A lot of people said some things that really struck with me. The photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. Why would he take a picture that was so compromising? Why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? How was he so cavalier? I sat her down and demanded the whole truth. We talked the night that I posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. We went moment by moment, step by step, and I demanded to know what happened. So, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200B;

They got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. They drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. They got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. Instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. Two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *Get high.* But on what you might add? Oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. Yeah, fucking lovely. My MIL had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. They all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the MoH's surprise - a stripper. So, who took the pills *and drank?* Only my future wife. Yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. It's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. My fiancee doesn't drink, so I should have connected the dots there. That's on me I guess.

&#x200B;

The reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. Stripper never fingered her. She kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. The photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. She then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that I would leave her. She said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. She was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. Then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. I couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. I thought the pills were destroyed but I guess my fiancee didn't do that - I had no reason to assume she would lie. In the years we've been together/known each other she's drank MAYBE 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. I didn't think she'd do that.

So, that brings me to the texts. I ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. She explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that I was going to find out and leave her. Her MoH, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. Her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. By this point I didn't know what to do.

I followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. She began to panic and begged me not to. She started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever I wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. She then said she had a problem and needed help, Her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. She said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. That I don't actually doubt, I think she really does love me.

&#x200B;

So what happened?

&#x200B;

She saw her doctor on Monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. We got the name of the doctor and I guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. He recommended different types of therapy. We had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. She's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. We're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200B;

This meant that I had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. Her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. He knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. My parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. My fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. The bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. They admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. She drank way too much and they didn't stop her. I thanked them for their apology but said I didn't know what to say. They just offered their apologies and said that I was a great guy.

&#x200B;

The long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. We aren't having sex. We are right now in this weird healing phase. Her team has recommended I see individual therapy which I haven't yet had the time to do. A lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, I guess. My parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200B;

Fiancee and I are in a weird place. She's overly nice and sympathetic. Since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. She submits to drug tests and we have a BACTrack if I'm concerned she's drinking. I'm a lot more aware of what's going on. She's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. She's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200B;

I kind of feel like I got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. People keep telling me to watch out for myself, but I'm not sure what to do.

&#x200B;

So that's what happened. I'm stunned and confused. Turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. I still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. For now, I'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",relationship_advice
Final Post on: I'm a female born without a vagina. How do I tell a guy that I'm interested in about it?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

[Updated Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

I was going to make this an edit but due to its length, I figured to make it a separate post. I don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but I sincerely apologize if I am in the wrong.

I just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things I've mentioned in the comments briefly. I hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

But before I do that, I want to thank everyone who sent me a DM, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. I've read through all of them, but I haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. You have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much I appreciate it. I love you all <3

# Quick update:

I texted Kyle yesterday and he replied. I asked him how he was feeling. He said he was even more sick than earlier. I said I was too, and I said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). I told him about how I had a volunteer thing at University which I went to and how I nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. But that was it. We didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

In addition to this, I haven't called the number my TA gave me because they are only open Monday - Friday from 8am to 4pm. So, I'm going to be doing that on Monday, hopefully.

# My condition:

The exact name for my condition is Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome, or MRKH Syndrome for short. It affects 1 in every 5000 women. A lot of people, I'm assuming they were trolls, stated that I was a guy or something along those line. Just to clarify, I am a woman, I look like a woman physically and I've felt like a woman my whole life. I was genetically born with XX chromosomes. Being a woman is not something I doubt.

There are basically 2 types of branches within MRKH. Type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. Type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. This may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. I have type 1. There are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. I am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# Diagnosis:

A lot of people were confused as to why I was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did I find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

The way MKRH works is that it affects INTERNAL reproductive organs. This means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. From the outside, I look like a normal female. I have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. I am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. My ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why I am still physically able to look like a female. For me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, I have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. For 18 years of my life, I lived thinking I was just like any other girl. I never once suspected anything wrong.

When I started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. But this was around the time I started to feel like something was wrong. One main reason was that I hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that I wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. For some reason, at the time, I assumed periods and fingering went together. I thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. Its weird looking back at that now haha.

I went to the doctors one day (this was before I started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. This is probably one of the most common ways women with MRKH find out about it. The doctors simply assumed that I was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. I was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. I was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. The following year, I got my shit together on my own. I joined the wrestling team, track team, and I started doing weight training. As a result of this, I was also eating way more, and I gained a lot of muscle mass. I got my weight up to 120lbs. when I still hadn't gotten my period, I went back to the doctors. They still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. I had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. I didn't feel like everything was normal, so I switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. Needless to say, I was getting tired of blood tests because I knew they didn't show anything. One doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but I think that was circumstantial. Prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that I had breast discharge which is something I had NEVER experienced before in my life. Some how, I can't exactly remember which doctor, I ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. I diligently took the BC pills every day. Nothing happened. This is when I thought, ""Is it just me or does healthcare in Canada suck?"".

Then another doctor suggested I get a pelvic ultrasound done. This is when they found the issue. The poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. The doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. She stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom I had MRKH. She said according to the ultrasound I had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). She literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. I walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. His response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and I could hear him. And then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". I came home, and I did some googling and started to learn more about MRKH. I had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and I texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. I also added that if it changed anything between us, that I would understand, and I wouldn't hold it against him. As much as I might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something I really needed at the time.

After the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a SickKids Hospital in downtown Toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. They started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. They had me get an MRI done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an MRI. I also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). Doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. I ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because I didn't have one. The look on their face was hilarious as I'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. After I met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, I was properly informed that I did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but I was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. I was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. They had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a Q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. The depth of it was about 3mm deep. It was actually quite painful, and I hated doctors by this point anyways.

# Family Situation:

My parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are HIGHLY taboo. Everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know English well so most of the time when I went to the doctors, I went with my dad. It was very weird and awkward. The few times my dad refused to go with me, I went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

After my last appointment with SickKids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. My dad took those from me and threw them out, saying I didn't need them. They also asked if I would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that I didn't it. Going to therapy at the Hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. I can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. Taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which I don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but I don't have time due to school. I actually got a letter from the hospital in September about a pretty cool MRKH conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. I really really wanted to go. But again, it was far. I figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I could definitely bus there. The event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. It was unrealistic for me to go. So then I told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. They'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" I tried arguing that it was EXACTLY the opposite of that, and that they WANT to inform you that you ARE women despite the lack of certain organs. They responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) I had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

I had someone telling me that I need to stand up to my parents. My parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that I don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something I refuse to do. I am well aware of the shitty situation I am in. I know they are being abusive, in more than one way. I've thought long and hard about it, and I've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. I'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. I've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# Surgery:

I had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. In my first post, somewhere in the comments, I believe I said something along the lines of ""Im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why I can't get surgery yet. Lucky for me, I live in Canada and I have health insurance! Surgery is definitely an option for me. But due to my family situation, they believe that I wont need surgery until after I get married because I mean its not like I'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# Additional comments:

1. A lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that I could look into doing anal. It's all about personal preference, and I hate it. Its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. I can look into the asexual community, but I am NOT asexual. I may not be able to satisfy my needs, but I do have a pretty high sex drive, and I do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. I don't know if I would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. A lot of people had a lot to say about how I handled the situation. Some saying I did the right thing, and others saying I did it too soon. Honestly, I haven't figured out the right way to go about it. I have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. I once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""Aren't you surprised I still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" I was so taken aback by it, I didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. Someone said that ""If a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, I'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. So he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". True, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his IBS. I didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was RELEVANT to what was happening. I evaluated the situation I was in with Kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so I had to tell him. Agree or not, first date material or not, I'm going to stand by with what I did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. I am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. Its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest I do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. I don't want to publicly display it to guys I'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. I know guys who also use those dating apps, and I don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. The guy I ended up calling on Tuesday night, after I left Kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. He has told me that it wouldn't bother him. I had a lot of messages telling me that I shouldn't friend-zone him, and that I should give him a chance. Here is the real reason why I'm not attracted him nor why I would never ever give him a chance: He's basically doing nothing with his life. He's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. Whereas I on the other hand, I work part-time, I study my ass off in school, and I make time to do extra curricular stuff. I also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. But I treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. I'm not saying I'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am I saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. I'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and I'm not into that. In addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. He was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". I was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, I am. There is no way I am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. I think one of the main reasons I even turned to reddit in the first place was because I am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. Social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and I don't want them finding out. There was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me I can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications I got.

This is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. I hope I answered some questions. I really do appreciate all the support I got. Thank you, and take care everyone <3

Edit: I'm only doing this to feel better about myself: Kyle replied. ""I definitely do not want to get involved"". Fuck you, Kyle. If y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. I welcome it with open arms. 

Edit: I think I forgot to address this earlier. For those of you asking whether I can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. My clitoris is underdeveloped. Stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. Maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? I don't know. I haven't tried.

Update: Me (36M) found out that my wife (34F) was cheating on me with multiple men,"In my original post I was still unsure what to do as seen here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

But after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, I got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. I finally opened my eyes to what I had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that I would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so I decided last thursday to tell her I wanted to end this marriage.

I think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. She didn't even try to persuade me or anything. Just went like a broken record ""nothing I say will change anything"" whenever I asked her to say anything. There was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. We have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

My mother knows everything, but I for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. Maybe I'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so I agreed to give her time to tell them. When we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. Instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. They have been part of my family for almost 17 years and I care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. I felt really bad about lying to them, but I'm afraid that if I go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. But my patience is not limitless. I will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

I don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. I'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". I also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

Now there are some big loose ends to tie. We need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. The custody will be shared where I will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. I also feel like their legal address should be with me, so I won't have to pay her child support. Would be unfair after what she did. I have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. I will fight for my kids though.",relationship_advice
"Wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair","My wife died this past week unexpectedly. She was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. I thought things had hit rock bottom. She essentially died in front of me, and I was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

All things considered, I was coping as well as could be expected. Make no mistake, I was going through the expected grieving reactions. I raged and hysterically cried for days. I went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. But I have good friends and I have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

In the process of going through her belongings I discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. It looks like she started cheating during a period where I was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. After mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, I was back at a new job. However, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that I was distant to her. In the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

What more can life do to me? This man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. He appears to be the exact opposite of me. I am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. The logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but I could never have imagined this. 

I am absolutely and totally devastated. The only saving grace is that we never had children. I wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. I suppose now I know the truth of why. 

I feel like I will never be happy again. ",relationship_advice
I (26 F) used to be a prostitute. Then I met a man who became my friend (36 M) at a cafe. Now I have my GED and am a receptionist.,"I have a child with cystic fibrosis. I would watch him during the day and work at night. My sister lived with us and she would watch him at night. 

I would go to a cafe before I started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. My friend was there typing on a laptop. We started talking and I found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

I told him I never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my GED. The next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. He helped me study and I passed. 

He helped me get a job as a receptionist.  I can afford better care for my child. 

We are still friends and I have fallen in love with him. I'm not sure if he could ever like me in that way. 

Is it worth asking him if he does or Not? Or do you think that would ruin our friendship?

"FINAL UPDATE - My (24F) best friend (24F) says I owe her everything I have, including my boyfriend","Previous post

&#x200B;

I said I'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200B;

EX-BF kept trying to get in touch through common friends. They kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if I was really sure it happened. They offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so I'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. But I've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. To the ones who insisted I told them I wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, I'd block them too.

I ran into EX BF at this book thing I go to often (hobby of mine). Maybe I'm being presumptuous, but I think he went there for me. He didn't really have any business there, but I'm just speculating really. He asked if I had a few minutes for coffee, I said I was late (lie). He walked me to my car. He looked so good, smelled great. He was so sweet. Was even wearing his hair the way I like it. I fell horrible cause even after everything, I still like him. He apologized some more, said he knew I needed time and space but asked if I'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. Said he would never talk to Jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. And I just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. Which I don't. So I told him I wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. I wish I said something snappier or wittier. But I had nothing.

This was saturday, I haven't heard from him or friends since. I think that was that. 

&#x200B;

Jessie also kept trying to talk to me. Like I told some of you on comments, I had a trip coming up, it would have been me, Jessie, EX BF, and a few friends. Since Jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. She must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause I had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). She went CRAZY. Even showed up at my place (I wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). I didn't block her at first cause I admit I was having some fun watching her despair.

I talked to my mom and she was amazing. Told me I should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. So I did. And for one last bit of print screen drama: I printed all the emails I got confirming cancellations and sent those to Jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200B;

My roommate has been amazing. We were never really close and now I don't even know why. She cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200B;

A few of you suggested I see a therapist and I did, yesterday. I really liked it. It was just one appointment and I mostly just talked, but it felt good. She gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with Jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. Made me realize she was never really my friend. She was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. Therapist also told me about this saying (I think that's what it is) called ""The Narcissist's Prayer"", which goes something like ""That didn't happen. If it did, it wasn't my fault. If it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how Jessie is handling this whole thing now.

So good riddance indeed

&#x200B;

And a final piece of gossip. ""Pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. Again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said Jessie was super sure that since I broke things off, she and Dean would hook up right away. But apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. Pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. And yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, Jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (Great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

I guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. The thing is, I don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. I want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. I thin I deserve that.

I am also thinking about taking the money I got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. Haven't decided though.

Now, I think I just need time to heal and let go, you know?

My [30 M] Wife [30 F] lied to me about where she was yesterday.,"Update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

I hate that I'm having to write this but here it goes.

My wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. She mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or Starbucks if she really needs to focus. We aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

This does require quite a lot of trust as I've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. Well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

My wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. She has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

It occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was MLK day and all the library's were closed. No big deal, I figured she'd just go to a Panera or something and then head to her class. When she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. I asked her how her day went and she said ""It was good. The library was good, I got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which I liked."" I didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. While she was in the shower I decided to get on Facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

There were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

I haven't said anything to her about it yet and I can't help but suspect the worst. It is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. Anyway, I don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

Edit 1: I called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. The gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

Edit 2: So I came home for lunch after reading all the messages. Pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". So I'm torn. 

I did, while I'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnQ74Ds.jpg . There are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... And sexy red underwear. I don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... This sucks. 

Morning update: Wow... So thanks to everyone who reached out about this. It was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but I really appreciate it.

I decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who I've know practically my whole life. He was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. I haven't begun to do that yet but I will in the next few days.

Last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as Monday. Again, this is somewhat typical for her. I have a second job that I work Tuesday / Thursday and so M/W are usually her gym days. What is a little strange is the studying away from home again. She does is sometimes but it's rare and I can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. She gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

Addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""How do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". I guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place I could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. I doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. That's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. The other part is that I am going out of town this weekend, leaving Friday night and returning Sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. If she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. The gym photo. I do know the photo is from Monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the Facebook post that solidify that. I also checked their Instagram later and there were more pictures from Monday as well. However it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


I will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. I don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. I honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. That's all for now, I might update in a few weeks if anything changes. Thanks guys. 

Oh and shoutout to u/VH3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

My(24F) coworker(50F) blamed me for my miscarriage (UPDATE),"It's been a long day. First, I want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. I wasn't able to answer everyone but know I tried to read all of them. Thank you.


So, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. Now, yesterday I was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. She did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


Co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. She saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming I wasn't working. What she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'I still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him I wasn't on the application and I wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


My boss calmly assured her that I was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (I get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong I guess, doubled down and was upset I hadn't communicated that to her. I didn't even know. My boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and I guess they talked in circles for a bit. He let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. She had nothing. 


When I spoke to my boss, at this point I was upset. I finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. He was not pleased. He did let me know I don't have to explain myself and that next time if I'm in that situation to go straight to him. He offered his condolences for my loss.


As for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. Anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. Though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. She has a laundry list of people to ask before me. He told me to document everything. Anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


Today, she hasn't been around me. She even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. She hasn't said a word all day. It's been a wave of relief for me.


TLDR: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. She is now not allowed to speak to me.

I also wanted to give out my condolences and internet hugs to everyone who has shared their stories and loses as well. It truly helped me to not feel so alone.

UPDATE My (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but I feel uncomfortable,"EDIT obligatory link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgd49d/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a_massive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I added this to the original post yesterday but I felt like a lot of people who saw the original probably didn't see the update, so here it is in it's own post.

So I woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. I called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that I tell her why I was so panicked. Reluctantly I showed her my post. 

We've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. I think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

First of all, what I picked up from her. I didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although I had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so I found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. I also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

What she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

What we both learned about me is that I have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. From this to the fact that I go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because I was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). That's something that I need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though I feel uncomfortable. 

So now the all important part where I tell you the decision we came to. We decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when I feel like I've worked through the root issue enough. 

TL;DR we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when I've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.

EDIT Shout out to the people acting like not doing one sexual act is going to lead to an unfulfilling sex life for my girlfriend. You guys are the real MVPs coming to bat for my girlfriend who was actually a large hand in forming this solution. She may think she knows what she's cool with but you guys definitely know better. /s",relationship_advice
Just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from AITA,"(Deleted from AITA so reposting here.)

I met my boyfriend through a local DnD Facebook page. We started talking every day over Messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. We had a lot of stuff in common, and I thought he was really funny, and I just enjoyed his company. We started dating and we've been dating for nearly a year. We moved in together in May.

However, yesterday I found out from one of our DnD friends that he used to comment on r/Braincels . He brought it up in a ""good for him for moving on"" way but holy fuck. I only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. I managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. His last post he mentioned that he was talking to a ""foid"" and that she was actually showing interest. I think he meant me.

He was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but I don't think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. He's never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do I know he doesn't still feel that way? Would I be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? Should I give him a chance to explain? I love him and I don't know if I can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. But I also don't think I can continue to be with him knowing he things I'm not deserving of the same respect as men.

Added info from last post: he's never done anything I consider a red flag, but I also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. I feel like my trust has been breached.

"My bf's mom wants his birthday dinner to be ""family only"", as in I'm not invited. Am I wrong to feel a bit miffed?","I've been dating my bf for 3 years.  He turns 40 today.  With help from his mother....I threw him a surprise party this weekend.  His family, a few from my family and mutual friends.  The party was awesome.  Now today is his actual birthday and last week his mom mentioned we would do family dinner on the night of his actual birthday.  I reached out to her and said we could do it at our place if that was easier since our place is a bit bigger then his moms house.  She said she would get back to me.

So my bf just let me know that tonight is ""family only"" at his moms house.  Meaning myself and his sisters husband aren't invited.  Just parents and the three kids (him, sister and brother).  I dunno...I feel a little offended?  We're shopping for engagement rings right now...so I will be family.  I thought I was family.  I'm not one to make a big deal over things but this feels like a bit of a power play since I was sorta in charge of the surprise party this weekend.  Does this deserve some attention or just leave this one alone and let them have family time?

Edit: some suggested I mention that there are different languages involved.  My bf and his brother speak fluent English and Spanish, mom speaks Spanish but very good English, dad speaks Spanish but very little English, the sister speaks English, Spanish to her dad and Portuguese to her husband, the husband speaks Portuguese, some Spanish, broken English.  I'm the of bird out with just English a little Spanish. When we go out all together (minus dad) we usually converse in English but mom will switch to Spanish if she's tired or can't find the words to say something.  My bf will usually translate for me so I don't feel left out.  When dad is around it's primarily Spanish and sometimes I get translations and sometimes I don't.  I can sometimes follow a conversation if the speech is slow enough but can't really answer beyond basic words in Spanish.

UPDATE: I just got a call from my bf's mom.  Apparently when she told him in Spanish that the night would be family only he misunderstood thinking it was only the kids and parents.  She said she never meant that and was expecting the two of us.  My bf is getting a smack when he gets home. 🤦🏼‍♀️",relationship_advice
"Should I tell my(27f) little ""sister""(12f) that I'm actually her mother.","I saw the post of the 14yo kid who wanted his mother to love him and it just melted my heart. It actually made me write this. I'm in a somewhat similar situation.

I had my daughter when I was 15. I was assaulted and chose to keep the baby. My parents felt that it would be better if she was raised as my sibling rather than my child. They wanted me to go to college and get a degree. After years of therapy and hard work I have a decent job though I'm still afraid to date anyone. 

My parents died in an accident and I have full custody of her. I love her so much but she still thinks I'm her sister. It kills me when she calks me sis. I feel like I'm missing a lot. I want to tell her. But my best friend thinks that it would only complicate things and she cannot handle such sensitive info at her age. What do I do?? 

Thanks for listening to me and thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses and messages. I will be contacting a therapist like everyone asked me to and tell her after preparing her mentally.

I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"A few days ago, my girlfriend and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary. I was planning on proposing at dinner (had the ring and everything), but the day before she told me she's pregnant. It seems her IUD failed, which is unfortunate, but we are at a position in our lives where we can handle a child, and I'm ready to support her through pregnancy and become a father.

We had discussed the possibility of kids in the past, and after discussing this recent revelation we'd be happy to bring this child into the world. I just don't know when I should propose, I'm worried it would seem like a shotgun marriage. Should I try and explain I've been planning on this for months already and that it's not spur of the moment, or should I wait a bit longer? I absolutely intend to marry her, but this could not have been worse timing, it feels like everything has become much more complicated now.",relationship_advice
I [23F] caught my younger siblings having sex while my mom was away on a short vacation with my aunt. I don't know if I should and how I should tell her,"I'm [23F] and I live with my mom still, I also have 2 other siblings [19F] and [17M] who live with my mom too. My dad isn't around  (he passed away 10 years ago) and it has just been my mom and us 3. I am working already, while my sister is in college and working part time, then my little brother is in his last year of high school.

My mom has a good job, earns a lot of money, and we works really hard. It's been years since she has really had a break and her boss told her to take a week off since she had paid for a week long trip to a resort that isn't very far. She went with my aunt whom she's super close with and another friend  who we have known for years.

Obviously we are all old enough to take car of ourselves for a few days and we are all responsible. So my mom left. I would come home from work as normal, and go out with friends or just stay at home. One if the nights, I came back home pretty late, around 12 at night which usually I would already be home asleep by 9 or 10.

I heard them and saw them in my brother's room having sex. I am completely sure that it was both of them. I was about to freak out on them but then again it'a the two of them against me and I don't know if my mom would believe them and think I'm crazy or believe me so I just took it calm and tried to go to sleep. 

It's been a few days since my mom got back, I haven't said anything, and I feel kind of icky when I talk with or see my siblings. I want to tell my mom but I don't know how to do it without her freaking out on me or her thinking I'm lying? Should I just ignore the whole situation instead?

First off- stop pming me making white racial jokes, we are not white, we are latino/a.

Second off- I'm not giving away any personal information.

Third-I make spellung and grammar errors because my family's native language is spanish not english and I am also using reddit on my phone

"My [16F] Mom [36F] acts ""competitively"" around me since I lost weight.","Hi reddit, 


So this is a weird one probably, I've always been a quite chubby child, but around a year and a half ago I've decided to do something about that and started working out and doing other sports, I'm playing Volleyball and I'm in my high schools cheerleading team. 

Around like 8 months ago my mom has started acting like I'm some sort of ""threat"" to her relationship with my stepdad [41M].

Yes, I've catched my stepdad staring at me few times and I think that's kinda gross but I had hoped she would talk to him about that, but instead she is mad at me.


At first she started teasing me with the fact that I'm lesbian, something she never really had an issue with before, said that I'm still the ""chubby"" girl and other mean things. 

Over time it has only gotten worse to the point where there are some serious restrictions on what I'm allowed to wear. For example, we've a pool, she absolutely doesn't want me to go swimming in it, because she doesn't want me to walk around in a swimsuit or a bikini. 

I'm not allowed to wear my gym clothes or any form of leggings, skirts or dresses or even my cheerleading outfit. 

At multiple occasions she has tried to hide or throw away clothes or make-up. Including Lululemons I've paid for with my own money. 

She always asks me when I'm getting a haircut again and tries to pressure me into my old short hairstyle by saying how unattractive my longer hair looks. (Fun fact: We are both blonde and have similar hair lengths)

(Final update) My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tried to gaslight me into getting plastic surgery.,"This is going to be the last post I make about this situation. I want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses so I felt as though I needed to say at least something on the matter. 

A lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and I appreciate that more than I can say. To those of you calling me an idiot or saying I was making excuses for him - I wasn't. Evidently I knew his actions were wrong, otherwise I wouldn't have made the post to begin with. I clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. He's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when I've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. Of course I knew that his actions in my post were wrong, I was trying to stress that he is not normally like this & that he was not aggressive with me. This is a man that I felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. He protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when I was alone and distraught on some random beach! Of course he had my complete trust.

Anyway.

Following my last post, I basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. In doing so, one of them (lets call her Daisy) brought me to the realisation that I was never THAT insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. It sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. I rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me SO pissed. Then there was the icing on the cake - TWO of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to Lucy's party (no shit) but Lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? She's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. Great! I guess I'm fucking blind.

That really was the final straw for me. So last night when I saw him, I asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or Lucy's. Again, he said mine. I told him that I'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. He seemed bothered that I had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point I lost my temper. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. It wasn't even a good lie. 

We had a pretty rough argument and I brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. I cried a lot. He kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

But yeah. I'll spare the gory details. I did try to break up with him but I don't think it sunk in. As far as I'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. I'm sure he will soon. I've blocked him on everything and I'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as I would like. I'm done with this though. He dominated so much of my life and I'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. Apparently he was weird about Lucy even when he was with his ex, so I think I might talk to her about the situation. 

I wanna keep moving forward. I need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. When we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and I thought that was strange. At the time I thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. I had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. I already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly I've overcome worse.

I'll be fine.

Update: My [20/M] girlfriend [19/F] has an incest fetish and wants me to pretend that she's my sister during sex,"Original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bj0hpb/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_has_an_incest_fetish_and/

After reading the comments in the original thread, it really made me wonder if she was intentionally trying to look like my sister for the sake of her fetish. It never crossed my mind after she admitted her fetish to me until I read the comments. The thought of that made me even more uncomfortable than before, so I decided to question her intentions.

I sat her down again and asked her if copying my sister's look was part of her fetish. She said she was really embarrassed but admitted to me that it was. I told her thank you for being honest with me, but that I am really weirded out by it. She said she understands why it weirds me out and apologized for not telling me sooner.

After she apologized, I told her that I'm okay with her fetish and that I'm willing to try roleplaying with her, however there will be conditions for it. My conditions are that she changes her makeup style and dyes her hair a different color, or goes back to her natural color, so that I don't feel like I'm having sex with my actual sister. She agreed without any hesitation and said that it was fair for the both of us, thankfully.

Since that conversation, she has dyed her hair back and has started learning different makeup styles independently from my sister. We haven't tried the roleplaying thing out yet, but I feel comfortable with the idea of it now, So I don't think it will be a problem.",relationship_advice

I [23m] unknowingly outbid my GF [26] on eBay on a present for her. Should I tell her I was the other bidder or keep hush?,"Hi Reddit,

Glad to be posting something that isn't cheating or something fucked up.

My GF and I really love this particular band, I always keep an eye out for cool/rare merch to get a little 'anytime' gift for each-other.

Cue last week. Her birthday is coming up and I found a rare version of a Vinyl on eBay for waaaay under market price. I instantly bid on it and day later someone bids back, I end up in a little bidding war with this randomer and eventually win. The next day my GF and I are chatting and she begins to tell me that she had found this really cool rare bit of merch but got out bid and she really wanted it for our collection. That's when it hits me, I was bidding against her.

Now, normally I would've just told her it was me and we would've got a good giggle out of it, but considering I was buying it as a surprise (birthday) I kept quiet. However now I'm starting to think I should just tell her as she's pretty bummed out about it (May seem silly to some but its a really important thing to us)

Reddit, should I just own up and tell her or wait a week and a half for the big reveal then?

Am I shallow for wanting a guy with a decent job?,"Nowadays it seems like most of the men I meet aren't doing much with their lives. They seem to not want to go to school which is fine, but don't want to ""work for someone"" either. They want to own their own businesses but they don't seem to want to put in the work. My last boyfriend went to school but never finished and ended up working in the mall. The guy I met at the grocery store was an up and coming rapper, but we're both 29 and I think it's time for him to be more realistic. Yesterday I went on a date with this guy my friend set me up with and he works at Walmart. I asked him what his goals were and he said he's living in the moment. I asked him if he wanted to work at Walmart forever and he got offended and told me if I'm a gold digger then I came to the wrong place. My friend heard of this and said I'm too picky. I don't want someone swimming in money, I just want you to not live paycheck to paycheck. It feels like women are more successful than men these days and we seem to work harder. Am I honestly being too picky or what? Would you guys be ok with dating a person that was ok with living the struggle life when they didn't have to?",relationship_advice
"I [M61] just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars.","UPDATE: a little long but this is where we are now

I want to thank all those that responded, it was a tremendous help. I wrote my post last night, couldn't sleep and didn't have any direction to proceed. Based on your feedback, all of her credit cards have been cut up. She has committed to paying the debt off, and has established some favorable job interviews on Monday, one related to teaching, another as sexual assault nurse examiner. After going through the finances again the total debt is 112,000. The interest is 19 to 20%, and she was only paying the minimum and not paying much on the principal. I have contacted my financial advisor and will meet with him on Tuesday, he understands the issue and we will pick the right option for consolidating the debt. She is losing authorization to our bank account and all of her spending will go through me. She is not on drugs or gambling, the money was spent mostly on clothes. After our son was born, she was a stay at home mom until he went to 1st grade. During this timeframe is when she started the spending. Her weight was up and she had very little to do, and her self esteem was low and she got credit cards in her name (only) and started buying. She thought she would pay debt off after getting a job, but the whole situation spiral out of control. I was traveling a lot for work and she was handling the finances. This was hidden until I discovered it last night. I feel we can recover financially but depends mostly on her. I was criticized for making her tell her parents what she did. We are in a small town in the deep south and family is important. My parents are not alive, and I needed her parents for support and getting her on the right path. She is an addict, and although this shamed her, she has to hit rock bottom and understand the damage she did to our family. This is the only way to recover. I met with her mother today and requested help in building her back up and not let her fall in depression or self pity. We are scheduled for couple counseling this Monday and hopefully we can start repairing trust in our relationship. Any additional input is greatly appreciated, but that's for all the input.



First time posting, need help on what I should do.  I [M61) just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars. I have just retired after 35 years of working as an Engineer and was unaware she was spending money out of control. Since retiring, I'm more involved with the budget and found these unexplained charges in our bank account. When confronted she only told me of 3 of the six that were lower debt totaling 20,000. I dug further into our finances and made her show me her accounts with monthly charges and found more, the total was 103,000. She broke down completely crying and begging me to forgive her. She is an RN but hasn't worked for about 6 years. We have one son that recently graduated from high school, now attending 1st year of college. She was extremely involved with his school activities and functions, volunteering many hours, appearing as the perfect mom to the community. Still don't know what she bought with all the money, but believe it was buying clothing and other junk for her and my son, but mostly her, over a 10 year period. I made about 160,000/year so don't understand how she spent the income and generated this extreme debt. My current retirement income cannot cover these credit debts and I'm not willing to tap into my son's college fund or 401k fund. She has committed to finding a job and paying off all the debt by herself, but I feel I have been completely betrayed and have loss my trust in her. I told her this is a game breaker for our marriage and now wondering if I should be seeing a lawyer. She says she loves me extremely and beg me not to leave and that she will fix this mistake herself and it's her problem not mine. I feel she means it, but might be more concerned about finding out. Based on her personality she would be extremely embarrassed if people found out what she did. I made her call her parents and tell them what's she had done. She respects them tremendously and has always been seen as the perfect mother that did no wrong. I still love her, and both of us, love our son and don't want to split up. Need help on what to do any insights or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I think how its the right thing to do as to not lead her on any further and how i dont really care if we break up. maybe it how she acts and what she says that turns me off, but nothing comes to mind that would make me think this way.

[Update] Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"A lot of people seem to care and I got a ton of encouraging messages, so I will post an update for you.

We live in northern Europe, for those that asked.

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8kusg/wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out_of_a/)

&#x200B;

Thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. A lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare Capgras delusion. Some of you assumed she was cheating which is something I won't even address.

Thinking about it, Capgras really fitted the symptoms but I couldn't just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and I just overreacted.

After they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. The psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. They told me they will look after her and I should go home to my children. I felt like i was drunk the entire time, I couldn't close a single eye at night.

The psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. I left my children with their grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

She told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its Capgras. She never saw a case of Capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. She explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

My wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. She was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. She calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. The good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. She 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. She assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. She flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. She still isn't sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. That explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. My wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren't real because she didn't feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. Writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest.

She also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren't the real 'we'. Her delusion that we've been swapped came to her 1 day before I noticed it. 10 days ago. She woke up, looked at me and knew that I wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. Same with the kids, her parents and her friends. She hadn't had those thoughts before.

She asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. She tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn't sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. My wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she's ok being here. It gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. It helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot.

The psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. She explained to me that it's possible that she might never truly recover. But the fact that she opened up about it and doesn't necessarily feel scared is a good sign. Im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. She apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. She knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. Only the thought that we aren't the real ones is now a fact for her. Now I wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

Writing all of this down really helped me. I'm trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. I can't hide how distressed I am and that my wife isn't at home so I explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. The 4yo doesn't really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. It helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. They asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. I havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

Thanks to everyone here that helped me. I feel like im in a waiting room at the dentist. Its so surreal. I feel better knowing what the problem is, but worse not knowing when it ends.",relationship_advice
BF won't leave my scars alone and keeps bringing up things I've asked him not to. I finally snapped about it and he says I should be grateful.,"Some context first:

I'm(F) 19 this year, my partner(M) is 21. We've been together for about 6 months.
I've got minor-medium facial scarring on the left side of my face, and I have a prosthetic eye. Short story short wear bike helmets and don't be a fucking idiot when you're with your friends.

Alright, my boyfriend has been with me for 6 months now, and for the most part, we get along well. Now I'm gonna admit, my temper needs work because I can be snappy sometimes but I've made clear from the start that I don't want to talk about my scars nor have them be touched etc. It makes me uncomfortable and generally ruins any good mood in the situation. 

My issue is he keeps doing things like touching them with his fingers and calling me beautiful as if I want reassurance about the most fucking horrible thing about me. I try to be nice about it, but I just can't make it clear enough how much I hate it. He also makes comments about how I should get some stupid weird looking prosthetic with patterns and stuff and he doesn't get that I just want to look normal, I just want to be allowed to forget about that stuff as much as possible. 

I guess the problem is he doesn't get just how serious it is to me and that making light hearted jokes about it just makes me feel like I'm different and I hate it. I already have stupid questions from people who don't know me well that make me feel insecure, but he knows me and has been told.

I snapped about it last night and he went off saying that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and I should be grateful he's trying. Was I being unfair? I feel like it's okay for me to ask him to leave that part of me and my life alone so I can move on as best as possible but apparently not.",relationship_advice
I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. How should I fix this situation?,"My (now deceased) ex-wife and I have 5 kids together: 21F, 24F, 28M, 30M, 35M.

A few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. Over 300K GBP each, evenly distributed among them.

Prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. It was to: 1. Used to pay off debt, 2. Used to further education, 3. Put towards buying a house in future.

Two of my kids, 24F and 28M, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. My daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. I completely understand going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** Bloody shameful.

My son is even worse. He has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. None of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

So I continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. Once this happened, I decided to cut them both out of my will, as I don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

I told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when I eventually pass. One of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed I'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

I don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if I'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

Any advice on how to fix this?",relationship_advice
My (21M) friend (21F) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man.,"Me and my friend are both from India. We recently graduated from our college and were planning to get a good job. She is from a very underdeveloped village and was given scholarship by the government to study. Her parents are socially backward and never contributed for her well being and were against of her education from start. Her mom is abusive and her father is an alcoholic. She is the only one in her family to graduate. Her sister dropped out of the school and works as a part time maidservant. The one who supported her through tough times is her aunt. Her aunt fought with her parents and supported her through graduation, but she later passed away last december. Now that her aunt is out of the way her parents are trying to claim her as their own. Her parents are forcing her to marry a 43 year-old for their personal gain. Basically this man is ready to offer her parents three lakhs rupees ( roughly 4354 USD) in exchange of their daughter. The man in question is very shady. He has many lawsuits filed over him and is potentially connected with the local gang members. He is avoiding his jail time because of his political connections and power. He is already married to two women 41F and 32F and has four children, eldest being a 19 year old boy.

My friend do not know what to do. She cried yesterday while being with our other friends. We are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. But she is too scared to take any actions.

If the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. She will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

My best friend (F24) became a widow three months ago and is acting like she's never been married,"My best friend, let's call her Elisa, is a 24 years-old engineer who got married two years ago to her first and only boyfriend, both were high school sweethearts.

Last week, a guy flirted with her during one of her classes (she's doing her masters degree) and, even though she said she's not interested, she said she would love to get married someday. She was deeply in love with her late husband and I'm not sure if she's dealing with her grief in a healthy way.

My(M36) wife (F43) thinks I couldn't be attracted to her and therapist agreed?,"Background:

Married a little over two years, after dating a very short time around 3 months. 

We meet at a work event and I was immediately smitten with my wife. It was like out of a movie I saw her chatting with a group of people and in my head I heard ""oh there she is"". She was newly devorced and took some convincing on my part but we have been together from that night on and get along extremely well.

Now for clarity I am extreamly attracted to my wife, we may just still be in the honeymoon stage but I've never felt this way about another women. And becasue it's pertains to the conversation we had today with her therapist I would say the majority of the population would find her attractive and not in a niche way. She is objectively attractive. I feel we are evenly matched in looks, very few people have notice the slight age difference. She however wins in personality (outgoing and charming) and she makes about 3X as much money as I do. 

A couple months ago we ran into an ex of mine, and by ex we literally dated for maybe a month and never exclusive. After my wife mentioned how different they were (age/hair color/body type etc) and it ended in a pretty heated argument. We have had 3/4 conversations since, all of which I was trying to convince my wife I'm not going to leave her for a women I ""dated"" years ago. 

Last week she asked if I would go to her therapist with her today and I agreed. She has been seeing her for about 8 years for anxiety and a bout of depression that happed before we meet.

Today:

Started normal enough and I had figured why we were there so I just jumped into it thinking the therapist would be on my side and would help me calm my wife's fears. That's not what happed.

The therapist did very little talking although their long silences and knowing glances started to piss me off right away.

The thing that stood out to me the most was how my wife reiterated how she doesn't see how I would be attracted to her and the therapist didn't even disagree. Like I felt like a crazy person, my wife is beautiful, charming, funny, it feels like I wished her into existence.

She brought up the age difference (7 years?!?), my looks, and how quickly I wanted to get married as all reasons for why I am basically a gold digger. 

First off we both wanted to get married quickly, I asked and figured she would want a long engagement but she didn't so we got married. Second I never even discussed money with her until after we were married and never dreamed she made so much more than I do. She said she doesn't think I'm after her money but enjoy the lifestyle while I'm with her and it makes it easier to pretend I'm attracted to her. Sorry more attracted to her, like I play it up. 

I'm completely blind sided and don't really want to talk to my family or friends, it's humiliating being accused of marrying someone for a lifestyle.

For clarity: I moved into her house, I rent out my old home but that income just covers the mortgage and the company that manages it. All our money goes into a joint checking with automatic transfers into savings etc. Our bills are paid from that account, I looked at our bank account and I spend significantly less than she does each month on average. 

After leaving I'm in a complete panic that she is going to leave me, even though I feel humiliated and love her so much. I immediately wanted to offer to sign a prenup or separate bank accounts or both but I just froze.

My wife seem so sad and I'm so frustrated, I didn't even do anything wrong. The women I've dated in my past don't have a similar type and to be honest I didn't really date, more like hook up for a few months then moved on. I love my wife, she is the first women I have ever met that I have had a real partnership with, like we were a team and now that's all gone. 

I don't feel like I have the strength to leave her, it scares me that I can't even envision a scenario where I would leave. She is my most favorite person.

How do I rebuild trust when I don't feel I ever did anything to lose it. 


Edit: My wife didn't come home last night but I texted her this morning. First apologizing for leaving the session and then asking her to come home so we could formulate a plan. No word back yet but I doubt she will check her phone before lunch if she went to work. 

Thanks for letting me vent, I've already asked my insurance company to send a list of counselors for me to call later today. Hopefully I will find a good fit as I don't even know how to go about picking one.

Edit 2: I need a referral from my general doctor before insurance will cover a therapist/psychologist, I have an emergency phone appointment Monday and will being seeing someone by myself.

My wife didn't return my text but did come home about an hour later. Honestly I cried for the first time in a long time, but was able to get across how seriously I take her concerns. I haven't mentioned anything about her therapist or my feelings about things just apologized and asked for another chance to hear her out completely.

She said she was really drained and is taking a nap, I don't think she made it in to work and am actually looking forward to having the weekend to talk. I'm not going to ask for couples counseling until I talk to my own therapist. 

This is probably it unless I fuck things up this weekend. Thanks for letting me type out my feelings and being honest even the hard comments were helpful.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (48 M) don't know how to be a dad to a child (1 year M) I never wanted.,"While it's only been a few days since I posted I think I've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. I've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. I had a lot to process. A lot to figure out. I believe I was in a bit of a panic when I posted. I feel calmer now since reading each and every comment.

I know now more than ever that I was never meant to be a dad. I certainly never wanted to be dad. Yet here I am, a dad. That will never change. My son is here and he needs me more than I need the life I'd originally planned for myself. He needs me.

Admittedly I've been a very hands off father. Not truly involved nor invested. If anything I was peeking through the window of fatherhood. Or better put, having one foot in the door and the other out. Neither here nor there. Mostly watching from afar.

I think my fear of him and what he represented in my mind drove me away from him. It made me avoid him so I could avoid the overwhelming feeling of ""what have I done"" and ""my life is over."" I think avoidance made things fester, made my fear and dread grow, and that painted a dark cloud over everything.

Still, I feel heavy weight of loathing for the future and I mourn for the life I wanted, even if it is selfish. I realize these feelings they need to go. I need to move on. Grieve in a sense and push forward and forget how things could have been. They simply are not and will never be.

I sent my wife away yesterday so I could spend the day with my son. My first day alone with him. Maybe that's pathetic. Maybe I'm a terrible man. Maybe I'm a terrible husband. Definitely an awful dad.

I wanted to experience him in a way I hadn't before. Alone without being able to hand him over when he frustrated me or I was bored. 

Honestly the day went shit. We both had a tough time. He wanted mom and so did I. There was this moment though when I sang to him ""I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas"" and he laughed so damn hard. I've never made him laugh like that before. It wasn't miraculous or revolutionary but I did feel this little spark inside me. This little ""I want to do that again"" sort of feeling.

I've done what a lot of you have told me and I've reached out to a few therapists. I have an appointment for next week and currently waiting to hear back from two others. I want to shop around and find a good fit since I know I need this. I feel ashamed admitting such a thing. I feel embarrassed. I for some reason even feel emasculated too. 

There are also a lot of unpleasant things I feel when I look at my son. What I've utterly failed to take into account is what I see, which is the epitome of innocence. From that I learned that I need to seperate my feelings from him. Whatever negativity I feel is not his doing, that is all me and my fears surrounding him. He is not the source of my feelings. He is a trigger and I need to fix that.

My son is innocent and he needs me. This is the truth.

I'm not leaving. I've resolutely decided that I'm not leaving. I'm never leaving. I need to pack up that fantasy and put it out of my mind. My wife needs me. My son needs me more. He needs me. He needs me. He needs me. I keep telling myself this. He needs me. He needs a dad. I have to be all in because in the long run being all out seems like such a worse fate for all involved.

I want to touch on a few things before I wrap this up...

Saying I love my wife is a profound understatement. She is all my hopes and dreams rolled into a package of femininity and determination. I married her for the long haul not just until things didn't go my way. Nowhere in my vows did it say if we accidentally create a child everything we've gone through is null and void, my love will disappear and I'm out. 

Some people said she betrayed me. I've never felt betrayed. The baby wasn't planned. We even took steps to terminate but her heart said no and I respect that. I respect her and I respect her choice. She made the decision she could live with.  Unless you or your spouse has been pregnant and you've considered all your options your opinion really isn't relevant. Watching my wife go through the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones while battling with not only her desires but mine... It wasn't an easy decision for her. She didn't just suddenly decide she wanted a baby. She agonized over the decision.

The child is mine. Some called that into question. He is mine. There are personal factors that I don't want to get into, but I know without a doubt he is mine. And, yes, I have since gotten a vasectomy. I'd attempted twice in the past and was denied. They were hesitant because I was young and childless, then it was because my wife was still young and we were childless. Maybe I could have better searched for doctors but in the end we chose to go with an IUD.

As to where to go from here? Well, I'm a dad now. I have been for a year. There's no changing that. I must learn how to be a good one. My son needs me. I've ordered some parenting books for fathers. I've been researching some groups to join for fathers as well. I've also been contemplating cutting my hours at work. I typically work 10-12 hour days. I don't think that's feasible anymore. I'm a dad now and my son needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me.",relationship_advice
My (17M) twin sister (17F) has been sleeping in my bed with me,"We're fraternal (obviously) and we've always been really close. Her boyfriend unexpectedly died in an accident about two weeks ago, which has made her so sad that she can barely function.

The day after he died, she knocked on my door at like 3 AM. When I told her to come in, all she said was ""I can't be alone in my room for one more second"". Then she climbed onto my bed, got under the sheets, and went to sleep. I didn't protest or say anything, I just let her do what she wanted.

After that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. It was the same situation each time. She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed and go to sleep. Sometimes she'd say something like ""talk about anything to distract me until I fall asleep"". She doesn't sleep in my room every night anymore, but she does it every few nights. She did it two nights ago and I'm pretty sure she'll do it again.

I have a king sized bed so it's not like she's too close to me or anything, we don't even touch all night and it doesn't really make me uncomfortable, but I'm just wondering if this is normal for someone who's grieving. Also, should I tell my parents? She asked me not to but I don't know what to do

My boyfriend hit me in a fight. Is this who he is? [UPDATE],"Last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djf9pq/my_boyfriend_hit_me_during_an_argument_is_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I greatly appreciate the support that I received on my initial post. Some of you asked me to update and I've decided that I would. 

There was a lot of concern about the possibility that I might have broken ribs from the assault. Upon going to the doctor and getting x-rays, I found out that while I suffered no breaks, he did bruise my ribs. Essentially I was told to rest and it should improve within 4-6 weeks. It still hurts to do just about anything involving movement. Deep breaths feel like a knife in my side. I'm tempted to get a second opinion if it continues being this bad. My doctor didn't ask many questions about how I obtained my injures. I told him that I had a fall and he seemed to accept that story. 

I told my family what had happened shortly after going to the doctor. They came the following day to move me out of our flat. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever done, but I am grateful to have them to get me through everyday. My parents were just as shocked as I was to learn that my ex boyfriend was capable of something so awful. They have urged me to file a report despite my decision not to. I do not want to go through that process. It's been a terrible ordeal that I want in the past. If I'm honest perhaps there might be some loyalty to him inside me that doesn't want him in jail. We have taken photos of my injuries and saved texts (I'll get to that momentarily) should I need them in the future.

We explained the situation to my former landlord who was unexpectedly sympathetic. She let us break our lease without excess penalty other than keeping the deposit. 

My ex boyfriend had been trying to get in contact with me from the day I asked him to leave. Endless phone calls and text messages that I never answered. His texts included apologies as well as promises to get help. I ended up calling him to tell him that I had moved out. To my surprise he didn't fight me. He agreed that it was for the best though he was clearly heartbroken. We have both completely moved now and I have no intention on contacting him further. 
 
I'm trying to be strong, but in my darkest moments I miss him. I miss my life. I miss waking up to and going to bed with my best friend. I miss talking to him. I miss the love we had for 3 years. I miss the person that I used to be; confident and brave. I'm fucking scared all the time now. I'm scared that I'll never be able to trust anyone in the same way I trusted him. I miss not being in pain. I'm angry at him for ruining everything and angry at myself for not seeing the signs. I alternate between being in utter denial to despair. This has been the worst experience of my life that sometimes feels like it's impossible I'll ever smile again. 

Don't worry about me taking him back. Telling my family cemented that that will never happen. As for the rest of it, I don't know. 

Forgive me for any grammatical errors. Thank you for any supportive comments.",relationship_advice
"My brother molested my girlfriend's niece and everything is as bad as you can imagine, I don't know what to do at this point?","Yes, he's in prison and will be for a long time. Meanwhile the niece is receiving therapy. English is not my first language so please bare with me.

For context my brother is a lot older than me and we never really connected, yet he was/is a mama's boy and our mother encouraged us to see each other. I obliged because our mother started developing Parkinson's disease and I didn't want her upset over her darling boy and second son not talking. I've always known my brother to really like chatting up women and people called him a 'sex pest' 'creep' or a wannabe 'lady's man' yet never in a million years did I think he would have a thing for or do anything to children. People still believe he is innocent. Another thing to mention my brother is a very confident person, calculated, and manipulative, very few people can tell he's lying.

With my gf we dated for a year, moved in together and had a generally normal relationship. My brother of course tried to hit on her multiple times and she brushed him off then told me which caused major strain with me, my brother, and mother. Especially because my brother and mother tried blaming my gf, yet I know what my brother is like and my mother is in denial about it. For a period of time I banned him away from our house. However later my gf's sister, BIL, and niece came to stay because her sister was pregnant with the second child and we were discussing leaving the niece at our place because the baby was going to require surgery and a hospital stay after birth that could last up to a month.

We decided to keep my gf's niece with us for the time especially so the niece could stay with her aunt. My gf and niece are fairly close so we thought it was a good idea especially with the baby while both parents were stressed and worried. Then my POS brother had to fuck it up like the cunt he is. My mother started hounding me over allowing my gf's family over but not allowing my brother over so I obliged under heavy supervision he was around. My brother was being mysteriously nice and well behaved, he also was buying us things, playing games with the niece so she actually did like him and was excited when he was around.

My brother then decided he was a handy man and helped with minor adjustments to the house, he would find excuse after excuse to come over to the point I was finding it partly daunting. My gf just ignored him and I didn't realise he was losing interest in my gf at time. When everything came out the signs became clear mainly after what occurred. In a very short period of time my gf's niece started becoming sad which we thought was because she was missing her parents so we bought her lots of toys, read to her, took her on trips to beach, zoo, shows, let her stay up, watch her favourite shows, and so on trying to make everything fun as possible. What we didn't notice was my brother was sometimes alone with her for very short periods of time which he used to his advantage.

It all come out when my gf noticed her niece was oddly quiet in the bath her niece is usually singing and splashing in the water, (my girlfriend went into the kitchen to get a cup or something it was only a few minutes), my brother was meant to be outside helping in the garden, I was in the garage when I heard screaming. I ran inside and my gf was beating up my brother who was trying to restrain her. I held onto him and my gf grabbed my niece and locked them in a room then called the police. My brother was saying he didn't do anything and ""accidentally"" walked in on the niece then my GF attacked hence I knew immediately he was lying. The police arrived and arrested him.

We found out my brother was actively grooming the niece then started getting physical with kissing and inappropriate touching, then my GF found him molesting her niece in the bath tub. He would use whatever minimal time he had to get to her, sometimes the amount of time he used was so brief it was like he was enjoying the thrill of possibly getting caught. With the bathtub incident he was meant to be outside and like the snake he is he waited for an opportunity to strike. It wasn't like the niece was left alone for hours on end, the door was left open so my gf could hear her while she went to get something then comeback. The niece is in primary school and can be left alone for brief periods of time. No one thought he would be doing this.

When we went to court several women came forward about sexual harassment from him, he would target women in his workplace or close by him with behaviour that he could try excuse, he was a peeping tom, and he would target women when they're drunk offering a ride home or something. It literally came off as a game to him where he pushed boundaries and limits to see what he could get away with. Shockingly he apparently developed a form of humanity and admitted to what he did to the niece saying he has never done anything to a child prior and wanted see what it would be like. Just a horrible person. 

My mother refuses to believe he did it and I went no contact with her because I'm honestly sick of her shit. I later remembered when my brother and I were children he was the golden boy and she paraded him around like an item, he could do nothing wrong and never had consequences for his actions. It's also the main reason our parents divorced because she refused to see what she was raising and wouldn't allow our father to get him therapy. I'm pretty sure she's a narcissist who raised a sociopath. I had moved in with our dad after the divorce because I hated the pair of them and before our dad died in my 20s, he told me how our relatives would always talk about how lovely and kind I am yet say they would 'keep an eye' on my brother while my dad said no matter what he did he couldn't feel love for or from my brother as if it was just missing from him. That of course scared me yet 15 years+ later when I'm in my 30s and my brother is almost 50 years old it was sort of lost on me.

Now with the relationship with my girlfriend. We have been sleeping in different rooms with limited talking. Her family basically blames me and my entire family and to some degree my GF. My gf told me she cannot face her sister because she feels as if she failed her family and ruined her niece's life when it's my POS brother's fault. I feel as if I ruined my GFs and her niece's life because of what my brother did. I'm trying to get us both into counselling/therapy while my gf has requested leave off work and I am preparing to too. After everything was said and done with my brother in prison, being home is utterly horrible and I have no idea what to do to even slightly repair this. This is the first time I've cried in years and I feel terrible for my GF's niece, gf, and GF's family. I do not know what to do next, I also keep wishing I terminated my brother when I had the chance. I have never hated anyone more in my life while I think my mother should be locked up with him.",relationship_advice
FWB told me I don't taste good,"A couple of weeks ago I was giving my fwb a blowjob and he suggested we 69 which I had never done before. A couple of seconds after we started he pushed me away from him and told me I didn't taste good. My self-esteem was honestly crushed because that has always been my biggest fear. I've had multiple partners in the past and it has never been an issue. I get tested frequently so I know I'm clean. I also try to eat pretty healthy. I don't understand what the problem was but I have not been able to stop thinking about it. My sex drive has plummeted and I don't know if I'll ever be open to receiving oral sex again. After he said that I got extremely upset and stormed out. He followed me and wouldn't let me leave until we talked. He said that he believes ""honesty is the best policy and that no one can handle real honesty these days."" Part of me thinks he has a point. I do want someone to be honest with me but should there be a limit?? It's humiliating to even post this but it has been eating at me and I want others' opinions on it.",relationship_advice
Update to my husband wants a white name,"Not really sure if anyone is interested but we talked it out

He felt like the baby would look 100% like me and nothing like him and he was feeling left out. He said she wouldn't feel like his baby if she looked completely like me and had a name that I chose and that he had no part in. That's it. He's not racist or disgusting and doesn't want an arab baby. So I reassured him that we have no idea how she'd even look. But I know what he means. He really had to accommodate all these years which I am so so appreciative of, he did not have to do that, he could have taken the easy way out and dumped me for someone that didn't require so much effort. But he learned to love our foods and learned literally 5 words of Arabic to show my family and impress them with lol

And he's not racist at all, he is an amazing guy and I'm so lucky to be with him. 

So we're gonna find our names together. If we both agree on an ""American"" name, it's fine. She really is gonna be surrounded by her arab heritage so much with our big family and everything, if a name helps him feel more connected to our baby, it's all his. 

He apologized for dissing hummus and for acting a little childish and I apologized for being controlling and not taking his feelings and own culture into account. But we are fine, we are all made up now and I love him :)",relationship_advice
Update - My (20M) FWB (26F) got pregnant. Kinda freaking out.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d9p7sy/_/

Update to this post.

The comments helped me calm down a little, I really needed that. I was really stressing tf out. And yeah I know I'm stupid, didn't really think my actions through.. I did went back to her soon after my post and well, we cried hah. We've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. So she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what I wanted before making a decision. And well yeah, I pretty much realized I don't know why we're NOT dating.. Lots of common interests. Always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. Good chemistry in general. But I honestly thought I was only interesting as a FWB to her, because of our age difference. But apparently (lucky me) not. So I told her I want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.

 One thing she said stood out for me. She is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. And starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. And she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously I feel the same way. So yeah who knows maybe she or I will change our mind but this is the plan for now. Luckily abortion is legal in my country. Thanks for the advice everyone. On one hand I'm ridiculously happy that I'm now officially with her, like I honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.  But yeah the situation kinda sucks. And yes we'll be using condoms..",relationship_advice
[update] my bf (24m) has a random violent outburst in the middle of the night and now I'm (24f) terrified.,"[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9c9ktm/my_bf_24m_had_a_random_violent_outburst_in_the/?st=JPGEOE4R&sh=25249564)

Tl;Dr I'm free

I really want to thank each one of you who commented on my previous post. This wasn't a decision I took lightly and it took a great deal of swallowing my pride. 

I would like to say I dumped him as soon as I read everyone's comment about him being abusive. Unfortunately it took me a bit longer to come to my senses. The following things happened after my post...

I tried to talk to him about being unhappy and saying he needs to leave. He told me to shut up and leave him alone. I told him I'm not leaving until we finish talking. He started to do the dishes and he said if I didn't shut up he was going to start to break a dish for every word I said. I didn't stop talking. He threw a bowl at my feet and I stepped in glass. He started profusely apologizing after he realized my foot was bleeding. He telling me he loves me. I stupidly forgave him.

Later he called my work screaming at me to get the fuck home. I kept asking why? He told me get the fuck home now or I'm going to kill myself. I start crying and freaking out because he has the kids and I hear the baby crying. I start asking is the baby ok? He says shut up and get the fuck home. Hangs up. I panic and leave work right away. I try calling him the whole drive home (20minutes). I'm panicking thinking my children are in danger. I come home and it turns out the baby pooped in his diaper and things got a little messy when trying to change him.. I was like are you serious? I told him I understand he was stressed out but he can never call me like that at work ever again. He called me selfish and a cunt.

When I realized in that moment I feared him hurting my baby.. I knew this had to end. Regardless of how much I thought I loved him. If his mom stopped watching the kids.. I'd figure it out but I couldn't do this my whole life. I was exhausted physically and emotionally. I didn't care if I was alone forever because no one wants a single mom of 2 kids.. I just wanted to live in peace. 

So the day I did it. I couldn't talk to him in person because he would twist my words around and I did not want to be subjected to more violence. I wrote him a letter. I wrote down everything I could think of. I recalled every memory of him that has scarred me over the last 8 years. I told him I already do this alone it's time for me to actually be alone. With the letter was my ring he gave me. I told him don't fight this. You can contact me but only to see the kids. I had packed a bag and went to my parents. I told him I would gather the rest of things in a few weeks.

It's been hard. I wake up in panic thinking what have I done but then I come to my senses and realize how calm I feel. I don't feel like I'm walking on egg shells anymore. I don't even care if he's right and no one else wants me. I'm happy again. Thank you reddit. I don't think I would've finally gotten the courage with you guys. 

Edit: wow I did not expect this response. Thank you so much for the support. I just wanted to clear up some things.
I will not be going over alone. I originally planned on bringing my dad but I did not know about the police escort. I will definitely have to look into that.
I will not let him have his children alone. I will drop them off at his parents house for him to visit with them.
I didn't realize when I posted my original post that these were abusive tendencies. I thought because he wasn't physically abusive it didn't count. Once people started telling me that wasn't the case I realized this had been going on for over 5 years. He punched holes in all our houses. Have thrown several dishes. Screamed at the top of his lungs at me. Once called me at work because he locked himself out of the house while I was at work. I told him he could either go to his moms for 2 hours or wait for me. He started spamming hate texts saying fuck you bitch, cunt, whore, etc. when I ignored his texts he started calling the phones at work saying the same things. 

Lastly people are saying why I had kids with him or why I couldn't see how bad this was. Well because I was with him since I was 15. From 15-20 it was great. He was my first love. First everything. I had nothing else to compare it to when the anger started. I thought every relationship had its issues and these were mine. He told me I was the crazy one when I would say something. I love my kids and never regret bringing them into the world. They gave me a purpose.

Thanks again..",relationship_advice
Update: Pregnant girlfriend moves out.,"I posted in this sub awhile back about my 6 month pregnant girlfriend packing up and leaving. I found out tonight with a DNA test and confession that I'm not the father. It feels like I'm on Maury.

Thanks for all your advice and as it would turn out you guys were right.

The pain will go away but her guilt never will.

My (32m) wife (33f) has been getting too close with a coworker and I have no clue how to proceed.,"My wife of 11 years has had multiple male coworkers recently added to her mostly female workplace. She didn't have any issues at first until the other women started wearing makeup and ""dressing up"" for them...a few months in I take note that she's doing the same....no big deal. Eventually she starts talking about one of them as if he's ""like you.""(me) again no big deal. But I start noticing her being sketchy with her phone (hiding it when she's talking to him while I'm around...etc) she only uses Snapchat to talk to him so when I confronted her about it there was no evidence and she claimed there was no wrong doing...but the fight had already occurred and I broke trust telling her I've been watching how she hides her phone...etc. Since then I've worked though my insecurities and had accepted that things may not be what I thought they were. But as of recently I found myself in a position where I saw her taking a photo of her legs while naked in a tub, I watched longer and noticed she was talking to him about our personal life such as  turnons and turnoffs. I want to confront her but after the first breach of trust/fights I'm scared she'll shut me out again, and say I have no proof because of fucking Snapchat and that'll be the end of us.

TL;DR: wife gets close to a coworker, I confronted her and said I saw that she was hiding her texts, there was a breach of trust/fight. Let it go, things were good, caught her snapping him tub pics/talking about personal stuff.",relationship_advice
I [27M] don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee [27F],"*(posted from a throwaway account; I'd rather not have this on my posting history. I previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again I realise I need to get it off my chest.)*

I'm currently engaged to a girl that I absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for March. The start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. Everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: I feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

Just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. I don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about BDSM! Everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. Yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if I'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when I'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. I *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. Pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

Sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. It just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. There are times where I want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where I want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where I may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

Often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - I dont know how they do that!*"". Well to be blunt, I'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do I have the exact same desires as her friends. Other times she may say that I ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. It makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which I really appreciate... but that's it.

Previous chats have been fruitless, so I've tried to communicate in other ways. That's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. Quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. So I've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. I hope this shows that I don't even care for specific fantasies, I just want to play and have fun, *and I recognise that's a two way street.*

She recently embarrassed me (I think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so I didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items I purchased. She made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. Yet as I sat there feeling awkward I just realised that I think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. I just feel stuck.

We *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. She's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. Yet for me, the few turn-ons that I've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

So I'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; I have someone I love and I want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone I don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. The last thing I'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. Yet I'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically I'm not bad looking, but I begin to focus on weight I could lose etc. It also changes my perception of her - I then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *I simply don't feel fulfilled*. I just feel stuck.",relationship_advice
My (29/F) sister (33/F) got divorced over her refusal to keep working. She's still unemployed and is mad at me for refusing to live with her and support her financially,"(I'm posting this anonymously because I don't want this on my main reddit account).

My sister (33/F) used to be married. I (29/F) am single and have never been married. A year ago my sister's ex-husband (38/M?) filed for divorce and left her. The reason he divorced her was because she had wanted to quit her job and be a stay at home mom to my nephew, who was 3 at the time. They both worked full-time and they had a housekeeper come once a week and a part-time nanny for their son. My sister didn't want to do any household chores when she was staying home and still wanted to keep the housekeeper and nanny. Without her salary the couldn't afford it and she said her husband could work a second 20 hour a week job on top of the full-time job he already had. She also wanted to spend exactly the same. Her husband wasn't on board with this and he didn't want her to just up and quit her job. She quit once day anyways and only told him after the fact. He filed for divorce.

In the divorce my sister wanted alimony even though the law didn't really call for it in that situation. Since she was able to work and walked out on her job by her choice, the court counted this against her. She was not awarded alimony because of that and because she earned the exact same amount as her ex-husband. The court also awarded them 50/50 shared legal and physical custody of my nephew. The courts preferred method was one week on and one week off but they can do whatever they want as long as the time is split equally. My sister has to have him on mother's day and her ex-husband on father's day and holidays and his birthday are alternated by year. Since the time is equally split and their income and earning was always the same (ie her ex-husband wasn't a lot richer than her) neither of them has to pay child support to the other. The court counted my sister's former job and the fact there was nothing stopping her from working as income that she was making.

They didn't own a home or property and they rented. Her ex-husband kept putting money in the bank account and paying the bills so his son would be okay and so his credit wouldn't be affected. The lease is up on the last day of March and it isn't paid beyond that. My sister has no job and can't afford the apartment so she has to move. Her ex-husband is no longer giving her money since the divorce became final.

My sister hasn't looked for a job. She lost her appeal to the courts ruling for alimony and child support. She wants to live with me and for me to financially to support her.

Our parents are in their 60s and recently sold their house, paid off any debt they had and moved into an apartment for active seniors. It is small but nice. Their siblings and both sets of our grandparents live in similar kind of apartment buildings. Our cousins also live in either apartments or condos and are married with more than one baby/child. They don't have any room for her. Our parents have enough left from their house sale and pensions to afford their rent/bills for the rest of their lives but they are not super rich and can't afford to support my sister.

I am single. I am working towards my PhD and will have it in a few months. I was living with 2 other PhD students who just finished theirs. One got engaged and moved in with her boyfriend. The other got a job offer overseas. I found a small bachelor apartment for myself. My sister is mad that I didn't chose a bigger place so she could move in with me. She also wants me to support her financially once I complete my PhD and start working.

How do I get her and my family off my back. I don't want to live with her. She has a college degree and there is no reason she can't work beyond her being lazy. I am not worried about my nephew because her ex-husband is the best and most devoted father ever and will step in if she isn't looking after him. She said she will find a rich husband but her parenting and divorce settlement says neither of them can introduce any new boyfriend or girlfriend to my nephew or have an overnight visitor if my nephew with them without permission from a judge. How do I get my sister and family (parents, aunts, uncles and cousins) to stop asking me to live with her (even temporarily). My sister was never this much of an idiot before she quit her job. She is fully able to work and I don't want to support her. 

TL;DR My sister's husband divorced her because she quit her job and refused to work. Now my sister wants me to financially support her and my family wants me to live with her at least. How do I get them off my back?

My (21) little sister (12) was just given 1-3 weeks to live. What can I do to make her enjoy her last days?,"My sister was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago with T-Cell Leukemia. She struggled through it, with the chemo, radiation and infections, and lately we thought she was about to overcome it. But a few months ago it started spreading again and now the doctors are telling us we need to bring her home. 

There's nothing else we can do and I've never felt pain like this before. I know I need to be strong for her, but I just wanted to know what I can do to make her happy before she passes? Any ideas are appreciated.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and responses, I've been trying to read them all and respond to you all. 

We told her today about her situation: she cried a bit but told us that she was tired and she knew her time was coming. She will be given small doses of morphine to keep the pain away, have a hospice nurse and be able to pass away at home. I plan to make sure she's up for whatever I think we could do,  but unfortunately big trips or doing big things are out of the question. She's very tired and she seems to want to relax. I also want to say that I am for sure going to be recording audio, videos and taking SO MANY selfies with her before she passes. Some she'll know about and some she wont. I also plan on asking her to either draw me a tattoo or pick one for me, putting the recording of her saying she loves me and her name too. I'll let her pick the area, and see what she'd like to do. 

I have taken a leave of absence at my work and will be with her until her time comes. I will also be talking to my family about counseling and counseling for my little sibling as well ( my brother 10). 

I have read so many kind comments and I appreciate all of the support her, I and my family have received. I'm ignoring any negativity and want to be able to be as strong for her as possible.

I (17f) went to my school counselor about all the nasty stuff my stepfather (50m) does. It's caused chaos at home,"
My mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is dating Zach. It was really stressful when he moved into the house with us, he's bossy and gets pissed off easy.

I started keeping a diary to vent, and every day I'd write in it and talk about what was going on in my life. It helped me cool down and relax when I was upset.

A few weeks ago, stuff got really stressful at home and I decided to put together a list of stuff that upset me and go to the school counselor for advice. I wasn't expecting her to get very involved, I just wanted to talk to someone. My best friend has talked to her about coping with her mom's death and she said she was very kind and helpful.

So i went to the counselor and I'd made a list of the things that Zach did that made me angry, because I wanted to be prepared to talk. I tend to clam up if I have to talk about personal things, and I didn't want that to happen.

So I brought this list that I'll copy here:

- Zach yells easily if he doesn't get his way. At me, at other people like the Applebee's waitress, the cashier at the Walmart, etc.

- Zach is big on ""making up"" even when I'm not ready; he will make me hug him even if I'm still mad, because he's over being mad and wants to make things better.. even though it doesn't work that way

- Zach doesn't respect my privacy, he want though my drawers and got mad because I had panties that he thought were ""too sl*tty"". I've got to hide my diary outside the house because I don't trust him to not read it.

- Zach is judgemental of my friends, how much money their families have or don't have. He says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth

- Zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy I was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger

- Zach is an aggressive driver and I won't go in his car

Anyway, I told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. She asked about my diary, and I said I had more detail about all of this in my diary, I'd show her those pages if she wanted.

Showing her the diary was easier than talking for me. So i was happy to.

And after that, things went down hill. It seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. And she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.

When I was at home and Zach was yelling at me about something, I let it slip what I'd done. I told him to shut up because CPS was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.

He got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. I'm not sure what will happen. Plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can I do?

TLDR - I am rely stressed after talking to s school councilor about my step dad. They made a cps report and i think they're assuming things are worse than they are",relationship_advice
[Update 3] My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea.,"So I want to start out by saying think you for all the support. Most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

So I came home the next day after staying the night else where. She didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. I went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. She came in and asked what I was doing and I told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that I would be sleeping in here. She rolled her eyes and said that she thought I had got over and asked why I even bothered to come home if I was going to act like this. I told her because it is my home and I'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. She stormed off and that was that for that day. 

The next day she I came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  She asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. I told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. The look of rage on her face when I said that last part was something I don't think I've ever seen before. I hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. She told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. We didn't talk the rest of that day.

The next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. Someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. They said we need to talk so I invited them in we sat down. They said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends. They apologized to me for keeping it a secret and said that they agree with counseling and they would be happy to pay for it but changing his name is going to far. I told them thank you and that I haven't made that decision with out a lot of consideration. I told them that you really don't know what you would do till you're in this situation. After a little more talking they left and asked me not to tell my wife they stopped by. I agreed. Shortly after they left I called around and found a counciler and made appointment that worked with both our work schedules. 

When my wife came her I told her about the appointment and she just walked off not saying a word. Our appointment is Thursday and I'm still sleeping in the guest room. That's what's been going on so far. Thank you guys and I'll try to update you again when I can.

Edit. I just want say I'm not just going to up and change the name. It's something I'm considering. I want to talk to the counciler first to see what impact it might have if any and how to go about it if there are none",relationship_advice
My sister(8F) walked in on me(20M) and my boyfriend(22M) having sex! UPDATE," [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b9owlv/help\_my\_little\_sister8f\_walked\_in\_on\_me20m\_and\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9owlv/help_my_little_sister8f_walked_in_on_me20m_and_my/) \-Original post 

I made dinner and put  Frozen on  to get her to sit with me on the couch. It was so awkward. She still wouldn't look at me.

I finally got her to open up. I apologized to her for having seen what she saw. I asked her what she thinks she saw...... all she asked was why was BF hurting me?. I explained that BF and I were just wrestling and I was upset that I lost. Then she goes to ask why was I screaming then? (I was wishing lightening would strike me). I told her that I was mad cause I was losing. She bought it.. THANK GOD. Poor thing got freaked out because she thought BF was hurting me. I texted him and asked him to call me and apologize to me for 'hurting' me. He did and I put on speaker phone and he apologized. She felt so much better after that. She was back to her self again after that. We finished the movie and I gave her cough syrup and put her to bed. Disaster avoided!

I did call and tell my parents. They were shocked. I haven't come out to them yet and they were unaware that my 'friend' was  actually my BF that I've been seeing for a year. As for the sex part.... before they could yell, I apologized  and promised them it won't happen again. AND I reminded them of the time I came home from school when I was 16 and caught them in the act on the kitchen island.  That got me out of trouble. I wasn't grounded or noting. They did ask if they could meet him sometime next week (he also wants to apologize to them).

Today was a good day. Saved my sister's childhood, came out to my parents, had sex- got caught and didn't get in trouble , and parents want to meet my BF.

Lesson learned. If I want to be intimate with him again, I'll go to his apartment.

**Note - Please don't make a comment that is hateful and derogatory towards my wife. My post last time was locked because of this and I wasn't able to respond. I'm posting this at work, and I only have a few pockets of time throughout the day where I can respond.**

By the time I was able to respond to my first post, it became locked. I read everyone's replies and thank you to those who responded with good advice. I got a lot of DM's and I wasn't able to respond to everyone, but I did read your messages. However, I did not appreciate the many comments that simply insulted my wife, I know she fucked up and I'm still very angry at her, but I want to believe she can heal and become a better a person. 

Also, some of the DM's I got were extremely weird & hateful towards women in general, like stuff you see on the incel tears sub - y'all need more help than me and my wife. 

There were some common questions I wanted to address to provide additional clarification. 

* How did she avoid jail? 

I only mentioned the civil case since I felt it was the most appropriate to write about because I was originally angry about our financial situation. There was also a criminal case. Our lawyer thought she would originally have to go to jail for 3 months. However, we were able to get her punishment to be community service instead. She has A LOT of community service hours to fill within a year, she will also be getting visits from a PO. Laura and her husband did file restraining orders against her, I honestly can't blame them for that. It helped my wife that she had a clean record and has family that works in law enforcement. I want her to finish those community service hours first before we talk about her working more hours to help pay me back. 

* Why did she do this to Laura?

That is a good question. I asked her this multiple times over the past several months to try to understand what this woman did to my wife. She would tell me that Laura deserved everything horrible thing that my wife did to her, that Laura was a shitty person, a narcissist, a liar, and just overall a scumbag. But she never really gave specific examples. I've been pressing her for more info, and when she told me some specifics it made me feel sick to my stomach, not because of what Laura did but because how far my wife decided to go due to some petty things that happened in their friendship. Their friendship ended about 8-9 (they had been friends since early in high school) years ago and it was over a man they had both briefly dated. My wife dated ""Matt"" for a few months, she broke up with him because she thought that Matt had feelings for Laura. Laura said she didn't want to date Matt because he had dated my wife. My wife decided to ""test"" her friend Laura's loyalty, and told Laura she had her blessing to date Matt. Laura and Matt ended up dating for a few months, my wife stuck around while they were dating and once they broke up my wife told Laura that she had failed a loyalty test. They fought, and ultimately it was Laura who decided to end the friendship. (Note: In case it's not clear, Laura's current husband is NOT Matt.) 

Secondly, I was able to get some information from her about what inspired her to do this since their friendship had ended so long ago. My wife said she happened to see (by chance, not by stalking) Laura at a restaurant about ~1.5-2 years ago, and it looked like Laura had lost a lot of weight and was fit. My wife and I are both fairly overweight, and apparently Laura use to be overweight too. My wife admitted that she felt angry that Laura had lost a lot of weight while she had never been able to. My wife was also insulting Laura and said that she doesn't make a pretty thin person and that her new muscular body was too masculine. She also insulted Laura's husband's looks and physique as well. I saw both Laura and her husband in person on multiple occasions - they both look like normal, attractive people who obviously work out. (I could also tell my wife was irritated when she saw Laura at the courthouse the first time, and you could barely tell that Laura had even had baby.) My wife admitted that she just wanted to do some snooping to try to find that Laura wasn't doing well in life, she found the opposite and was jealous of Laura's success. She first found out both of their job titles (they both work at tech companies with some sort of engineering title) and their estimated salaries by using something called Glassdoor, and if that's accurate, then both Laura and her husband make really good money. She also saw a photo on facebook of Laura and her husband standing in front of what appeared to be their very beautiful and large home. She said she was angry because she knew that Laura wasn't deserving of any of this. She proceeded to insult Laura about how she's not that smart, not pretty, not responsible, she claimed that all Laura did through college was do drugs, drink, have sex with anything that had a penis, skip class and failed a lot, my wife said that she's the type who would cheat on her husband, that she's manipulative and is always up to something, etc. 

Both Laura and her husband seemed very sad and exhausted throughout the whole ordeal. I never picked up on anything sinister from Laura at all, I felt absolutely awful for her. I felt extreme shame and embarrassment whenever I was in the same room with Laura and her husband. I don't think I was ever able to make direct eye contact with either of them.  

So..yeah. I was expecting Laura to have done something truly evil or sinister in the past and that just wasn't the case. 

* Does she feel remorseful?

I want to say yes, she does. She has been really depressed since this all finalized. However, I can't help but think she's sad only because she got caught. She hasn't directly said anything that would lead me to believe she is truly remorseful. 

She's still angry at Laura for escalating to the point of a criminal and civil case, she feels that Laura overreacted. My wife believes every horrible thing she said about Laura. She's convinced that Laura is some kind of alcoholic/drug addict who cheats on her husband, and is the type to lie and cheat her way to the top of her career. And somehow Laura is able to hide this from everyone in her life. My wife felt like she was trying to ""expose"" Laura for the monster that she is. She feels that Laura pressing charges and suing her is additional proof that Laura is vindictive. 

My hope is that she has time to think while she is doing her community service hours over the next year. I think she feels bad that I had to empty out our accounts and sell some things to come up with the money. I talked to her about working more hours once she has finished community service, and she agreed. 

* Are you going to get divorced?

The thought has crossed my mind, but we've been together for so long and I still love her despite this disgusting thing she has done. I can't see my life without her. But, I know (and I'm having a hard time admitting this to myself) that if she doesn't improve or learn a lesson from this mess then I can't be with her anymore. A lot of people mentioned that if she can do this type of thing to an ex-friend, then she can do the same to an ex-husband. This has me worried some, I'd like to believe she wouldn't go nuclear on me if we did file for divorce. I'll be taking precautions in case I have to defend myself in the future. 


* Why is she only working part-time? 

She is a licensed masseuse and works at a really nice salon/spa. Her hourly wage is pretty high, but she hasn't been able to get the hours she wants at the spa she works at. She could probably get a more full time position at a different spa but with a slightly lower hourly wage, which would still bring in more income than what she is doing now. She really likes the place she is at and doesn't want to leave, but I may pressure her to full time work elsewhere to help pay me back and refill our emergency fund once she is done with community service. At the moment she is onboard with helping me put money back into our savings accounts. 

* What about therapy? 

I know we need this, both as a couple and as individuals to deal with this mess. I talked to her about this and she doesn't seem totally sold on the idea of therapy. I've expressed that I think it would help both us, and she seems indifferent at this point. I've talked to her parents, who are really angry/disappointed in her, they basically begged me not to leave her over this. I told her parents that I think therapy would help both of us, but I can't afford it now. They offered to pay for couples therapy, but that is as much as they would be able to afford, so it's a start. I know my wife will need individual therapy, and if that means I stop going to couples therapy so she can get the 1 on 1 help she needs, so be it. 


I'm not ready to call my wife a psychopath as many of the commenters did the last post. I think she got carried away, and thought she was trying to expose someone she truly believed was a bad person. I'm heavily leaning towards that she has had some sort of mental breakdown and focused all of her energy on this one woman and her life. I'm not going to give up on my wife yet. It's very possible that she has some underlying mental illness that could very well be treated with therapy or meds. 

* How much money was she sued for?

I don't want to give specific numbers, but it will take about 4-5 years to get back to where we were prior to this happening. If my wife takes on a full time after she is done with community service and hands over the majority of her paycheck, it may take less than 4 years.  

* Are kids involved?

No, we don't have kids and are not planning on having any. 


* What next? 

That's what I need help with. I've sat down with my wife a few times since the post and I can feel some resistance coming from her about starting couple therapy. I think she's irritated at her parents for offering to pay for therapy for us. She has stated that she would rather us solve our problems together without interference from someone she doesn't know. She's afraid she isn't going to like any therapist we find, and that the therapist will attack her throughout our sessions. I've tried explaining to her that the therapist isn't there to blame anyone, that they would try to help us and that it would be a safe space for her to talk and vent about whatever she needs. I've brought up the idea of therapy every night since the post, and each time she has had an excuse along the lines of - it won't help, the therapist will gang up on her, she isn't going to like the therapist/the therapist won't like her, or that we can solve our own problems at home. 

tl;dr : I answered a bunch of questions I wasn't able to get to before my first post was locked. But, I really need help pushing my wife to get therapy, she is resistant and isn't convinced it will help us.",relationship_advice
"My boyfriend ""slut shames"" me because of my post partum body","Some background: I used to be very small chested and thin. I also used to wear a lot of dresses and he loved this. Last August we had our son, so my body still looked like I was 5 months pregnant until about September when it was sweater weather, so I missed out on my wearing any of the dresses I really liked and he never saw my ""new body"".

Since being pregnant, my chest went from a size B to a DD. My body is just generally fuller and I've been feeling self conscious about it for awhile, but he has been encouraging until now. 

On Mother's Day he bought me a really pretty floral dress. The chest area has a dip that is not over the top, but it does show the tops of my newly bigger boobs. I tried it on and he immediately acted off and told me it would just be an ""around the house"" dress. He has never shamed me before so I figured he thought I didn't like it, so we met up for lunch later and I wore it to show him I did. He blew up telling me how provocative I looked and that I was trying to look ""sexy"" in all the photos with our son and how disgusted he would feel when he looked back at them.
We walked back home and he continued this, every time I walked past a guy he would tell me they must be thinking about how easy I was. He told me that we were going to have to go through my closet and throw away any dresses that make me look like a prostitute. 

I got upset with him and told him I was not dressing to look like a whore and that he needed to accept my body wasn't going to look the same as before, and I couldn't just tuck my boobs away especially in summer heat. He got annoyed and asked if I was actually getting mad over it and we didn't talk for a few hours.

His apology was, ""I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, but, C'MON.""

I don't know what to do as he has NEVER been like this before. I feel so ashamed and humiliated and I'm trying to pretend I am not embarrassed but he has really hurt me but can't see it.

My boyfriend wants to break up after college - i don't but also don't see the point in continuing the relationship until we leave college,"So my bf and I have been in a relationship for 2 years now and I love him like no one else before and I feel like he might be the one. 

In those 2 years we had ups and downs like in any relationship but to sum it up we always worked it out somehow and grew together more and more. 

Fast forward to yesterday: we had been talking about what we wished for our future and at some point he just went ""I think we should break up when we leave college"". 
I was shocked because in every other conversation he seemed like he wanted to continue our relationship. 

The problem is: I really don't want to break up with him. 
I love him so much and I don't see the point in being in a relationship with someone who wants to break up anyway. 


Am I at fault or does anyone else feel like it would be a waste of time?

I (20m) was introduced to this girl (20f) and she is incredibly intimidating.,"I'm not sure what to do. This girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. I really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second I left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot I am which is a good sign. 

The thing is, I used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. She paints full canvases. I listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes I guess. She writes music, sings, and plays the piano. She's an accounting major when I'm in graphic design but only just started so all I can really show her is a super low effort picture I took so I could keep up with the class. 

This girl is incredibly intimidating to me. She knows all these ""show-off-able"" skills and tricks and they're really really cool and the best thing I can do is make fun of the shot-types used in Taken 3 and play video games. I have no idea how I can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

Note: we haven't even hung out 1 on 1 but there's obvious chemistry. Not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

Note 2, Electric Boogaloo: We've only hung out like, twice and it was always cut short. I know I'm overreacting. I just have no idea what to do about this.

Note 3 Return of the OP: okay so I'm going to clarify some stuff to get rid of some negative comments. By impress I mean more of keeping up with her than romantic comedy ""impress"" garbage and by show off I don't mean to show off I mean they're like party tricks or stuff you can physically show off to people or have proof you can do like a painting. I've got none if that.

Also thank you so much for the silver. This has never happened to me before.

I let my friend's husband watch her on video call,"Okay listen...moved from r/AITA

My friend ""Sarah"" is on her 3rd marriage at 29. She's got an alcohol problem and gets herself into stupid situations and has cheated on all her partners since I've known her. Her current husband is a great guy, but kind of naive. He really has no clue - he just loves her so much. A couple weeks ago he stopped by my work, and after some small talk he straight up asked me if I had seen or heard of Sarah seeing other men. I told him I honestly didn't know, because I don't \*know\* 100%. He seemed really beat. It was awful. Fast forward to this past weekend, few of our friends got together, and she started to tell us about some dude she met. I was a little buzzed, so I decided to try to sneak her on video. I clicked on my contacts and sent him a video call and he actually picked up. I pretended to be into my phone and just let it roll. He ended the call abut 2 mins in but it was enough to hear what she was talking about. The next day I felt sick at myself for what I did, but my husband thinks he needed to find out, and deep down I do too. I have no idea what's going on or if Sarah's husband even confronted her. Am I the worst person ever?

&#x200B;

Edit: I also previously knew the husband from middle school band! So I was the probably his first choice in confiding/asking.  ""Sarah"" is the one problem child of our group. She has 5 kids (NONE OF THEM HIS BTW), so she rarely goes out and is more on the periph. Also, she was a guest at my wedding and stole the microphone to sing - and that was like 10 years ago.  I care about her as a human, but Sarah is probably the one toxic person I need out of my life. This'll probably do it.",relationship_advice
Update: Today I (18M) found out my best friend (18F) knows i'm in love with her,"\[Original post\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bbm8hz/today\_i\_18m\_found\_out\_my\_best\_friend\_18f\_knows\_im/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bbm8hz/today_i_18m_found_out_my_best_friend_18f_knows_im/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))

So today at school I decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. And I must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. So naturally I asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". So then I asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". After that I really just lost it and went home to sleep. It really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. My until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. How blinded could i have been? Anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure I just wanna stay away if I can and distance myself now. And yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but I can only hope these emotions will go away slowly. I guess those damn romcoms are a lie after all :)

Cheating? Found a clean sock that is not mine.,"I believe my girlfriend is cheating or has cheated, am I crazy? I've been together with her for about 6 years and live together. I'm not the jealous type, the type of guy who questions friends, or snoops throuh phones. There are no clear cut signs of infidelity except for two recent events that were odd. The first event, we enter her car and I get a hint a cigarette smoke, nothing crazy but odd considering neither of us smoke. I say out loud ""it smells like cigarettes in here"" she then starts acting very weird and changes the subject while still acting off. Brushed it off, never smelled like cigarettes again. The second and more alarming sign was going through my clean clothes and finding a single men's white sock, alarming because I only wear black and our laundry is done at home, not at a laundromat. I question it this time a bit more sternly but without accusations, ""it's not mine, it's not yours, who's is it?"" The response was I don't know possibly when you used to do laundry at the laundromat (meaning I took it without knowing). While this response seems totally feasible I have to remind everyone that we have our own washer and dryer, i haven't used a laundromat in 3 years and when I did it was before I lived where I do now, lastly in the past 2-3 years I'm certain I would have noticed a single white sock in my sock drawer. So I'm asking everyone for help, is she cheating? Other than being up front, what should I do to have more concrete evidence towards my suspicion? Thanks.",relationship_advice
My husband plays favorite to an extreme with our sons,"I am 29 and my husband is 33. We have two sons together, our older son is six years old and our younger son just turned five a couple months ago. 

Our first son is more outgoing and energetic while our younger one is very quiet and sweet. I will call them A and J for this story.

My husband strongly favors A. He's always happy to see him after work. He plays with him, he talks to him. He goes to all his soccer games. He's a good father with him. But to J, he barely looks at him. The most he gets is a short ""goodnight"". He'll scold him for little things like spilling water, and that's the most attention he gives him. He gives him very very little affection. The last time I saw him actually try and bond with him was on J's birthday. A is obsessed with his father, but J doesn't blink an eye if I say something about him. He looks at me like he doesn't know what I am talking about. J is very nonchalant toward his father. I can tell he notices the coldness, I see the look in his face when my husband is drooling over A. When he is home, he just sits quietly playing with his toys.

He doesn't really raise his voice or hit J, he's not cruel just so cold and distant. My husband is a more a cool and calm person, and strict even with A but he does show love when he wants to. It really bothers me, deeply that he would treat his own child like this. I feel like crying. The only thing he is equal with our sons in is gifts. But I really need him to change things. How can I talk to him about this? I have brought it up to him gently before but he only brushes me off. 

My husband doesn't like to be questioned so I am nervous but I need to protect my son's emotions. He is getting older and I am afraid of how much this will hurt him. And has hurt him. I want to know what I can do.

Here's a quick update. You guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, I wouldn't have been able to muster up the courage on my own. So I told him that I didn't enjoy sex. I could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn't fun for me and he was frustrated I brought it up. 

basicallyyyy I asked him to please do something for me for once or I can't do it anymore. I don't like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. But He agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when I was getting wet by kissing me. He was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. I couldn't help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and I said I hated him. Not the most constructive thing to say but I couldn't help it. He said he couldn't do that again and offered opening up the relationship so I could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

I do NOT want to be in a polygamous relationships. I am a strictly monogamous type of girl. I don't want 2 boyfriends. So I told him that wasn't an option and he just shrugged. I asked him if he was gay and he said no. I asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he's trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if I want since he wouldn't answer my questions. And when I told him ok it's over, he started crying and I asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

Basically we broke up. I wanna help him and figure out what's wrong but he doesn't wanna open up so there. I didn't think he'd get emotional but yeah",relationship_advice

Asked me if I thought she could be having an affair (he has a history with weird stuff turning out to be cheater SO). Suggested I get a PI in case of cheating, and call my lawyer in case of murder.

I said I'll consider it. But I know my wife, she is usually pretty shy. I'm still REALLY thinking this might be something silly that got her embarrassed. Was it any other topic, I'd have asked right away. The funeral thing just got me creeped out and I probably would leave it alone if not for my growing curiosity.

Buddy makes a point that there is no harm in calling my lawyer just to check on the procedure to change beneficiaries on life insurance and such, so I'm prepared in the event things go even more weird. I agree, no harm in that. Call the lawyer, tell him I'm discussing finances with the wife and we are thinking about changing both our beneficiaries (trying not to make it look like I suspect her, you know), he says he's stepping into a restaurant with a client can he call me back.

I move on with my work, have a long day, so, honestly, I forget about it.

When I get home late at night, my wife is *upset*. And that is an understatement.

I am quickly educated on two things that happened on her day:

1 - Lawyer called. He wasn't able to get a hold of me anywhere else. Was wondering what were the questions we had about changing the beneficiaries on life insurances. Wife had no idea what he was talking about. He seemed uncomfortable upon hanging up.

2 - Turns out my buddy talked to his wife (in confidence) and told her everything. His wife told a couple of close friends (in confidence) as well. And on it went until the gossip reached a friend of my wife's who actually knew what was happening. She called my wife and told her she should talk to me asap.

She is mortified. Upset, hurt, confused, embarrassed. The whole deal. A little mad as well. Maybe more than a little.

She tells me she joined a community theater, drama club, something, and will be playing a widow. The monologue is an acting exercise to tap into emotions. (Which btw is something many of you told me was a possibility, so thank you, you were right). Her friend (the one who knew what was going on) was the one who convinced her it would be a good idea, to help her out with her shy personality.

She lied about it being a book because she too thinks it is a creepy thing to do, and didn't feel like sharing at the time, since the whole drama club is something she was doing for herself. But she thought I only heard her speaking, as in ""her voice"", not ""what she was saying"". Had she known what I heard, she would have explained it.

I ask her why didn't she tell me about the drama club. She looks at me like I have no business asking her another question for as long as we both shall live, not even about the weather. But she says it is ""her thing"" and she even made her friend promise not to mention it because she didn't want all of us at one of the plays (we are a tight bunch) until she was more comfortable on stage.

I say she could have just told me, to which she replies with something like ""are you telling me that you can keep something private that happens in our household to yourself without bringing all our friends into it?""

After the latest events I don't have an answer for her.

But I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. So I ask ""what about the wedding dress?"".

This is when I realize this part of the story didn't reach her yet. She asks me ""what"" and I have the pleasure of telling my wife I went through her personal computer.

**Now** she is homicidal.

Grabs me by my shirt, drags me up to our closet and shows me ""the wedding dress"" (in the making) for the play. It is amateur theater, so they have more than one job and she is also helping with the costumes, wardrobe, whatever it is called. She was looking online for cheap dresses or for styling ideas to make her own (she is quite skilled in making clothes and such, and the search history did say ""old"" or ""vintage"" wedding dress). She also shows me nun's clothes and a pirate's in her closet and asks me if that means she is attacking the British. By now I am just wondering what the fuck is this play about? A bride, a pirate and a nun? Who the fuck is writing this shit? But I'm guessing I shouldn't be talking anymore.

She is pissed that I would think she is capable of murder enough to call our lawyer, that I told all our friends about her embarrassing monologue and went through her personal computer. Not to mention ruining the drama club she was enjoying.

I just nod, apologize profusely, try to explain that things didn't happen quite like that, and show myself to the guest bedroom because we both know where this is going.

She then tells me I can't even sleep there. Since my brother and his wife will be staying with us for a few days, she already changed the sheets and had everything cleaned and ready and says ""you will just make a mess""

So last night I had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr Wife was practicing my eulogy, turns out it was a play. I got to sleep on the couch and am currently hoping she wont file for divorce.

&#x200B;

Edit just to be safe: I realize I took some liberties with my writing.

Just to make it clear: I think she was more upset with the version of the story that reached her than the actual facts. It will take her a moment to process the stuff (what actually happened) I told her. Also, she didn't use any literal physical violence against me. That was just bad writing on my part.

You all be good, you wonderful people

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

People calling it bullshit made me smile. People saying the fact I didn't answer to those calls proves that it is bullshit made me smile some more.

I mean no disrespect, but I have a job, guys.

Look, I had a weird problem and I want to say ""thank you"" to everyone who took a few moments of their days to help a stranger. I was creeped out and you all truly helped, so thank you!

To the ones asking for more details... I mean, I could say my wife is a Pilates instructor who has most of her day to herself, that our study is a mess of fabric and half made clothes so she could be working on costumes for the whole Cirque du Soleil and I would still be oblivious, I could answer every single question you all have until my fingers went raw, but let's face it: it would be pointless. And I would have to share more personal details than I am comfortable with. I even mentioned on comments I kept some details (and people) out of the story for this very reason.

So thank you to the ones who believed me enough to help, I read all the comments, though I couldn't answer them all. This update was for you, since I received more help than I thought I would, when I first posted. You guys were amazing.

Thank you to the ones who called it bullshit as well, you guys keep this sub in check. It's part of the ride.

And if you are neutral, but my story amused you. Thank you for stopping by and you are welcome.

To the ones suggesting I should post on TIFU, I might later if I get some time.

I haven't read all the comments yet, not even close, but I will do my best to!

[UPDATE]I'm feeling a lot of anger about this child[M5] of my[M39] wife's[F39] affair that I've been talked into being a father figure for.,"[First post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cctm2u/im_feeling_a_lot_of_anger_about_this_childm5_of/)

Hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. I guess I'm kind of in a spot to update now.

So, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. I heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were Max in their own families and you all told me what I should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

I resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after I posted, midway through their custody week. Many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but I wanted to deliver the message before having to take Max again. I was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

The meeting did not go well. They were both pretty mad at me. I had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. I told myself just to be polite and firm, that I didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""I'm sorry, its not working out"". I guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that I was fucking up. In hindsight I do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that I regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment I really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. Then, he said something about how I wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. That made me very mad. Thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. I have some different opinions on ""fairness"". I said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then I stormed out and I didn't talk to the boys.

I didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. They immediately were asking about why Max wasn't with them and I, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than I had up to this point. I talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with Max, but that I'm their father and that Max has his own father to spend time with. I also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that I don't like having to spend only every other week with them. That their mother's decision to start another family with Max's father and Max still makes me sad. This is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. I've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant I haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. If you can't say anything nice, as they say.

Trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. I don't want to blame their mother, but I also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what I mean. This would be one of the situations I identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means I have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""She decided"".

I think I actually did a good job navigating the conversation. My sons absorbed it easier than I expected. A few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

I have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. I sort of feel like I want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that I'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. I think she remains upset with me, more for the things I said than the rejection of this arrangement with Max. Or maybe that's just projection, because that's what I feel guilty for. I also regret that the last time I spoke to Max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. I don't know. I guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but I don't know how sturdy that story will be.

Rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how I talked about Max. I know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so I'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. I'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and I am obligated to interact with her politely so I guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto Max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

So, I sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. Contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.

I (30m) and my wife(31f) decided to take custody of my half sister(10f) after my stepfather died in an accident. I suspect that she was abused.,"This is actually so heartbreaking to write. I really never knew my stepfather that much, because my mother married him after I moved out. My mother died fighting breast cancer and the custody of my half-sister was given to my stepdad. She was only 4 when my mom passed away.

I used too see her once in a while. She was always a quiet child. She didn't speak much to me. I always remember thinking something was wrong with my stepfather. He just didn't seem like a nornal person.

So, he died in an accident and I was asked if I was willing to adopt her. I and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. We were actually so happy. My daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. She was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

But yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. I told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

But she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. I was really taken aback by what I heard. My wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and I was really shocked. 

My stepdad was an asshole and a predator. I don't want to get into explicit details but he used to hit her, and sexually harass her. I actually cried for so long because I couldn't imagine this innocent girl going through that. How do I help her?",relationship_advice
Final update : I divorced my husband because of my MIL and now he wants back in.,"So I thought of giving you the last update as you helped me trough this.

I didn't have enough evidence to request an ex parte, aka emergency child custody. So my lawyer and I had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. We got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

We also had to be very wary of the signs. He in fact quit his job and on a realtors page I saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. That and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

I couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. We tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 I got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. My daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). My ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. Which was stupid because even without the decree I had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could request the passport.

After that things went actually very fast. He was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that MIL had bought 3 tickets with no return date to Mexico. I could request an ex parte. After a shit ton of documents I submitted it. In most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. We had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. Atm I have sole custody for my daughter. This is all temporary. My ex has visitation rights if I was present but he can't take her anywhere. This is once the investigation of him is closed. 

I was cursed out by my ex and ex MIL and they said they will try to Contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

My daughter will continue in therapy. Specially after this. I will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

This was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. I don't think that I will update again but I wanted to thank you all for your Tipps and support. I am really thankful as I am finally not anxious the whole time! Thank you really much!",relationship_advice
"I (28M) is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then I discovered something. Need advice.","We've been together for 7 years, and we've been really really happy together. She's sweet, loving, and caring.. She's already been close to my family, and me to hers. We are really connected to each other, same passion, same likes and dislikes, we frequently travel together and all. We rarely fight, and when we do, we resolve issues quickly.. It's like a perfect relationship. We've been steady, we're genuinely happy in love.

Just when I was already contemplating on proposing to her, I felt like she's gone cold for the past month. Just this valentines, we were on top of the world surprising one another with gifts and sweet nothings. But the following weeks felt different.

Her ""I love yous"" weren't as enthusiastic. The way she talks and communicates with me feels different. She easily gets upset over trivial things. She seems to be a different person all of a sudden. I actually asked her what's wrong, but she assures me everything is ok and something is just bugging her.. I asked again but it seems she doesn't want to open up.. She assures me though that she loves me very much.

Then, just recently, like 4 days back, I was reminded that she has a spare phone just sitting on my drawer, phone was dead and was not used for almost la year. So I grabbed on a charger, booted it up.. and it so happened that her google account is still logged in on the device. Curious, I went to see what she's been up to lately, then I discovered her recent searches /history in google and youtube. I was shocked and I dont know how to react. The searches go like this:

* I cheated on him
* i cheated on him many times
* I cheated should we break up
* Breaking up a long term relationship... and so on

The searches were dated Feb 15 onwards. Almost everyday she looks on the same searches and other related topics.

I am devastated discovering this. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep. But I haven't confronted her about this.

What should I do? Do I need to confront her? We are currently far apart now due to work, but we will be seeing each other next week. I am confused, I am in shock, idk how to react. Please help.",relationship_advice
Caught gf sending lewd photos - BUT how do I go about acting on this...,"Quick back story, I was told by her in Feb that a guy at her work fancied her, she said she wasn't interested. Turns out she met him out of work once (as 'friends'), I hit the roof, she said sorry, blah blah, the usual. He left her work and got another job a few weeks later (unrelated). A few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. I said again, I'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise I'm 'controlling' but I trust her to make the right decision. She still met him. 

&#x200B;

At this point i'm ready to call time on this shit BUT - We have a mortgage. I need to get financial advice regarding this. We're not married.

&#x200B;

Fast forward last night.

&#x200B;

I caught her sitting on our sofa sending lewd selfies (lifting her top etc), however there's a twist. So obviously I've suspected this shit for months, I popped upstairs and left my phone upright on a desk near the sofa recording... And boom, played back the video a little later and saw it. 

&#x200B;

So where do I stand in this. It feels awkward because I secretly filmed this (which I know is fucking weird but i suspected something, needed to know, and well.. It turns out I was correct). 

&#x200B;

What should I do? I can bet without doubt it will be turned on me 'having trust issues' or something and what I did will make me the fucking bad party in this. Make no mistake, I'm fuming, I blame her in this, not the guy. It takes two to tango.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I've (21/M) been dating a girl (20/F) for two months now but I haven't told her that I have a micropenis,"Link to original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bilxyp/ive_21m_been_dating_a_girl_20f_for_two_months_now

After reading tons of replies in the thread and all of the positive stories about girls who dated guys with thumb dicks, I was able to tell her about my peewee issue without feeling very embarrassed. I opted for a playful serious way to talk about it with her, so I told her that I had a micropenis and that I was serious. She asked me how big it was and I said that it was in the 2 inch region, give or take a bit. She said that she didn't expect it to be so small and that she wished I told her sooner, but she said that it's okay as long as I make it up to her in other ways. ;)

We decided that since I'm gonna have to make up for my lack of a fun-rod, we'll just buy toys that I can use on her and give each other the good ol mouth treatment. After she took it well, I jokingly told her that since my penis is around the size of one of her thumbs, we should have a thumb war and that instead of my thumb, I can use my penis in battle. She took it well and we both laughed about the joke and continued on with our day.

Anyways, I can successfully say that we did it Reddit! Thank you all for your stories and advice, it really helped me out a lot. Looks like we're in it for the long run without any issues.",relationship_advice
"My (30M) wife (29F) just told me she doesn't love me anymore and wants to end our relationship, but still live together for financial reasons and for continuity for our 3 young kids. Is this a terrible idea?","I'm going to start by apologizing in advance if this doesnt stay fully focused.

My wife and I have been together for 10 years. Married for 5. We met in college and has been the love of my life since.

2 days ago she told me she doesnt love me anymore and for her happiness wants our relationship to end.

I probably should have seen this coming, our relationship has been rocky since we met but for whatever reason I always wanted to make it work. 

We have 3 kids together, all under the age of 6. They are amazing and so happy and the best thing from our marriage.

Financially, my wife is a stay at home mom. She owns our house outright from family money. She has no student loans but also no college degree. I make a fairly decent income and support our family. 

Since my wife doesnt have a job and no way to pay bills, she wants me to move into her finished basement and continue to pay utilities and food for us and our kids, in addition to keeping her on my health insurance. She wants to take time to get her degree and file for dissolution afterwards, so she can support herself and our kids.

She also wants this for continuity for our kids. While she doesnt love me anymore, she doesnt want me out of our kids lives even weekly, and still wants to be friends with me.

I'm honestly dying inside right now, because as rocky as our relationship has been I've never loved her less, and she has been all I've ever loved or wanted.

I dont know how to proceed or even feel at this point. Im terrified because I've let my friendships go since we've been married and while my family will support me i dont have many friends left. I'm terrified about finances. I'm terrified of not being able to be happy without her. Honestly i'm so confused about everything going on in my head.

On top of that, is it stupid to stay in the house for our kids? It would be convenient for me financially too as even though if I moved out we would share custody, I dont have to pay child support this way. It's also better for my taxes. 

I'm just so lost I dont know what to think. Sorry for the long winded ramble.",relationship_advice
My (17F) boyfriend (22M) said he will end our relationship if I don't go to the same uni as him,"Hi reddit. 
University offers here came out today and I got my second preference which is a different university to the one my bf is currently in. 
We are interested in studying the same course so we would be in some of the same classes if I go to the same university.

"My Fiancée isn't speaking to me after I used ""our"" money to help my dog. Not sure not to fix this?","My dog (German Shepard) began acting strangely a few months ago. First couple vet visits didn't show anything until eventually we felt a large lump under his fur which was later identified as a tumor. It was confirmed to be malignant and required surgery to remove completely. 

The vet I spoke to said it would likely cost over $5000 to remove it completely and there's no guarantee it will be a success. I don't know why the cost was so high, but it didn't matter to me. My dog is my dog and there is no question in my mind that paying for the surgery was the right thing to do. 

I paid for the surgery out of my own savings. This is important. My fiancée and I have separate finances and my savings are easily 5x what she had saved up. When she found out how much the surgery cost, she went ballistic that I paid for the surgery without asking her when we're planning a wedding. She says that she will have to downsize her wedding to compensate, and that my dog is already so old (10) the money ""wouldn't go far."" I can't even comprehend how she could say that to me.

I honestly can't empathise with her here, which has caused a massive rift in a previously amazing relationship. My dog is my dog and he's a member of the family. I refuse to put a few thousand dollars over his well-being. My fiancee is acting as though I'm being selfish and that our wedding should come first, since we're starting a family.

She hasn't talked to me since other than to tell me to take out the garbage, clean the dishes, etc. If I try to engage conversation she will shut down or walk away. She refuses to talk this over unless I get on my knees, grovel and apologise. I can't bring myself to do this as a matter of principle and self respect.

So my question for people here is how am I supposed to get her to talk to me and patch things up? I don't want to throwaway the relationship, but at the same time I feel this is something I cannot compromise on...",relationship_advice
I(30F) am scarred by hearing so much about my fiance's (30F) past sex life because we have issues with sex,"Is it normal to have heard extensive details about your partners past lovers? I know about the random guy who ran into her on her bike whom she ended up fucking, the guy from work who was twice her age whom she wanted to have sex with SO BAD but he wouldn't fuck her as much as she wanted, her old boyfriend who could get her off 5 times in a row (I've gotten 2 out of her just once), the boys dorm where she made her way up and down the hallways, the married guy who she had a one night stand with, etc. etc. There are so many I can't even remember them all. Now, I'm constantly comparing myself to them and wonder why her libido isn't that high with me.

I am one of a handful of women my partner has been with. We just got engaged about a month ago (yay!) and have been together for a year and a few months, but this is an issue that concerns me for our future. For the majority of the time we have been together, sex has been an issue. She has a hard time with me initiating and usually turns me down. She has conveyed this is because sex for her isn't about love, it makes her feel trapped and like I want something from her. I've gotten to the point where I get severe anxiety about initiating and we have gone from having a lot of sex (like 5-6 times a week) to having sex sometimes just once a week. Even when we do, I usually feel anxious about it because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. There are also feelings of resentment for me around it now because it's always on her terms, I feel like when we do do it, she probably doesn't really want to, and also PARTLY because (and this may be horrible of me) I struggle with worrying that she might just be with me (a woman) because she has felt used by men. Even just with kissing she struggles. At one point we were kissing and she jerked back and practically screamed at me how much she hates kissing me. Almost immediately afterward she started saying she didn't mean it and trying to take it back, and I haven't heard it since, but still now when I kiss her I just feel like she's waiting for it to be over. It breaks my heart and I don't know how to fix all of this and remove the pressure that we now both feel around sex and physical intimacy.

&#x200B;

Edit: thank you for all of the perspective. Some common questions have been about her mental health and whether she is dependent on me for anything. She does have a Bipolar-II diagnosis, but is not treated for it. She also experiences depression and is treated for that. Secondly, she is not dependent on me for anything monetarily or otherwise.",relationship_advice
Accidentally played porn at my girlfriends sisters wedding...,"Hi Reddit, 

I always read items on this sub bust never thought I'd be posting on it, especially about this...

So here's the context, my girlfriends sisters wedding was on the weekend. They were having a fairly low key wedding and I offered to help where I could, setting up the reception area etc which was all fine. I work at a gym so we have a portable PA system with microphone for the group fitness classes. They were going to hire a PA system but I told them to save the money and I'll let them borrow the one from my gym, I set it up so the grooms phone would connect via Bluetooth as all he wanted to do was play a Spotify playlist throughout the night and use the PA for the speeches. 

On the day everything was going fine, everyone was seated and went quiet for the groom to talk so someone turned the PA system on. This is where it all went horribly wrong... my phone automatically connected to the speaker and started playing what was on my phone last... this happened to be porn from the night before, porn sounds started playing from speaker in front of everyone including the brides and grooms families... I grabbed my phone out of my pocket to stop the sounds, the groom laughed slightly and continued... my girlfriend saw me get out my phone and press pause on it so she clearly knew that porn was coming from my phone. She didn't say anything at the time however I went home and now she isn't responding to any of my messages and I don't know what to do? Do I leave it for a few days or keep trying to get in touch with her. Any advice would help I don't know what to do... ",relationship_advice
I (25/m) just found out my pregnant GF (22/f) cheated on me. The guy got into a serious car accident.,"I am in shock right now. My relationship started to become strained after the birth of our first child. I found out during dinner with her fucking parents. Her phone started going off like crazy. It was from her friends and they fucking knew. She left her phone at the table to grab her coat after all the fucking waterworks. The bitch was fucking some dude called Andrew and it started recently. Recent enough for me to doubt that the child she carries is even mine. I broke her phone when she tried to grab it from me. Her parents threatened to call the police on me. I left with my son. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to be involved with my child(ren????) life. I am so fucking angry right now. 

Edit: I want a relationship with my children and not her. I can't be a father long distance. Her boyfriend is brain dead. Her mother told me to ""HAVE SOME SYMPATHY"". FUCK THAT. My life is ruined.

Edit 2: Most users are assuming I am a US citizen. I am not. Once my contract is up, I will have to leave the united states. How an earth can I be a father if I can't even be with my children.

Edit 3: I picked up the damn phone out of curiosity. Holy shit. I was assaulted when tried to take it from me.  

Edit 4: Phone is still with me. I;m taking screenshots. I paid for it by credit card. My name on the contract.

Edit 6: Waiting for her to return before I do anything. Need to video myself leaving my apartment untouched and in peace for my own safety.  ",relationship_advice
HELP!!! MY FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND CALLED HER BY MY NAME DURING SEX!!!!,"Hi, my (20F) friend (21F) is no longer my friend as of like a few hours ago because her boyfriend (21M) called her my name during sex. I've been so cooperative and supportive through all of her relationship. I used to date her boyfriend years ago and he treated me like royalty and would take me out everywhere and she was my friend through it all. About a year ago I guess they hit it off and I decided to distance from him (we were still friends) out of respect for her. 
She constantly vents to me about ME and about how he doesn't treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn't understand it. I feel terrible but there is nothing I can do, I don't understand it either. I've always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but I guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. She blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. Reminder; I haven't spoken to him outside of when I'm with both of them together in a year!!! 
He has called her by my name before but it's always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
She insists we cannot be friends and I tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.
Advice??


UPDATE: after going through ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS (yes I read all of them) I feel there is some stuff to clear up. She asked me for permission to date him and I gave her the go ahead which is why him and I distanced. It was a mutual agreement, he also said that it would be best if we distanced for her sake. Our interactions are minimal at get togethers or whenever I go to see her because THEY LIVE TOGETHER. he has never been flirty or creepy towards me so I do believe it's an honest mistake. As for the comments that state that I ""am clearly not over him"" that relationship died years ago and I am with somebody happily. I want to take your advice and just ""drop them"" but this is years of friendship I want to save...

UPDATE #2: First of all thank you guys so much for the replies and help, you guys have, if anything, reassured me I did nothing wrong. I was not too sure before. I am also aware that this may not be a friendship worth saving as she has always been this way, always had to be right and I have always put in more effort. However, I do not mean to make this about something else but after high school I have been left with 2 friends, one of which was her. It's hard to think about my life being more empty than it already is and I feel like every single year I have less and less people in my life even though I am TRYING SO HARD to keep them around. I have been there for her and friends with her for 10 years and never through her fuckups even thought about ending the friendship. I'm just left wondering, once again, what it is about me that made everyone disappear after high school. Again, sorry if I'm turning this into something else. It's not my intention but the need to save the friendship is deeper than just ""oh I just want to be friends""",relationship_advice
My (26F) husband (31M) cheated at his bachelor party,"I don't know what to do. We got married in December and things were perfect. We've been together since I was 23. 

His friend is getting married and I noticed one of his other friends give my husband a funny look when talking about the new bachelor party. Like raising his eyebrows and laughing. My husband did not react and ignored him but I knew something was up. 

We allow each other on our phones so he was sleeping one night, I was awake, I saw it and got tempted. Went through messages and pictures. I saw a few things in his photos in the ""hidden"" album, he didn't really hide it too well but we don't go on each other's phones so he probably thought he was fine. I saw a video and a couple of pictures of a girl blowing my husband. It was fucking disgusting. He actually bought me a necklace when he came back, just realized he probably felt guilty or something. 

I read through his messages and saw his friends mentioning the party while planning the new one. He apparently snorted coke off some girls boobs too. My husband was telling them to forget about it and it was a long time ago and he was just having fun for one night and it would never happen again and he's committed to our marriage. He is so full of shit 

And I got pregnant on our honeymoon. I don't know what to do. How do I bring it up. What do I say. I feel so sick and dizzy ever since I found out. And I was at home, having a quiet tea party with my friends, opening up presents and talking about house decor. I feel so fucked over!! I can't believe he would do this to me",relationship_advice
I (26m) am interested in a woman (27f) who happens to be transgender. She doesn't know that I know. How do I tell her in a way that doesn't cause hurt feelings or concerns for her safety?,"**WE ARE OFFICIALLY TOGETHER NOW**


I'm making a throwaway because there's a reasonable chance that she's on Reddit.
This situation has a few different factors which I'll try and summarize quickly.

We're both on the west coast. 

I'm a pretty stereotypical cis dude, though I'm not saying that anything I do is meant for cis dudes alone, because that's ridiculous. I just fit a stereotype. I work as a carpenter. I like nascar. I lift weights. I don't get astrology (more power to y'all, I just don't really see it clicking for me). I like MMA. I have done a keg stand (poorly). My favourite movie is ""Predator"". I love craft beer and I have, in the past, even caught myself wearing a beer t-shirt to social events. I have a beard and a digital watch.

I also have a ""type"", and that type is REALLY tall women. My family is Dutch, I'm 6'8"" and I like women to be over 6ft or so. It's not a hard preference, but it's a preference I have, which is how I met ""Alice"" (not her real name). 

Alice is fucking awesome. She also happens to be 6'4"". She's part of our mutual friends group, which includes some people who aren't straight and some people who are. A couple of times a month, we meet up at a friend's place and hang out. So not only is she my type, she's somebody that I see fairly often. 

A mutual friend of ours (I'll call him ""Dan"") basically set us up on a date, and we've had a few. We've kissed, but that's about it, and I'm fine with that- no reason to not take things slow. We really do seem to have some chemistry. If I'm wrong about the chemistry, that's fine. I am personally head-over-heels for this gal. We had been texting daily.

During our group meetup a couple of days ago, Alice asked me if I was straight or not. Without really thinking I was like ""yeah, I'm pretty stereotypically straight"". I mean, I was wearing a beer t-shirt at that point. Alice seemed a bit sad about it, maybe uncomfortable, but I didn't really pick up on it or why as I had already had a few beers. The night proceeded as normal, but she left early and we didn't kiss or anything (which is fine, it wasn't a date, I ain't pushy). 

Since then, the texts- which were frequent before- have slowed down considerably, and Alice has been non-committal to dates. She says somethings up, but she's not feeling like explaining it right away. It was a dramatic mood change. I asked Dan what was up, and we talked a bit. He said, ""Y'all know she's trans, right?"" 

She's what?

To make it clear, Dan is under the impression that the entire friends group knows except for me. Admittedly, I'm the newest member of the group. It's apparently not a secret, but I really didn't notice- I wasn't looking either, but there's clues, and I realize now that Alice was probably dropping hints. She legally changed her name when she was 19, I know that much. She's not on speaking terms with one side of her religious family. She's dealt with violence in the past with relationships, which is why she's taking dating slow.

That last bit is what's sticking with me. I am not positive, but I know that trans women have to deal with a metric fuckton of ridiculous bullshit and I can only guess that it might have occurred because she is trans. Even worse, it may have occurred due to somebody like me- some straight dude who might have found out that she was trans and reacted poorly. The question as to whether or not I was straight probably was meant to figure out if I was a candidate or not.

And I mean... Yeah, I'm straight. I go for women. Alice is a woman. I don't really care about the details. I don't care about what is, or what was, between her legs. I think she's fucking awesome and I have absolutely caught feelings for her. Had I known that she was trans when she asked, I'd have said something like ""yeah I go for people who identify as women"" instead of ""yeah I'm straight"". 

I want to tell her that I know and I don't care, but I don't want to invalidate her or reduce her to what she once presented as. I also really don't want to scare her off or make her fear for her life, because I know she's had to in the past and that's horrible. I don't want to accidentally say something that will fuck my chances either, because she's great and I would really love to give this a chance.

I'm thinking of just sending her a message that tells her I heard and I don't care, but that feels too impersonal. Dan has offered to tell her, but I'm not sure WHAT to tell her or how to word it. It feels like I'm invading her privacy to know. I don't wanna bring up old memories of being attacked. I'm worried that I fucked up my chance somehow. 

Tl;dr: clueless straight dude has interest in a trans woman, and is worried sick about the right way to tell her that he knows and doesn't give a fuck. Please help!

UPDATE: we talked. She asked Dan to bring it up to me. All is well! 

Update 2: this has blown up. I can't respond to everybody, but I'll get to a few. Thanks for the good wishes and I'm glad it's brought smiles!

Final update before I go to bed: if this gets outta hand please lock it, mods 

IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING: yeah we're official now.

Was my dad really grooming me or am I overreacting?,"Hey reddit. I need your help! My (21F) father (61M) has had a very strange relationship with me my whole life. I don't live with my family anymore due to university so this isn't affecting me currently, but I am having a hard time processing it. I had another dream about it last night and I cannot bare to keep questioning these horrible thoughts anymore. Am I being stupid or is this serious?

There are little pieces of evidence that have amounted to me wondering if I had been treated wrongly by my dad. Weirdly, a lot of things don't add up and I don't want to accuse my father of anything in case I'm being over dramatic. But there have been occasions where I have known that my dad did things to me that weren't necessarily normal but I didn't say anything. 

My dad doesn't really like my brother. At all. In fact he barely talks to him unless he's getting in trouble. He loved me though. He absolutely adored me. And I adored him too. I never felt uneasy or unsafe around him. Even though he did some weird things to me. There was always something a little bit off. Even when I was little, I just had this weird gut feeling about his relationship with me. He isn't my biological dad, my real dad ran away to New Zealand when he found out my mum was pregnant with me. That's a whole other story, I have actually spoken to him since. He has three of his own kids now. 

My mum and ""dad"" met when my mum was trying to sell her house. I was only a baby at the time. One of the weird things about my relationship with my dad is that I have told lies to make him seem like he is my biological father. I don't know why I do that. It's not that I'm ashamed about him not being my real father. But I feel that maybe if I lied enough I would convince myself that he IS my real dad, and real dads don't touch their real daughters in that way. 

I distinctly having a conversation with my mum about how mum and dad met. This was the first time my tummy ever churned in regards to my dad. She said at the time they met, she hadn't washed in a few days, was struggling with post natal depression and was a single mother. She says she didn't look good whatsoever. To the point where she was so shocked that my dad had asked her out on a date, she worried that it was because of me. My dad was a really good looking man. He was very successful with the ladies. I don't know whether my mum was so insecure that she couldn't believe he would ask her out, or if she has secretly had her own gut feelings. ""What do you mean, to do with me?"" I asked. I was about 13 or 14 at the time. ""Well, I was worried that your dad might have been with me to get to you. Paedophiles come in all shapes and sizes."" I think I'll remember her saying the word paedophile until the day I die. I felt so physically sick at her saying that but it is something I think about on a daily basis. 

That's when a lot of things came flooding through into my memories. I never used to wipe after going for a pee. When I was about 8 years old I was in the bath and mum was watching me. We were discussing about toilet habits and I told her I didn't wipe. ""Why not?"" She said. ""It really hurts when I do"" my mum looked alarmed. ""What do you mean?"" I shrugged it off ""I don't know, it just hurts when I touch down there."" I think my mum was concerned but I don't think she ever found out a reason for it. But I do still remember it being tender when I tried to wipe. I can't remember when it all started. When mum was away on nightshift, he would make me sleep in the bed with him. I honestly can't say if anything happened. He would spoon me. But I don't know if anything else occurred. When my mum was on nightshift, she would get home after my dad went to work, and while she was sleeping, I would take my brother and I out. We would ""run away from home"". I was always such a well behaved girl. But my behaviour got so bad during that time that my mum broke down and told me she would put me in care because she couldn't deal with me. I remember being the problem child very vividly. It's one of the only parts of my childhood I remember. My mum had severe depression at that time too. She was actually put into counselling because I think she tried to take her life. Nobody has spoken about it but I do remember her having to get taken to this place. Which I later learned was a psychiatric hospital. I don't remember any of the time she was away but obviously it was my dad looking after us. 

Fast forward a few years and I have began puberty. I was struggling with my body image like most girls were and I was very confused about everything. I was late getting my period, I was a late bloomer and was teased pretty badly at school by both girls and boys. I have vivid memories of my dad telling me that I have a lovely figure. He squeezed my boobs and my waist and my bum on multiple occasions. ""You're soft in all the places men love women to be soft in."" I was in my school uniform the majority of the time he did it. I looked him dead in the eyes as if to say ""what the fuck are you doing?"" But he always laughed. It really embarrassed me. And most of all I was uncomfortable when he did it. He was supposed to be the one keeping me safe and yet he was the one that made me feel the most humiliated. However, I never felt daunted if I had to spend time alone with him. I didn't feel unsafe APART from when he did touch me. But I have read that one symptom of trauma is not remembering much of your childhood, and I really struggle to remember many memories of both childhood and high school. This could be a coincidence however. 

There were multiple instances where he would slap me on the bum, make me sit on his knee (as a 14/15 year old) and touch my thighs or my bum or my boobs. He would love giving me massages, and would take off my bra. I specifically remember one time I asked my mum if she could rub my back because it was really sore. I took off my bra and hit the ground as quickly as I could to avoid either of my parents seeing my boobs. My dad remarked ""Christ, you have a big set of tits now"". In front of me and my mum. It embarrassed me so much. In a moment of anger I snapped at him ""why the fuck were you even looking?"" Why would your dad WANT to see your boobs?? My mum repeated what I said to him too, which surprised me. I assume she was taken aback by it. Nothing more was ever said. 

Throughout mostly my teenage hood my dad was very hands on with me. I noticed this when I realised that my friends dads weren't nearly as touchy with their daughters. I thought my dad was just showing me affection. As teenagers do, I became aware of masturbating and it became a massive hobby for me. On multiple occasions, my dad walked in on me. And didn't make any attempts to leave. There was a few times I near enough shat myself because I noticed him peering through the crack in the door. Out of panic, I pulled up my pants and ran over to the door and opened it. It was him stood there. ""Yes?"" Was all I managed to blubber out. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. I hadn't heard him coming up the creeky stairs on any of the occasions. 

For some strange reason, and I really don't know if this is paranoia or not, but I always felt overwhelmingly scared that come my 16th birthday he would try and take things further than just inappropriate touching. I have no idea why. Again I don't know if I'm overreacting. I had a boyfriend at this point and dad then became very distant with me. I did however think it was strange that if I knocked on the bathroom door to tell him to let me know when he's out the bath so I can brush my teeth, he would tell me to come in anyway. And he would be there, naked, in the bath. Not trying to hide anything. I don't know if that's normal or not in a household? Throughout this time he did keep touching me inappropriately but again I didn't feel scared in his presence APART from when he did touch me on the odd occasion. 

I think the biggest situation that sticks out in my mind was when I had broken up with my boyfriend and was about to begin university. I asked my dad if he could crack my back as he was the heaviest in my family and always managed to. Mum and my brother we're both in bed. He then asked, ""do you want me to give you a massage"" I shrugged and said alright. I took off my top and he did my back for a while. Nothing weird happened. But then he took off my pyjama bottoms and my pants without even asking. He started rubbing my bum cheeks and my thighs as I laid there in shocked silence. He then proceeded to rub my vagina from behind and my bum hole. At one point he spread apart my bum cheeks to, I suppose ""inspect"" my ""area"". I was absolutely mortified. He did this for about 10 minutes or so. That was the only hard evidence I have for him properly inappropriately touching me. I thought this was going to be the time he raped me. I thought all those years of being scared about turning 16 were finally rational, as horrible as it sounds. I was now 17 but had been with my boyfriend since before I was 16. So my dad hadnt been as full on with the touching. I laid completely still. I didn't tell him to stop. I was so embarrassed. But at the same time I didn't want to embarrass him by telling him it was wrong. So I just let him and hoped nothing would progress. It was the most uncomfortable and ashamed I had ever felt in my life at that point. The only time he spoke to me was to say ""you're very hairy aren't you"" which added to the awkward and embarrassing situation. I never ever told anyone about it. 

I didn't tell a soul about my fathers actions towards me the whole time it happened. I continue and have since the age of about 12 had dreams about my father having sex with me. In all of the dreams, I enjoy it and want it. This confuses me even greater. I feel extremely lost and embarrassed and so utterly ashamed of myself. I'm scared that I'm overreacting with this. I don't want to accuse him of anything. I love my dad but it's no doubt that he is mentally ill. I am not angry at him, I actually feel very sorry for him. This is more for my peace of mind. I just don't want to be confused anymore. And I keep dreaming about it and it's terrifying me that it is a reality.  If anyone would be able to make sense of all this I would be eternally grateful. Thank you so much for listening, it's taken great courage. 

Edit: I cannot thank everyone enough for their kind words. It was extremely hard to write but whilst writing I was actually able to process a lot of it. I am in the process of replying to everyone who has sent me messages, I didn't expect this to blow up at all. When I began receiving the first couple of replies I did have a big cry. I was hoping to myself I was being extremely stupid and I had been overthinking about it all. First thing on Monday, I am ringing a counsellor. That is for certain. I am extremely wary about telling my mum but I'm going to see how I get on with therapy. I know it's the right thing to do, but part of me is thinking that ignorance is bliss. I dont want to tear my family apart. These feelings may change if/when I begin to open up. I'm extremely lucky that I have a loving and understanding boyfriend who unfortunately has also suffered from child abuse. He has had therapy for his and is urging me to do the same (for my diagnosed depression- it's probably linked to all of this tbh). He's the first person I'm going to tell in person. I actually wanted to tell him but I thought a reddit opinion would either tell me to cop on or realise that it was as serious as my gut feeling told me. Unfortunately it was the latter. If this has taught me anything, it's that yeah there are horrible cruel people, but you strangers have shown me kindness. I can't thank you all enough <3",relationship_advice
My(28m) girlfriend(29f) said another mans name during an intimate moment,"We've been together 7 years with a couple of short breaks during that time. Over the past few months I've been getting a nagging feeling that something is not quite right with the relationship, as I've been trying to plan short trips or holidays all of which have been declined with the same response that she cannot afford any time off work. She is also very quick to close any messages on her phone if I enter the room.

This evening during an intimate moment she said the name of one of her male co-workers I confronted her on this and she flatly denied saying anything at all, but I have no doubts over what I heard. 

I took her home in what felt like the longest drive of my life. As I dropped her off I said I wanted to talk about what happened she just left without saying a word.

This all happened just a few hours ago and I'm struggling to comprehend exactly what's gone on.

EDIT: had a rather restless night and what I imagine will feel like a pretty long day at work is ahead of me. There seems to be a consensus on that enough of my time and energy has been wasted on this relationship and it's time to cut my losses.

EDIT2: Back from work and mentally preparing myself for whats about to come. Thank you all to everyone who has shared their comments.

UPDATE: She has completely ghosted me and all I am left with is unanswered questions. All I could do is leave her a message saying it was over and then sit in my flat entirely alone with no response. 7 years ago we had a great relationship then a good relationship then an ok relationship until we had a shitty relationship but it happened so gradually it is difficult to see what exactly went wrong until it felt like it was easier to put up with it than letting go. I don't know what happened and I'm not sure I ever will truly know. I spent a quarter of my life in this relationship and now all I can do is wonder what else I could have done with that time.",relationship_advice
An Update from JasonInHell,"**tl;dr** - I am doing better and I continue to get better everyday

The first thing you may notice is this is being posted from a different account, I deleted the /u/jasoninhell account in a knee jerk reaction to seeing my reddit posts in the news.

I guess the first question to answer is how am I doing, and to that I would say I am doing well. I have bad days but I would think that is to be expected. It is just important that I, or anyone going through something, continue to use the support of friends and family as well as good coping skills to not let myself be completely defeated on those bad days. I won't lie, I struggled to get back to where I am. For some time I refused to sleep because of combination of fear of what I would wake up to and nightmares about that night. For a time I used alcohol to sleep but my family loved me enough to take it from me before it became a damaging and permanent habit. I was hospitalized because I did have thoughts of ending my life because I missed my children so much. From that I learned that you should never be ashamed of your mental health and not seeking treatment will only make it worse, not better. We have all heard it but if you or a loved one is struggling seek immediate assistance, your life is too important to throw away in a moment of weakness. By putting off treatment I only caused everything else in my life to suffer. I lost my job and became reclusive to the house. But don't worry I have been back to work since December and I have nearly regained my former position and salary, so I am good and require no assistance.

The second question would be how do I feel about the sentencing. That is something that is harder to answer, because no matter what the sentence nothing will bring back my beloved children. Do I think she should have gotten the death penalty (which Indiana has), no I do not. She wanted to die and after 9 years of giving her what she wanted when she wanted it I was not going to give her another thing. Do I think the life sentence will have any appreciable effect on her? I don't know, one thing she always stressed for the entire time that I knew her was that she lived her life without any regrets. Even after I caught her cheating on me she continued to say she had no regrets.

As for the ex-in-laws, they continue to be a problem to this day. Shortly after everything happened they changed the locks on the home I was renting from them with my property still inside. After trying to civilly negotiate the return of the property it was required that I involve law enforcement. That is an ongoing legal battle. A member of the family accused me of stealing property I had purchased from them prior to the death of the children and threatened to take action against me unless I paid double what I had already paid them. I alerted the authorities and as far as I know that is resolved. They continue to make visiting my children's grave difficult, during the one year anniversary they sat in their truck and just watched me the whole time I was visiting the grave. Because of that I don't visit the grave as often as I would like to.

If I can impart on you something I have learned through all of this it is that you should always take the time to be with the ones you love. It doesn't matter if they are asking you to read The Poky Little Puppy for the millionth time or asking you to play Smash Bros even though you both know they will wipe the floor with you every time, just do it because you never know what time will be the last time. Always make sure they know how much you love them, I had the fortune that the last thing my children ever heard me say was, ""I love you, good night. I will see you in the morning""",relationship_advice
I found my husbands secret Reddit account where he has PMed girls from gone wild... I feel like this is cheating? Me F29/ him M31 - located in North America,"This is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile. I'm sorry if I make any mistakes. 

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1, friends for 14 (we met in high school.). We were out at an event on Friday night and my phone died while he was busy for two hours so I started browsing Reddit using his phone. My thumb print is programmed into his phone and it isn't unusual for us to use each others phones. 

When I opened his app the entire front page was filled with nsfw content/subs so I looked at the profiles and saw that he was logged into a secondary account used only for porn. I have no problem with porn - in fact we frequently watch it together. I saw his user name and scrolled through a page of comments when he came over to check on me. I quickly closed the app and when I saw him - I'm not sure why.. I think I felt so shocked I didn't want to tell him I'd seen? 

He took his phone from me and while he had it he logged out of that account and gave me back his phone. 

Later that night from my own Reddit account I searched his user name and found hundreds of messages on gonewild subs but also subs for specific girls. His comments were mostly compliments to body types that don't really match with mine. A few girls had posted fantasies about making videos with men while they do xyz or exchanging Snapchat videos. He posted ""I've PMed you"". One of those posts was just before our wedding. 

Four years ago he posted on an askreddit thread titled ""Reddit have you ever met a psychopath?""  He commented ""I may be dating one now. Wait a couple months and I'll let you know"" we had been together two years at that point. But I don't know context - if we'd had a fight or what?

He had an important work event tonight that he was really stressed about so I haven't brought it up yet. I feel sick to my stomach and I haven't slept at all. We've been trying to have a baby and I just can't imagine continuing to sleep with him when I'm feeling so undesirable. 

Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? How do I talk to him about this? I've never felt worse about myself or my body. 

TL;DR - without intending to snoop I stumbled upon my husbands porn Reddit account and he's been messaging people in a way that feels like cheating to me. ",relationship_advice
I [26F] saw my husband [27M] in a gay porn and I don't know how to confront him about it,"Last night, I was watching porn while my husband was asleep. I've always liked gay porn, I watch gay porn exclusively. I go to pornhub and start browsing. I'll try to not make this as graphic as it could be, but I clicked on a random video and it was definitely my husband. His face was fully visible, several unique tattoos. It was him. I knew  without a shadow of a doubt this took place after we were married because he had the goddamn ring on!

I was furious and disgusted. He had unprotected sex with multiple men. All I could think of was STDs. I didn't sleep last night. I called off from work, too. First thing I went to a free clinic to get checked. I haven't been home since. I don't think I can fucking look at him. I'm so fucking angry. 

What do I do?

TLDR Saw husband with multiple men in gay porn that definitely took place after we were in a committed relationship. Would it be gauche to ghost my husband at this point?

UPDATE: I spoke to him. He said he has a meth problem and that it ""turns him gay"". This has been going on for months. He meets randoms off Grinder. This was not an isolated event. I'm devestated. He said he'd go to rehab. I told him we're wayyy past all of that and that I wanted a divorce. He said he'd do whatever as long as I didn't tell anyone because fuck our marriage, fuck the life we have, who cares about that! It's all about his image. I'm just collateral! Yo, I don't give a fuck, I'll send screengrabs to his boss, to his mom, to every one. Fuck you, Brandon.

It hurt to come to the realization that we can't move forward from this. He's betrayed my trust so many times that I'd need him to verify pretty much anything for awhile, and that's no way for either of us to live. 

The fact of the matter is that we're both pretty broken, and have no business being in a relationship with each other, or anyone else right now. I truly don't believe he's a terrible person, but he has been a terrible partner. Like many of you said, he can be a good person and not be good for me. 

Last night, I chickened out. I was so scared of losing him forever that I said we should just take a break, have him fly home, and work on ourselves for a bit. There were a lot of tears, but when the conversation was over, I didn't feel better, just... stuck. 

This morning, I realized what I'd done. I did this the last time I tried to get out of an abusive relationship, and put up safeguards so I could feel comfortable leaving. My husband doesn't deserve to be led on, and I don't deserve to be unable to move on. I read through more of your messages, and I can't thank you all enough for your words of comfort, encouragement, and strength. 

The thing is, for you it's black and white. For me, my thoughts are so thoroughly clouded by emotions and history, and I have to let that all go. The best thing I can do for both of us is to give up. 

So this morning, I did. I told him that while we could take a break and try again, it would never work. I can never truly trust him again, and he wants me to change things about myself that are things I love and have no desire to change. We've been trying so hard for so long to make things work that we're just too far gone. 

There were lots of tears, but he took it well. He's agreed to a no-contest divorce, and we'll spend the next few days packing up our house before the lease is up at the end of the month. Some of you may come at me with pitch forks for not screwing him over, or breaking up last night, or leaving him to deal with the house alone, but that's okay. I'll be staying at my friend's house until my new apartment is ready, and really focusing on just working on myself. I won't help him pack unless I have someone with me. Much of the stuff is mine anyway, and I'd rather not leave it behind. You guys are right that my self-confidence has taken a nose dive lately. I have a lot of healing to do before I'm ready to consider love again, and I have two appointments scheduled with my therapist this week. This man is not a monster in my book, he's a little boy that needs to grow up. We both made our fair share of mistakes in this relationship, but rather than feeling sorry for myself, I'm choosing to take those lessons and move on. I'm the kind of person who is very good at bouncing back, it's just the getting out that's hard. Thank you all for your help in that. I wish him all the best, and simply have no desire to harbor hate in my heart. 

**Because I know how easy it is for manipulated, abused women to go right back, I've talked a lot with my family and close friends over the last 48 hours. I previously didn't share a lot of what was happening with them because I was embarrassed. Everyone always said we were  the perfect couple, and I was so ashamed of all the problems we had. I've informed these people that they are not to let me go back, should it come to that, in no uncertain terms. I don't think I'll get to that point, but I just want to be sure.

Edit: As a side note, I shared it for me, because damn I needed the loving slap in the face that this sub so gracefully provides. But I also shared it because I hope that anyone else who reads my story and sees parallels in their own life will have the strength and courage to put themselves first. If you're feeling like you need to get out, but don't feel strong enough, or like it's bad enough, or like you'll make it to the other side, feel free to message me. We're in this together. ❤️",relationship_advice
My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea,"This is my throwaway account because she know my main account. My son is 5. About 2 days ago we were out shopping and ran into a high school friend of hers. She was catching up when she told her friend that we had a son. When the old friend asked his name my wife hesitated and I told her. She had a strange look on her face then said you mean like your ex boyfriend. Our sons name is very unique to the point that I've never met another person with the same name. Now she refuses to talk to me about it. I feel betrayed and disgusted with her. It's like a switch was flipped my mind and I just can't look at her the same way. 











Update 1. Lots of questions so I'll go ahead and answer a few that have been mentioned a few times. I'm not giving out my son's name. When we discussed the name I had no idea it was her high school ex's name. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who's name was never told to me and their relationship lasted around two years. I'm upset but that doesn't automatically make make me abusive. I would never raise my hand to my wife or anyone else I care about. I will always love my son and I would never and I mean never treat him any differently. I will post an update when I talk to her probably in a day or two




Update 2. So to get some things out of the way first. The kid is mine. I have very pronounced features that he also has plus her ex was black and I'm white. I'm not  going to ""throw him away"" as so many comments suggested. When we were deciding on the name she said she remembered somebody from school who had it and instantly loved it. My wife and I both had a very promiscuous past before we met and agreed that the past should stay there so I didn't push to hard to know certain details. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who cheated on her but I never asked his name and that is my fault.

So update time. Thursday we didn't have the discussion because that is her late day at work plus this wasn't a discussion I wanted to have with our son in the house. So Thursday night when she came in I told her that Friday after work we needed to sit down and talk and if she has any plans she need to cancel. She looked very worried and said ok. Friday came and we sit down after her sister came to pick up our son for a sleep over. I asked why would not tell me where our name came from? She said she was sorry but she didn't think it was that big of a deal and I would not agree to it. I told her that it was my choice too and she took that away from me. I asked her if she would feel the same way if we had a daughter and named her after one of my ex's and she said that's different I wouldn't let that happen. She said that she knows she can disconnect the name from her ex but she wouldn't be sure I could do the same. I was floored and starting to feel sicker than I had felt. I told her that is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard come out of someone's mouth. I moved on because I had more questions and I was about to go off just on what she just said. I asked her if she still loved him and she paused for a minute then said yes but not in same way she loves me and that you don't just stop loving someone that love changes. I wanted to throw up at this point. She could see that I was very upset. She smiled at me and said I should know she only wants to be with me. I said that I needed to know how you love him. At that point she put her hand on my leg and tried to change the subject. I told her to take her fucking hand off me right now and answer the question. Her mood changed right there from wanting to move past this to no he didn't just fucking cuss at me. She said look you're upset and I get that but what is done is done so you need to get over this and move on. She got up and said I'm meeting my mom dinner I'll see you when you get home. I told her if you walk out that door then no you won't. She looked at me like I was full of shit grabbed her purse and left. I packed my bag and stayed at a friend's house last night. Right now I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what to do next.

[UPDATE] I (19F) have a date (19F) tonight. She's *visually impaired. How can I make the date go well?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmyk74/i_19f_have_a_date_19f_tonight_shes_differently/)

&#x200B;

I wanted to wait a few days before I updated you guys, just because it was a first date and we didn't know each other previously. I wanted her to still be talking to me for a few days afterwards.

&#x200B;

So, I picked her up from her house and I was in awe of how beautiful she looked. She got in and we figured out where to get fro yo, and when we got to the store, she asked me to read all the flavors to her. Of course, I did, then grabbed us some sample cups. She got pistachio, lavender blueberry, and either vanilla or classic tart. She left the last one a secret to me. I got classic tart and the lavender blueberry with some blueberries on top. We started the conversation on our frozen creations and delved into deeper conversation. Unfortunately, there were some loud little kids so we could barely hear each other, but we still enjoyed each other's company.  We got back in the car, and I went to drop her off, and she invited me in to watch a movie! She wanted to spend more time with me, yes!! She handed me the remote and said to pick whatever, so I picked one of my favorite scary movies, and started it. During the opening scene she brought up the fact if I've ever been around someone who couldn't see. I told her no, and we kinda got back into the movie, bringing up odd conversation here and there. After the movie, I went home, pretty giddy from the experience.

&#x200B;

We're still talking, thankfully, and we're planning on when to meet up next. She's just sick right now, so it's hard to plan around that. I'm excited for our next date!

\*changed title to fit her disability

TLDR; The date went amazingly and we're planning for date #2 and I really had nothing to worry about in the end.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I see a lot of people mentioning my boyfriend, which yes I do have. We're in an open relationship and he wants me to explore my sexuality before we settle down, and my date was aware of our situation. We've had a lot of talks and conversations since. Maybe I should update the post I made about him?",relationship_advice
Is it wrong of me to ask for proof of a pregnancy?,"My girlfriend [f28] and have been I [m21] a very rocky place in our relationship. I tried to break up with her a couple of weeks ago and she told me that she was pregnant, the day before this we went to bar crawl and both drank. She has displayed manipulative tendencies before and she freaks out calling me terrible for asking her to take a test. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting to see proof with my own eyes?

Update: She still has not taken a test, we had two scheduled before and she backed out, first with sending me bloody paper towels saying she's spotting. The day before the test she says there isn't a point to go anymore. 

A few days later she gets mad I don't give her a ride from her job saying, ""you're letting a pregnant woman take the bus?"" When I asked why she said there wasn't a point she replied, ""I didn't know if I wanted to keep it."" 

The second time I made an appointment but she said she wouldn't go because she hadn't heard of this place before. 

We have one this Saturday but we got into a bad argument last night because someone who messaged me claiming to be her husband said she was 35 not 28, when I confronted her she freaked out for a couple days then she admitted she was 35. This was a week ago and she gets mad I bring it up saying I make her feel terrible about her age. 

The man also sent some photo's including a fake pregnancy test box. She says he is out to ruin her life but he lived with for the first 5-6 months that we dated. 

Her biggest claim to not taking a pregnancy test that she had a miscarriage in Oct. When I was on a vaction. So she felt telling me or anyone would jinx it.

A big thing I would like to point out is I'm not perfect,  I can honestly claim to never have been a good boyfriend.

UPDATE: Tricky areas with consent in my relationship,"ORIGINAL POST:  [Tricky areas with consent in my relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a3lqwd/tricky_areas_with_consent_in_my_relationship/?st=JPL470BX&sh=cd0a8bd7) 


Wow. 
To start, I would just like to say how grateful I am to everyone who commented. 
The advice I received was so kind, understanding and helpful. I was so overcome with gratitude. I didn't respond to many because I didn't know how to properly express how incredible it was that strangers would take time to be so kind to me. 

I'm really sorry for the late update. I wanted to take my time and read every comment. I wanted to let every comment really stick to my brain. 
I took time to let everyone's words stew in my mind. I did a lot of self reflection. 
I realised a lot of things. 

I broke up with him. 
It was so so hard, and I am sad, but I understand that it was definitely for the best. I was so unhappy. 
He was very against the idea of breaking up but I just told him I'd decided and there was nothing else to say on it. 

There was so much I left out of my post. My gut told me that what he did to me was wrong. After reading everyone's comments I think I was very right. 
He wasn't very kind to me, honestly. He would get angry when I would get anxious and he would call me a ""cunt"" or a ""stupid bitch"" when we would fight over stupid things. He would have sex with me when I was asleep. He would call me pathetic. 

I mistook his affection for being a good partner. I mistook him kissing me and calling me baby for being kind. 
These are kind actions, yes, but they don't hold the same weight when he's disrespecting my boundaries in bed and disrespecting my feelings in life. 

I think it's time I cared for me.  I was desperately trying to make him like me, dulling down every part of me that is interesting so I'm a ""cute"" and ""domestic"" partner. Ignoring my feelings and needs so he would be comfortable. This was hurting me so much. 
I didn't even realise it until other people pointed out that my ""perfect"" boyfriend was acting kind of shitty. 

It was a bit of an epiphany. I feel better than I have for so long. I feel happy and I feel hopeful. I want to love myself. He really skewed how I felt about my sexuality and myself. I really want to care for myself. I want to fix the ways I was hurt and I want to take time to be single and heal before I find a super kind, respectful partner in the future (or don't!! Thank you to everyone who made me realise I don't even need a partner to be happy and successful!). I've spent time with my friends. Apologised for the way I had distanced myself from them during my relationship. One of my friends and I have booked an overseas trip for after graduation. I'm so excited for it. 

I'm so excited to discover who I am without him. I'm looking forward to the future. I've never felt more hopeful. 

A lot of people said I was raped. This is a very hard thing for me to come to terms with. I understand why people said it. Some of the acts felt very assaulting, and if it was anyone else aside from me telling me that their lover had done to them what mine had done to me, I would also say it was sexual assault. 

To be completely honest, I am struggling with the idea that it classifies as rape - I feel a bit like a fraud. Someone said to call my situation rape was completely delegitimising actual rape victims. While so many kind people stood up for me against this person, what they said stuck and I feel a bit worried. I have accepted that it was sexual assault. I'm still struggling with the word rape. 

I asked my mum to book me in for therapy again. She asked if I was alright and I left it kind of vague. I just said that I was stressed about school - I still feel a bit nervous about telling the people in my life about why I ended the relationship and what was happening. I hope I can get over that. I had a therapist I saw after my cancer and I have an appointment for next week. 

I'm going to try really hard to make my life and my world about me :)

Thank you again to everyone. Thank you so so much. I would've stayed with him if it wasn't for the (sometimes harsh, mostly kind, always eye opening) advice I received from 1.3K people!! Wow! That's so many people. 

I probably would have married him. I never would have left him if it hadn't been for the slap in the face the response to my post caused. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. 

I'm so happy. It's a bittersweet kind of happy. He was my best friend, my person, I loved him and I loved his family. I'm sad to leave him and to make the call. But my heart and brain are more important than that. 
I feel relief. I don't feel like I have to always look gorgeous. I feel like I can do whatever the heck I want, and it's so wonderful. 

I'm free :) 

TLDR: I broke up with him! I'm happy!",relationship_advice
I(F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(F60s) and suddenly he wants back in,"I will be rambling a little as I am very mad right now. Sorry for my bad English. It is not my first language

My Ex and I were married for well over 5 years and together for 10 . His mother was a nightmare. She would spent her time belitteling me and tried humiliating me. I could take it as i loved my husband and didn't want to make him choose between her or me.

Of course I would always tell him what she would be doing and he would always brush it off as her being ""a loving and over protecting mom ""

When she would say something racist ( I am Hispanic and they are white) he would laugh it off, when she would make a comment of me being a gold digger ( even tho I earned more than my Ex) he would just say ""Oh mom "" . He would also get mad at me if I ever stood up for myself.

But the straw that broke the camels back is when we had our daughter. My MIL would always try to parent her and say that i would do something wrong .

My daughter has an irritable colon and she can not ingest any kind of fucking oils or artificial things. And guess what that looney of a Woman did??

She fed my 3 year old daughter essential oils( she is not anti vaxx , just very stupid)  to make her go to sleep . She was in the ICU. I had it and i confronted my husband who said "" she only did what she thought was best "".

I lost it . I went to my parents and drafted a divorce agreement . ( Thats the best course of action. I saw a post earlier describing a situation that is much more dangerous than mine involving allergens and an epipen. )

His face was like that Pikachu Meme when i served him . He didn't know why i was doing that because we were ""happy"".

So now a year has passed and my life was hell.  My Monster in law tried every dirty trick in the book to take my Daugther . To name a few :

* She accused my brother of molesting her
* She accused me of neglect
* She accused me of taking drugs and leaving them in reach of a toddler ( I take thyroxin for heavens sake !)
* She accused me of endangering my daughter by leaving random man in my house
* the list goes on

During this time the excuse of my ex was that i *broke his heart and i had to undertstand his mother. She only wants whats best for him.*

Luckily i got good representation and even got my daughter full time  minus some weekends or visitation . I could prove that my daughter was endangered by his mother.

So now to the advice part.

I knew that my ex needed to be permanently in my life because of my daughter. And i was learning to live with that . He was very cold with me because again.. i broke his heart .

Now 2 things have come together :

* My ex BIL got married to an African American woman, so ofcourse my ex MIL flipped
* I started dating again

my BIL is a great guy and he actually stood up for his wife ( !!! go figure it is possible). I stay in contact with him because we are friends and hewas a mediator and fought with his brother quite often .So my BIL actually stood up for his wife and my ex husband got his panties in a twist, my BIL basically opened his eyes how shitty he was being. And that their mom treated me the same way she treated his wife. And finally my dense ex started understanding.

They guy I am seeing is great . I have even met his parents and his mother is normal . She treats me like a human being and has invited me allready to many family functions and tries to make me and my daughter feel welcomed . My ex got wind from the situation trough a mutual friend and guess who is now flipping his shit?

He started bringing flowers and chocolate ( I don't even like chocolate!!!) to pick up our Daugther. He sends me cards and sms with hearts and who knows what .

Yesterday was the ""best thing"". My daughter was at my mothers place and i was at home with my boyfriend. He appears infront of my door crying and clutching my engagement ring begging me to come back.

I said no and that he should go away. He wouldn't and started demanding that i come out to talk to him. My boyfriend told him that he would call the police ,and in his pathetic fashion  he threatened to beat my boyfriend up.

I closed the door and let him pound sand .

Today he picked up my daughter for a day trip and when they came back my daughter was asking if i loved my boyfriend more than her .

Now I am at a loss to what to do. I allready told my daughter that it was imposible because my love for her is infinite and there is nothing bigger than infinite.

But now i know that my ex is trying to make my daughter hate me .I am at a loss because i won't use my daughter as amunition. But also....what the hell am i supposed to do??I will never return with that man but i can't take the father of my daughter. Do you guys have any advice?


Edit /mini update : thanks you all! I needed to vent and was feeling helpless and am so thankfull for you wonderful people.

I talked to my lawyer who confirmed that we could have a case for domestic violence by proxy. A social worker will be visiting us in the next few days to talk to my daughter about this.


Edit : because apparently people want to spin the world narrative on me.
I don't care if he wants me back I don't love him anymore and will never get back together with him
Staying for the sake of our daughter would not make sense as it has been proven that the kids grow up happier and divorced homes than unhappy homes.

I tried talking to my husband when we were still married and he would always brush it off. He would brush off everything his mother did. I complained to him and told him we needed go to therapy wich he declined.

He has his daughter on the weekends. The court gave ne majority custody because of his mother.

Jeezs guys I guess in some of yalls eyes I should have kept being by my ex side às a submissive bimbo.",relationship_advice
Update My wife is going to gave sex with other men,"Sorry I posted this update in the wrong sub. Here we go. My wife and I calmed down on Sunday to discuss this mess. I had been avoiding her all week until I could get my head around it. We took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. My wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. She had been rehearsing on what to say. When it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. She wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. She went on about not having other sexual partners etc. What she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

I told her that I would not , could not do this. I reminded her of the vows before God, family and friends we took on fidelity. I told her how she had violated the trust that I had for her. Look I understand what she is feeling. I know she wants new experiences. I told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. Maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. We never had a discussion about this. 

I told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this I was seeing a lawyer Tuesday to start divorce proceedings. At this point if she said she would not go thru with this I do not think I could not think she could be cheating at some point. That is where the trust comes in. I think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. I think equal division of assests, I expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. We will have to sell the house and each downsize. We actually had a good talk. Papers are being drawn. We hope  to get through this by fall.

I did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. Did not mention the lifestyle change. They can talk to their mom themselves. I will always love my wife. I will take the high road. I know many of you wanted scortched earth but I can not do that, its not me. I do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub. They thought I was trying to manipulate her into staying by using the marriage vows. I got to say that my religious up bringing has set my morals that I live by. This works for me. There are some that say its the 21st century no one lives that way anymore. There are many things I see others do and say that I do not agree with, but I do not try to impose my morals on them and conversly you should not denigrate what I believe. Remember my wife and I believed the same for close to 30 years, only recently has she made a change. I never held her down she was always free to chose. I believe in God and believe in my vows before him. Sorry enough soap box.

Last I want to thank all of your kind replies. I was overwhelmed. I only wish I could have replied to each and everyone. Thank you for letting me talk this out.",relationship_advice
Update: I (34M) think my wife (32F) is cheating on me.,"Original post from a few weeks ago:I travel a lot for work. I'm usually gone Tuesday through Thursday 3 times a month. My wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. We have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
About 6 months ago I caught my wife in a lie. Not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when I knew she wasn't. It bothered me but not to the point where I was extremely concerned. Then a week before the 4th of July I came home early from my trip I wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. I had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip I booked for us to go to St Martin for a week. It was late when I got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had FaceTimed about three hours earlier so I could see her and the kids. She never mentioned anything about going out that night. When I got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. I texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. I said thats funny because I just got home and you're not here. 
When she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn't want me upset that she wasn't home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), I didn't really buy her excuse,  but I had no proof and she wasn't admitting to anything. 
The next day I ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. I haven't told her about it. And since then I have caught her in several lies, and I'm not even trying to set her up. She is just telling me she is at one place and I can see she is clearly not. 
Should I confront her with what I did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

TLDR I caught my wife in a lie so I got a gps for her car. Then I caught her in multiple lies.

I hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. My wife has been acting normal all day. We had plans tonight, I canceled told her I was not feeling well (which is the truth). I don't think anything else will happen until I leave Tuesday morning. I plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on Monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer I'm sure he can point me in the right direction. Thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. I'll update when the PI does his thing.

Update: so I hired a private investigator to follow my wife when I left on Tuesday. He first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. He told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or CC. She left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. He witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. He followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. He was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. He has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. They were there for about 3.5 hours. He then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife's car was parked. She went home and didn't leave the rest of the day.

Wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. That night around 9:15 (I FaceTimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. She again met with the same women. This time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. She was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

So there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. I really don't know what to do now. The PI was pretty expensive I'm not sure I want to hire him again. Not sure if I should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

Update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. I kept the PI following her when I have been out of town. It has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. This Wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. The PI got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. The kiss is not something just friends would do. This is the first real evidence I have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
I flew home a day early, and last night I confronted her with the photos. I didn't tell her how I got them or that I had hired a PI. I asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. She basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. She then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. I couldn't believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
I haven't moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, I'm still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

Update: so I have the woman's name,age and where she works from the PI. She is single no kids, she has a Facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. No instagram or Twitter that he can find either. I think I'm done with him he found out enough.",relationship_advice

First of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. I never imagined that I would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. When I posted, I was in a pretty bad place (I think I typed the post out on my bathroom floor where I had been crying). Thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. Also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. I read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. I appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

Special thank you to u/Janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. I got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

About two days after I posted, I told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. He was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. He drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while I peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. I was positive for hCG so the pregnancy was real. I was about five weeks. He held me as I cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

That day, I called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for Wednesday. I was early enough to take Mifeprex (the pill). On Tuesday, my best friend (the one that I mentioned in my original post) finally came back from Africa and I told her immediately. She hugged me close and I cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

On the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. I took Mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. Right after I took the Mifeprex, I felt complete and utter relief. It felt better than the day I finished all of my college applications. All of my stress instantly dissipated. I knew I was going to be okay and that I had my life back on track. My friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. I'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and I'm so thankful for them.

So yes, I had the abortion and I feel completely relieved.

One thing that I did do that I said I probably wasn't was that I told ""Nick"". I was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. But I hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and I thought that if I do end up getting a position at the lab, I would see him everyday. It would be very difficult for me to see him and know that I kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. He's also someone that never gave me any red flags and I was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. So I texted him the day after I made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. I told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him I already schdued the abortion. He was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. He said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. He then got up and hugged me again. He offered to come with me and pay for the pill and I told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. He told me to call him if anything came up or if I needed anything. I nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. And that was that. 

I could tell he was relieved and I expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

In all, I made the right choice and had an amazing support system. Thank you especially to Reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while I was at my lowest. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

TL;DR: Got the abortion and told Nick about it. I feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. Life's good and back on track.

General advice for anyone trying to decide whether to stay in or go back to a relationship,"If you are wondering whether you should stay in a relationship or go back to your ex, I have a mental exercise for you.

&#x200B;

Close your eyes and imagine you are holding a puppy- any breed you like. Feel it's warm weight against your chest, it's soft sweet breath on your neck. Stroke the puppy's soft fur, feel the fineness of its skin and the delicate bones beneath, touch it's tiny paws, smooth and soft against your skin, kiss its little domed skull and look into its gentle, trusting eyes.

&#x200B;

Are you holding your puppy? Do you feel its softness, it's warmth, its vulnerability- that soft little mouth, peach like nose and all those fragile little bones? Do you feel its weight in your arms, snuggling up against your heart- trusting and relying on you.

&#x200B;

OK, now give that puppy to your partner/ ex.

&#x200B;

If the breath stills in your lungs, if your heart clenches, if you hesitate, then you need to ask yourself why.

&#x200B;

Is it because they are a bully- who would shout at and hit the puppy, bruising that thin skin and breaking those fragile bones? Is it because you know that they'd neglect the puppy, leaving it alone, possibly hungry and cold and ignoring its cries for attention and affection. Is it because they are contradictory- a person who is nice whilst the world is going their way but who will turn on you for breathing if something goes wrong in their life?

And, if you'd hesitate over giving that puppy to your partner, why the hell are you giving yourself to them?! Aren't you worth as much as an imaginary dog?

&#x200B;

Too often, in life, we seriously undervalue ourselves and excuse away behaviours which we'd find inexcusable if another person was subjected to them. However, we are just as vulnerable and breakable as the next person- and just as valuable.

&#x200B;

So, don't put up with behaviours which you wouldn't wish on a dog. If someone abused a puppy, you'd take that puppy out of the situation- do the same for yourself. If someone ignored their puppy, spending all of their time with other people/ doing other things, you'd know that the puppy was not getting the physical, mental and emotional stimulation it needed and you'd find someone who had time for the puppy- again, do the same for yourself. If someone abandoned a puppy, leaving it crying, you wouldn't chase after the person to give the puppy back to them... You're getting the drift?

&#x200B;

Value yourself. And, if it helps, think of your soul as that puppy you imagined. Look into its trusting eyes- its relying on you to find someone kind, someone patient, someone with love and time to give. You are responsible for your own health and happiness and that loving, caring person might be sitting there lonely, waiting for someone just like you to come into their life.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_EDIT\_\_\_\_\_

  
Someone asked ""What if you know you mistreat the puppy yourself too?""

The answer is simple: take a long, hard look at how you treat the people in your life and work out how you can change your behaviour so that you can treat 'the puppy' (e.g. friends/family/your S.O) well.

We're all 'bad' people to some extent; all greedy, lazy, selfish, hypocritical, temperamental, judgemental, cowardly and even cruel. However, what you are isn't the end of the story. A 'good' person is someone who looks at their options, second by second, and always tries to chooses to take the better path; it's not the only path or the easiest path but they choose the right path because they have self-respect.

These 'choices' can happen at the deepest of levels; whatever people say, we can actually control our thoughts and our feelings if we put in the effort: for example, you might look at someone and think 'ugly' but, if you're trying to be a better person, you'll then think to yourself 'No, stop that. It's unkind and shallow'. Or you might see someone with something you want and feel a stab of jealousy, then think 'why am I jealous, I've got my friends, my family, etc and that's more important than x'. Choices- every moment of every day- and if you try to think only kind, rational thoughts and feel only kind, positive feelings, then you'll find it easier and easier to do the right thing.

It is the choices we make in life which are important; make the kindest, most selfless and thoughtful choice and you'll find that you are happier because you'll be able to look in the mirror and see someone you respect.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_EDIT 2\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I've written an additional edit because certain questions/comments seem to reoccur and, as there have been so many comments, my original answers to substantially similar questions/comments are now a couple of pages back and I know repeating/copy-pasting annoys people.

&#x200B;

Edit 2A:

If you are allergic to or don't like dogs, you can also visualise another type of animal or a human baby if that is more relevant to you.

&#x200B;

Edit 2B:

A number of people have been making comments along the lines of 'my Ex/S.O. is great with animals/loves dogs but treats/treated me badly"" or ""is a vile person""

If your ex/S.O would treat/treats their dog better than they treat you:

a. make a list, one with the differences between their behaviour to you and their behaviour towards the dog;

b. do the visualisation again, but imagine that they'd treat the puppy just like they treated you.

&#x200B;

You wouldn't leave an abused/neglected dog with someone just because they were kind to their other pet and, more importantly...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*You are more important than an imaginary dog!\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Edit 2C:

Emotional distress. Some abusive behaviours, e.g. adultery, won't affect a dog like they do a human partner. However, the important point is that pain and distress caused. If a person does something knowing it will cause severe hurt, then use a comparative physical hurt in your visualisation.

&#x200B;

Edit 2D.

Finally, people have also commented that this doesn't apply to situations where people are just incompatible. No, it doesn't; it was designed to help people with high levels of empathy to realise that they need to protect themselves as much as they'd protect an animal.

&#x200B;

However, that said, anyone who has ever bought a dog from a reputable breeder will know that great humans will not be allowed to buy a great dog if they are fundamentally incompatible. If you want a collie and your favourite past-time is sitting on your backside, no reputable breeder will let you walk away with a pup because, although you might be the nicest, kindest person in the world, you will be driven up the wall by an energetic dog who will be literally running up the walls if they don't spend hours hiking around the countryside.

Where there's incompatibility, it often leads to both parties making compromises for the duration of their relationship. People rarely change in fundamentals and you need to ask yourself; 1. what compromise/s do we need to make to meet each other half way? 2. am I willing/able to make my compromises? 3. is my S.O. also willing/able to make their compromises? 4. will we both be able to live, long term, in the compromise situation? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you are going to get frustrated with each other, the frustration will probably turn into irritation and the irritation will probably turn into recrimination because we all, secretly think 'if they love me, they will change' without asking ourselves 'if I love them, why don't I change?'

So, if you are a collie and your S.O is a couch potato, then you'll either have to accept that you'll get 50% of the exercise you need and they will have to do 50% more than they want OR you go and do your exercise whilst they play video-games and you meet up for meals. Or you break up and make sure that, in the future, you automatically rule out anyone who is not in running gear!",relationship_advice
My Secret Marriage (24/M),"Not the typical post on here but i don't know where else to post this and i'm so excited about it that i want to share it with someone. And what better listening ears than the fine folks of Reddit, am i right?

My lady and i will be celebrating 4 years together this coming May and are in the midst of planning a wedding this November. I proposed to her this past Fall after lurking on this sub and reading some advice that put things in perspective for me and made me realize i really wanted it. Through all of the stress of planning and financing a wedding ourselves, we have realized that we are spending WAY too much time worrying about what will make the event memorable for everyone else and forgetting the most important part, us. So we decided to make a decision for us, to keep explicitly between us and go ahead and tie the knot early. As of Friday February 22nd, 2019, we got married! We have been trying to keep it a secret as the only person we have told about it is our 2 year old daughter who has no idea what we are talking about, but my beautiful wife has agreed to let me share the story with Reddit. 

I want to thank everyone on this sub for posting your stories and advice. Even though i haven't posted any of my own stories, a lot of the advice that's tossed around on this sub has indirectly helped me in big ways. You guys are awesome!

Also, a major bonus that our anniversary is on Steve Irwin's birthday.  ",relationship_advice
I just found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends was arrested for child pornography and molestation. I am crying and speechless and lost.,"I have let his wife know that I love her and am here for her for anything at all. I live a few hours away and can't afford to go see her due to work, but she probably doesn't want company.

Apparently he was first arrested a while ago for internet child porn. I've visited them since then, never would have thought it, never. 

He was arrested for uploading child porn. Out on bail. Told to stay offline. While compiling evidence for his jury trial, they realized it was him in a video of a little girl performing oral sex. She was later identified as his daughter. 

I have known him and his wife since middle school. Stayed close. Visited as often as possible. Love(d) both of them to pieces. Stayed at their house with my kids.

Known their little girl since she was born, obviously. Helped with her diapers on occasion. Last time I visited I thought, she's being a bit of a brat, you guys should check that! Now I feel like a piece of shit.

I had absolutely no idea. I don't go on FB often anymore. She posted asking people not to repost the news article. I was like, what? So I googled. Jesus christ. 

Now I know. I really don't know anyone. No one does. And one of my best friends and her sweet kids are having their lives turned around and fucked up and I can't do anything. 

Oh, and when I logged into FB messenger to tell her I'm here for her, I have a message from his mother asking what's going on because she can't reach him. 

Sorry, I really needed to get that out. Thanks.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I(28m) wrongly accused my girlfriend (24F) of cheating. I don't know where to go from here.,"So, my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw31od/i_28m_wrongly_accused_my_gf_24f_of_cheating_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) got a lot of responses and I decided to do a prompt update as a lot has changed in just the last day and I wanted to update anyone who was interested and/or concerned for my girlfriend. 

I read your responses and decided to make a big apology to my girlfriend for how I behaved. However, before I got chance, she arrived at the house. 
I'll hold my hands up and say that this isn't the first time I've jumped to conclusions and pretty much since we got together, I've had a habit of winding myself up and then checking her phone/accounts. I know it's wrong, but I always felt if I found something I'd be justified which is so messed up, I know. 

My ex did cheat on me. Well, she had an affair and left me for the other dude. I guess I projected this onto my current girlfriend. My girlfriend never, ever has given me any reason to doubt her and treats me better than I've ever been treated before. She's down to earth, honest, open, funny, kind, beautiful and she gives me to opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with no judgement. 

I don't know why I assumed the worst of her, I really don't. 
To answer a common question - she has online banking app on her phone and it's the same passcode as her mobile so I could log on. Super super fucked up, I know. 

When she arrived at the house, she was calm but sad. She explained that she knew I'd always check her phone and that I'd be ""off"" with her anytime she went out with friends but that she always hoped over time, if she proved herself, I'd let go. When she found out that I'd done what I did, it hurt even more because she was trying to do something nice for me. 
She told me she loves me but she finds herself justifying every activity she does, over explaining herself and told me she has real, genuine anxiety whenever she's out with friends because she knows I'll be sat at home imagining scenarios of where she could be. She found herself withdrawing from friends. 

She told me we were over. Not because she doesn't love me, because she can't devote her life to someone who only sees the worst in her. She told me that I could have just spoke to her and she'd be honest but that she knows even if she did, I wouldn't believe her unless I could prove it and she's probably right. I don't know why, but I know in myself I would not fully believe her because I mean, of course she'd say that, right? Anyway... She left me. Packed up her things and went. 

I know her, she's a strong minded woman. It really is over and I've never felt worse. But she's right, I'm not ready to trust someone yet and even in our last moments, she gave me the confidence and motivation to get help and be better, even if she won't be there to see the change. I know she loves me and that fact alone makes it worth changing myself. 

I'm not going to try and win her back, because I can't promise I won't do it again. I'm heartbroken and hurt but she verbalised it in such a way, it really hit home. She calmly explained it to me in a way that only showed me her true love for me. 

I'm just so sorry for hurting her, I guess. 

But, thank you all for sharing your opinions and giving me some home truths. I appreciate it more than you know. 

This is it for now, hopefully this time next year I'll be a new man and be able to treat the next woman who loves me, the way my ex girlfriend deserved to be treated. 

**Tl;Dr** my gf left me. She made the right choice. I'm reflecting and moving forward.",relationship_advice
My (33 F) husband (44 M) does not want me to reply to the letter I received from the boy I gave up for adoption when I was 13.,"I had a baby when I was 13. I was a victim of incest. I gave him up for adoption. 

I have always prayed that he turned out okay and that his adoptive parents were good to him. He is 20 now and wrote me a letter (I chose open adoption). It sounds like he has a wonderful life. I really want to reply and I'm opening to meeting of he wants to. 

My husband who I married when I was 25 does not want me to reply. He said I should focus on raising our 3 daughters (8, 6, 2) and forget the past. 

Is he right? Or is it okay if I want to communicate with the boy I gave up?",relationship_advice
My (23f) special needs brother (28m) is a savant with mixing beats. My other brother (18m-golden child) stole one of his beats with no credit and has been signed to a major Christian rock label. I'm so pissed but my parents say to stay out of it. What can I do?,"So this could go on for pages but I'll try to make it short. My older brother Timothy has severe autism and will never be able to be his own legal entity so as of right now, my parents have legal guardianship over him. I love Timothy so much and when my parents pass I will become his legal guardian per thier trust.

Timothy is absolute savant when it comes to mixing beats. They are true pieces of art but the way he wants is that they stay his. He has sold a few with the consent of my parents to national advertising companies and made a decent amount of money that went into his trust.

I also have a younger brother who is the literal spoiled golden child of the family. We have never gotten along and I barely have even brotherly love for him. He had gotten into the Christian rock genere and since he has a great voice and is a decent guitar player has found a decent amount of success with paid gigs at mega churches in our region.

Well recently my younger brother wrote a new song that has really taken off on Christian radio and in August he was signed to a really large (for the genre) contract with a Christian recording house. The problem is, younger bro literally stole one of Timothy's favorite beats for the hook to his song. It's so blatent as to be undeniable. M

Timothy is crushed over this because the beat in question was one of his favorites and he wanted to keep it his forever. I think at the very least he deserves a song writer credit and some of the money from the contract since the cat is out of the bag. Younger brother refuses to do any of this and claims it's his song. 

I've talked to my parents and a. They tell me to stay out of it since they are Timothy's legal guardians it's thier choice and b. Accuse me of being jealous of younger brothers success and trying to ruin his career. I am FURIOUS with my parents and brother and don't know what to do. It's so unfair I can't even sleep at night.

I just wanted to thank you all for the kind and wonderful support I received, it truly helps me get through the darkest time in my life.

I've blocked him on everything, he has resorted to trying to contact my friends and begging them to get me to give him a second chance. They've stood strong by me and have blocked him as well now.

My lovely boss transferred me to another branch of the business and I have moved state and asked the postal manager to withhold all my details.

I now house share with another person (mainly to feel more safe) and I'm starting to rebuild my life. I'm not dating at the moment but have been asked out a few times. I've picked up doing culinary classes and have a trip booked to europe and Egypt in 2 weeks time. I've discovered that I love not sharing my ice cream and I read a lot more, because I can. 

I've been told I'm beautiful and I'm starting to believe it once again. My ex made me realise that I don't need anyone to feel great about myself but that in the future when I'm ready, I'll be with someone who is deserving of me and someone who is worth building a kind and wonderful life with.

I've reconciled that I got a bad seed before but that hasn't tainted the entire tree. Like a friend of mine said, I'm a bad bitch who is soul rich. I appreciate all of you. Happy belated international women's day.

"My [30M] wife [29F] more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. I don't know what to do.","Me \[30M\] and my wife \[29F\] have been married 5 years and have been together for 8 years. We met through an internship in university (she came from Korea, i came from Canada), we ended up both doing a long distance relationship thing for a year before we both ended up moving to Toronto for jobs as developers. 

To make things complicated her family has never really approved of me. I know very basic Korean that she taught me, but her family up until now has cut contact with me (they didn't come to the wedding, nor have they seen their grand daugthers). However she has always been extremely independent, and despises the idea that her family can control any part of her life, so she asked me to marry her (i was fine with that) only after living together for 8 months. 

Two years ago she gave birth to a pair of wonderful baby girls. However it became very obvious something was extremely wrong, she became a whole different kind of person after the birth. She became extremely protective and borderline paranoid of anyone other than me or her looking after her kids. 

Apparently the idea of her becoming a stay at home mom was insulting to her and she told me over and over that i needed to become a stay at home dad. Since she was the bread winner it was fine for me. About 6 months ago she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and was given medication that made her much better (no more bizarre mood swings, or picking fights for no reason). 

Last weekend was the first time i have had some time off from the kids, i was going to my friends bachelor party at his cottage for the weekend and my wife was going to look after the kids. 

On Sunday morning i got a phone call from my sister who told me:

* My wife dropped the kids off with her as there was some emergency at the office on Saturday.
* She didn't come back to get them and it was now Sunday
* Her phone wasn't responding to her messages/calls. 

I freaked out and rushed home, only to find pretty much all her stuff gone. She left me a single page note that was basically told me that she was going back home to be with her family, and she was ""cutting ties"" with me as she couldn't be the person ""i wanted her to be"", and asked that i respect her decision. She also closed our joint bank accounts saying i had ""no right"" to that money as she earned it. 

I talked to one of her friends from work and she said she told me she put in her two weeks notice over a month ago so this has been planned for awhile.

I am pretty much a confused mess, my family is helping out, but its complicated. I talked to her parents and they basically refused to talk to me, and demanded that i leave her or them alone. I brought up their grand-children and her father told me point blank they aren't his.

What am i supposed to be doing. I don't really understand. 

TLDR; Wife ditched me and our kids, took our money and went back to Korea. I can't get in touch with her at all and this was all planned way in advance.",relationship_advice
Caught my (m34) wife (f30) cheating on me and she is furious with me,"A week ago my wife said she was going out with univesity friends after some volunteer shifts that she does. She said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. This is very unusual so I started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. She refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. 

She continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so I became worried and very suspicious. Not proud of it but I went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. This led me to check her Internet history and I found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.

I went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so I confronted her when I got home that evening. She admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. When I told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. Obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account I can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.

So I'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when I bring it up. She says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because I have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. 

I'm losing my mind because I still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. Shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because I was so angry the evening after she was out all night. She doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when I bring up the night she simply says I told you everything I'm not gonna talk about it. This,  even though her story is provably false.

I feel like I'm purgatory now. Together for 10 years and I don't even know this person.

I need to know is this kind of behaviour typical for someone who has been having an affair? 

If so are there ways I can get her to admit what she has done, or at least be willing to answer my questions in a believable way?

Is there a way I can move forward because everything I do is hitting a wall.",relationship_advice

My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),"**TLDR; I went through my sister's texts and found out she was sleeping with my stepdad. My mom is at my aunts house now and I don't know where my stepdad and sister are. I don't know what to do or think about all of this.**

Throwaway account because I don't want this awful part of my life on my main account. Don't really care if my sister ends up seeing it because there's obviously nothing here that she doesn't already know!!

The title is pretty self explanatory. I'm still processing everything so I apologize if this post is a mess. Some context: my sister and I have different dads (my mom has been married twice, had my sister out of wedlock). My dad died when I was 11 and my mom married my stepdad 2 years later.

I came home pretty high last night around 1am thinking everyone was asleep. I was about to walk into the kitchen but jumped half a foot because my stepdad was standing there in the dark leaning over the sink. He had to have heard me but didn't turn around, and being there kind of creeped me out so I went upstairs. I heard someone throwing up in the bathroom and when I looked out the window I didn't see my sisters car (she moved out but ran out of money half a year ago and moved back into the basement) so I knew it was my mom in the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure she was okay but she didn't answer and I could hear her crying. I assumed she wanted to be alone and I figured me being high off my ass wasn't going to help so I just went to bed.

When I came downstairs this morning I couldn't find anyone, and there's usually someone there to drive me to school (I'm in high school, don't drive, and live out of district). We never leave later than 7 but I still couldn't find anyone by 7:30 and no one was answering my calls/texts. I still felt weird about last night but thought maybe it just seemed weird because I was baked and tired but it was obvious at that point that something was going on.

I got a text from my mom around 8 saying she was sorry but everyone is okay and she'll write me a note for school tomorrow. She wouldn't tell me what was going on but my sister ended up coming home looking like shit. Whenever I tried asking her what was going on she'd either ignore me or tell me to fuck off, and she was frantically going into the basement and bringing up her things and putting them in her car.

I could tell she was disoriented and at one point she left her phone on the kitchen table and went to the bathroom. I grabbed her phone (yeah yeah I know reddit is judgmental about that shit and I get it but I had no idea what was going on with my family and I was so worried I felt sick) and saw she had been texting my mom apologizing over and over and saying she knows that she's a slut and said something about how Shaun (our stepdad) isn't even related to her and that it ""wasn't as many times as you think."" I don't remember exactly what else she said because I only pulled random words from it before my sister came out and saw me but I pieced two and two together. She ripped the phone out of my hand so hard her nail cut my thumb and when I asked if she fucked Shaun she didn't answer and got in her car and left.

I was shaking like crazy and felt like I was going to be sick. I couldn't stand being in our house alone so I got my boyfriend to leave school during lunch and come get me. I've been at his house since and haven't heard from anyone all day except for my aunt (mom's sister) who texted me asking where I was. She said my mom was staying with her and wanted to make sure I was safe and told me to just stay at my bfs if I could.

I don't know what the fuck to do in this situation. I'm so grossed out and I can't help but think about all the signs and ways that we didn't notice. Like I said my sister moved into the basement and my stepdad's office is down there, none of us have a reason to go down there aside from doing laundry so it very well could have happened there.

An hour or two ago I started freaking out because I remembered a few weeks ago I went to my sister's friend's house with her and they were asking me if I've started watching porn yet. My sister brought up all this stuff she had saved on her phone and most of it was shit like ""sexy stepdaughter caught masturbating"" or ""stepdaughter begging for cock"" or something like that idk. I asked her why she watches stuff like that and she told me to ignore the titles, if you turn the sound off the story doesn't matter... When I brought it up with my bf he said that there's a lot of that kind of stuff going around right now and some people do watch it for the visuals and ignore the title/context. But he agrees that it's probably too much of a coincidence.

For a bunch of unrelated reasons my mom and I have both had kind of a bad relationship with my sister for a long time, but since she moved back in we've been working really hard to improve things with her and I finally started to feel like we were real sisters. I really want to believe that it was all my stepdad taking advantage of her (that sounds bad when I type it out but I just can't understand why she'd do this to my mom) but with the porn and stuff idk. Plus she was apologizing to my mom a lot and my mom didn't seem to be answering her. My sister was already in college when my mom met Shaun so maybe he never thought of her as a kid?

I really don't know if he's the kind of person who does this (I mean I know he did, but yeah I don't know the full story yet) because to be honest I just don't know him that well. He married my mom pretty soon after my dad died and I don't think any of us were ready but my mom was lonely. I don't know what she sees in him, he's pretty boring and works a lot and just watches sports and stuff but he never struck me as being a bad person.

This is getting rambly and I don't know what details are important so I'm sorry if parts don't make sense. I just needed to get it out and see if anyone else has gone through this or has any suggestions about what to do? Is this a common thing that happens??

My boyfriend thinks I should give my mom space even though I want to comfort her because we're both still processing it. I don't know where my stepdad and sister are and I kind of want to know but also really don't.

Edit: I couldn't find the edit option earlier, so I put a response in the comments. Please read it before commenting (Is there a way I can pin my own comment below?)

Edit edit: I realize now based off of the comments that I didn't explain this very well: my sister and I have different dads. My mom had my sister when she was really young/not married, then married my dad and had me, and then married Shaun. Shaun is technically my sister's stepdad too, but she refuses to call him that. She had already moved out and wasn't really around when he was dating my mom and moved in, so he's even less of a father figure to her than he is to me (he really isn't like a dad to me and we aren't close at all, but calling him my stepdad is just easier and technically correct).",relationship_advice

"My brother [19M] and I [21M] have reason to believe that our sister [16F] is gay. She has been depressed for years, we have super religious parents who said that being gay ""won't work in this house"". How can I show support/help her without making her feel like she has to reveal anything to me?","I'll give you guys a bit of a background here. My sister has always been interested in ""male stuff.""  Hanging out with my brother and I all the time growing up probably influenced that. However, she always dressed cutesy, was obsessed with Bieber, did a lot of stuff that you'd ""expect"" from a girl. Most of that was my parents, though. As she has gotten older, her style has changed, she has many LGBTQ+ friends (this is not an assumption this is a fact). Her closest ""friend"" is Mary (fake name), who I'm pretty sure is her girlfriend. They spend the night with each other doing ""sleepovers"" 3-4 nights a week, 5-6 nights during this past summer. They always cuddle and are very loving toward each other. Today was when I went from 75% sure to 90% sure that she is gay: my brother's friend, who is friends with siblings of my sister's friends, accidentally revealed in front of him that my sister is gay and backtracked and claimed to be joking, as they know that he is a friend of my brother.

My sister has acted quite sad and depressed for 2-3 years now. My parents are very religious (mostly my mom), and my sister even goes to a Christian camp every summer which I think she actually enjoys. In fact, I think she is in a Christian, but is conflicted about her orientation in relation to her beliefs. 

I feel as though that, if she were to come out, my father would be supportive, but my mother would not. My sister was willing to tell her friends that she is gay but not her own brothers who she knows she can fully trust?

I know I made a lot of predictions as to what is actually happening in the situation, but it's been stuck in my head. My sister never leaves her room, is gaining a lot of weight, and has the pressure of her sexuality on her mind. Not to mention that her friends aren't that great.

What do I do?",relationship_advice
My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry her and I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?,"Not sure if this belongs in this sub because it isn't my relationship I'm asking for advice about. If not, apologies. 

Tldr: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend of 6 years to marry him, and I'm the only one who knows the truth about how unfaithful she's been to him. He's completely blinded by love and to him she can do no wrong. I know it might not be my place to say anything but I don't want him to make a huge mistake.

So my good friend ""Aaron"" and his girlfriend ""Mary"" have been together for almost 7 years. They meet in college and are in a very close relationship. Personally I would call them extremely codependent. Neither of them really have any friends aside from each other. She doesn't let him have guy friends. In fact she doesn't let him do a lot of things. He's not allowed to go out past 11, not allowed to drink or smoke, she has to approve of all of his friends, and he's not allowed to be alone with other girls. She's got this guy on a tight leash. 

The reason why they're still together is that Aaron is completely whipped, and to him she can do no wrong. He talks regularly about how amazed he still is that she finds him attractive. (He's a decent looking guy, but she's like super model level good looking) 
They post cutesy couple photos every day (im pretty sure she makes him post them) and to everyone who sees them they appear to be the perfect magical fairytale couple.

Anyway a few weeks ago he told my boyfriend and I that he was planning on proposing to Mary. Of course we congratulated him because he seemed super excited. 

Now here's the issue: a few weeks prior to this, I hung out with a friend of Mary- ""Alison"". Alison told me about a party they went to where Mary got drunk and slept with her ex. After the party they began hooking up regularly, and she had a threesome with him and a friend of his. Aaron has no knowledge of these hookups. 

I told my boyfriend about it because he shares my friendship with both of them, and he believes that we need to say something but I'm not so sure how to even go about that. It will destroy him, ruin their entire relationship and maybe a friendship as well. However I think in the long term he will be unhappy with a marriage where she's so controlling. Not even that, but if she's completely okay with cheating on her long term partner it will be the same once they're married. 

Is telling him the right thing to do?

Edit: to clarify, the cheating has not been going on for 6 years (as far as I'm aware) and the hookups occurred recently.

Edit 2: some of the commenters are calling me a bad friend for not telling him immediately. After giving it some thought and reading the comments, I have decided to tell him as soon as I can, most likely tonight if he's free to hang out. To those saying I'm being a bad friend for waiting: this is a huge deal, and it will greatly affect the future of Aaron, and I want to make sure I break the news in the correct way. This man is blinded by love. He's not going to be expecting this news at all and his whole life is about to change. I'm definitely not going to do nothing, because he deserves much better than this woman, and he deserves to know the truth about what he's getting into if he still decides to marry her. I'm expecting a full blown shit storm, I'm expecting him to be hurt, angry, in disbelief. I don't believe it's wrong that I'm asking for a bit of advice on how to approach this. Should I have told him sooner? Maybe, but what difference would a few weeks make? For all those asking, I'll post an update when I do it.

Edit 3: I've talked to Aaron since I posted this and he is coming over tonight to talk/hang out. My bf and I are going to tell him together because he knows the situation as well. A few of you have suggested I talk to Mary first to give her a chance to come clean. While that's a good idea, I'm not as close to her as I am to Aaron, and I don't see that going over well. I would much rather tell him and leave it to him to decide what to do from there

Edit 4: new information has been received from the third party friend Alison. She has sent me screenshots of texts that do prove Mary has been involved with her ex. They send messages regularly and he has sent her nudes.

Edit 5: lmao I'll just mention that Aaron just got to our house (8:00pm EST) will update later if I can. Thank you all so much for the kind messages and helping me work this hot mess out. Ive been stressing about this all day but I believe I am doing the right thing in telling him.

Edit 6: quick little edit. (11:00 EST) We all talked for a good bit, I told him what I heard from Alison and it went better than expected, but he was still pretty mad and upset. We are all just chilling and drinking now- I'll post the whole story tomorrow. Thanks again for all the replies!",relationship_advice
[UPDATE:] Today i found out my (19M) boyfriend has been cheating on me (18F) with his mother for our entire relationship,"(My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ghhsm/today_i_found_out_my_19m_boyfriend_has_been/?st=JM70CR7V&sh=e5637263) ) 

I have no idea where to start with the events that have occurred within the past 11 hours since i last   posted. I am still shaken up and this is hard to process. 

My bf finally messaged me back a few hours after i asked him to meet up with me. He agreed to meet me at his apartment. I made sure that i was going to talk to his dad before him so he could help me find the correct course of action for my bf. 

Well i met with the father (we will call him X). I was so scared before talking to X that i was shaking. My voice was unsteady and i had tears in my eyes when i walked in. I had no idea where to begin. X looked concerned so he sat us down across from each other. I told X that i believe his son has been sexually abused for 6 years now. Of course, X was taken aback. I started to tell him about what my bf told me. That's when X started to be more and more puzzled. He stopped me while telling the story i knew about my bf and his mother. X told me that there's no way this is completely true. When he says this i start getting confused as well. X tells me that my bfs mother died in a car accident when  he was 8. X never remarried or had a gf. At this point i am dumbfounded and i have no idea what to say. 

X tells me that he didn't think my bfs mother was sexually abusive while she was alive or why my bf would even tell me this. X also tells me that he have no idea who ""mom"" might be on his phone. I take a few minutes to calm down and think before i head over to my bf's apartment.

The drive was only 10ish minutes from X's House to my bf's. I took this time to process what X told me and what i would say to my bf. When i got to the apartment i promptly went inside. I demanded answers immediately. I asked the truth about his mother, the messages i saw, and if they've really been having sex since he was 13. Of course he apologized again and gave me the same story but it made me angry. This is where i lost my cool.

I yelled and told him that X told me that his biological mother had been dead for almost 11 years. I told him i knew there was no way the story he told me was true because his mother passed when he was 8 years old. My bf became silent and looked down. At this point i was crying uncontrollably. I felt so bad for what happened and i wanted to get him therapy. I was willing to forgive him for keeping the secret from me. My bf was silent for a few minutes then finally spoke to me. He told me he made the whole story up. The contact he had as ""mom"" was an ex girlfriend he regularly hooked up with. She was 20 and a bartender in our city. He put her name as mom so i wouldn't get suspicious that he was talking to another woman so often. He didn't think i would find out so he fabricated the whole story up. This way, i wouldn't be mad at him. He told me he figured i would feel sorry for him and stay with him. 

I felt so betrayed when he confessed this. In past few days i went from having a healthy relationship to thinking my bf had been sexually abused by his mother then to find out it was all a lie just because he didn't want me to know he was sleeping with this ex. He tried to justify it further, telling me it was meaningless and he only loved me. I told my bf that i want nothing to do with him and left. He tried to follow and plead with me but i ignored him. I drove home, threw out all everything he gave me, and blocked him (once again.) 

I cannot believe he lied about something so major just to protect himself. I haven't stopped crying  since i left his apartment. I'm so hurt and now i don't know what to do. I no longer want him in my life. I'm considering moving towns so he can't find me. He has gotten online and used a fake number to try and get ahold of me to apologize. I need to clear my head and try to take everything in. I will turn off my phone and computer for a while so he can't try to contact me again. 


[UPDATE:] So my now ex-bf came to my apartment and started banging on the door, begging to be let in so we could talk. At this point i have turned all the lights off. I am being quiet so he will hopefully leave. I know he can see my car out front so it's obvious that i am here still. I want to call the cops but i am not sure there's much they can do. I'm thinking about going back to live with my parents until this blows over with him. I am also considering talking to his ex that he was hooking up with. I got her full name and where she works. I will keep updates as i learn more about my ex-bf.

[UPDATE #2:] I am having a lot of people send me messages so thank you for the kind words! I can't reply to everyone's messages so at the bottom of the comments I added some additional commentary on everyone's suspicions. Please read it to answer any questions if you're still unsure. Please note that there are some personal details i left out in order to keep privacy! (Ex. How his mother died) There's a reason he didn't talk about it.

-FOR THOSE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS, I MADE A  [COMMENT](https://m.imgur.com/a/v1yO5Ue)  ON THIS POST TO HELP CLARIFY SOME DETAILS AND GIVE A FINAL UPDATE-",relationship_advice
Update: I [31/m] caught my gf [32/f] cheating red-handed with her ex.,"Previous post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ay7v9w/i_m31_just_caught_my_girlfriend_now_exf32/

I haven't contacted her since I caught her.  She called and texted me today but I ignored them both.  She said she wanted to come by and get her stuff and drop off my key.  Okay?  Throw away the key and buy new bedsheets.  That's literally all she had here.
She showed up at my house almost immediately after I got off work.  I had the door open anyway, and she tried to just walk in, and I stopped her. 
She said, ""Oh, you can barge in on me but I can't barge in on you?""  I was stunned she had the audacity.  She continued with, ""Ya, you come to my friends (her ex...that answered covered in nothing but sweat and a pair of underwear.) house and night, banging on the door when his kids are trying to sleep. But you don't like it that i'm trying to barge in on you?""
I was stunned, I honestly didn't even know what you say.  I just told her I forgave her then asked her to leave, and she refused, and said, I'm not here for forgiveness.  She tried to push through me again but I didn't budge.  She begged me for 10 minutes of my time.  She said I don't have all the information and there's things she needs to tell me.  I told her I have all the information I need, there's nothing more to discuss, and she continued with trying to convince me that there was something important for me to know.  I told her she gaslighted me and manipulated me for the entire relationship, she denied and continued saying there's things I need to know.
Again, I asked her to just please leave that I had somewhere to be.  Then she just deadlooked me in the eye and said, ""somewhere to be huh? So you already had someone else anyway?""  I said, ""no, actually I've never even considered cheating on you.""  she responded with, ""Ya right, that's bullshit.""
Then went straight back into asking me, ""why wont you talk to me?  Why are you doing this to me?""
I responded, ""you mean standing up for myself?  I don't love you anymore.""
She said, ""Yes you do, you can't just turn it off it's not a switch.""
I told her that the person I loved never existed, and asked her again to please leave.

She said, ""you know what, you're not a fucking victim here not everyone is trying to fuck you over.""
I said, ""You're right, there are good women out there and I'll find one that deserves me one day.""
She responded, ""Not if you keep doing stupid shit like this you wont.""  Then walked off and finally left.

My head is swimming, did I handle this correctly, should I have given her a chance to talk to me?  I just feel like it's pointless, we can't be together, I'd never trust her.  On one hand, I feel like I could've handled it a little better.  I know I told her I didn't love her anymore, and I'm still so heartbroken,  I loved her really deep, and I still do to be honest.  I honestly don't know where to go from here.  I'm starting to feel a little bad for not letting her talk, but I just don't see the point.


Edit: Wow, I love the reddit community.  I got out of bed feeling down and then checked my phone,  the love and support that you've shown immediately put a smile on my face and made me feel like I matter again. You guys have turned around what I felt was going to be a hard day.  I can't explain how appreciative I am of every single one of your kind words of support, it means more to me than you know.  I'm going move forward from this, but now it's going to be easier for me knowing that I have the support of all of you beautiful people!  Thank you so much! I will definitely reply as much as I can throughout the day, as i'm going to go out and treat myself to something fun!

"I (M26) just got cheated on/dumped by girlfriend (F23). Have chance for revenge, should I take it?","Some quick context. My GF of 2 years had to drop out of uni last October due to money issues. I helped her move to my city to start fresh. After a few months of living separately and saving, we moved into an apartment together and she got an awesome job offer. Things were looking great. 

Her new job requires her to attend a 3 month training course on a campus in a different part of the country. She's 2 weeks into this course and she's just told me that she's ending our relationship because she's started fucking another trainee. This means I now have to move out of our apartment because I can't afford to live here by myself (whereas she can). 

So I've lost my girlfriend and my apartment and naturally I'm pretty pissed. However I know that the training course she is on has a strict 'no relationship' policy amongst trainees, and is punishable by exclusion from the course. I'm contemplating sending an email to the company explaining the situation. I don't have any proof but I'm sure if they monitored her she would get caught out soon enough and sent home. 

I don't know whether or not to do it. I feel like she has just ruined my life, and as much as I'd like to walk away from this situation, part of me wants to get some payback. 

What do you guys think? Dick move or karma?

UPDATE: You're all as indecisive as I am.  I'm going day drinking with my Dad and will likely discuss this at length. Will update later with my decision for anyone who gives a shit. (Thanks to those who have left kind words, I appreciate it. The aggressive comments have made me laugh too so cheers.)

UPDATE 2: A lot of you guys asked for an update so here it is. Despite a lot of convincing posts, I'm not going to do it. She needed a lot of support to get to this point (financial, emotional and otherwise) and without it I think she's perfectly capable of fucking up this opportunity by herself. I'm going to keep the apartment, even if it means I have to leave down the line. I want to put her through the stress of finding somewhere new to live whilst out of the city. 

Thanks for all the kind messages (and the edgy ones). A lot of you guys are wise as fuck and gave some good advice. Sorry to everyone that wanted revenge, perfectly ready for you guys to call me boring or a pussy or whatever.

UPDATE: Would it be okay/weird if I [20F] asked out the stranger [24?M] who saved me from being kidnapped out to dinner?,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9c521z/would_it_be_okayweird_if_i_20f_asked_out_the/)

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Woah, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to crawl into a hole after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. I wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""I love that dress! You look really good!"" We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. (For those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how I asked him out). Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me. Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what has happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

My boyfriend is into butt stuff. I am /horrified/ by assholes.,"My(F21) boyfriend(M22) really gets off on having things in his ass, and it's slowly come to full swing over the course of our relationship. I hate assholes. They do nothing for me, i don't want to look at them, touch them, have mine looked at/touched. I don't like thinking they exist. Yeah, i know it's weird; no, it really probably isn't going to change. 
My other issue here is that I'm so proud of him for it. Like, he's come so far with being comfortable with his sexual desires and i am overjoyed seeing him doing so well for himself, especially since we're long distance. 
Occasionally I'll send him nudes if I'm up in the middle of the night because he likes waking up to them, but my other problem is that now I wake up to pictures of him really hard with toys up his ass. 
I don't want this. 
I never wanted this. 
Thinking about putting things in butts makes me want to vomit and i want nothing to do with it. But I'm also in the position of not wanting to tell him because i don't want him to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Please help me. 

Edit: thank you so much for the feedback everyone, you honestly don't know how much i appreciate it, and I'm happy i came here for advice. I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow and give an update when the time comes

Edit 2: I wasn't expecting this to blow up, so thanks to everyone except a few of you. 

@ everyone giving the advice to tell him he's gay(I'm bi and we've talked about it, he's not)/discourage him from doing what sexually pleases him, fuck you guys. I'm talking to him today so I'll update again in a few hours 

The BIG EDIT: I texted him this morning and we talked about it, and everything is O.K. I feel like some of you guys are looking for a really dramatic and satisfying wrap-up but it was kind of not that big of a deal to him. I did make him laugh though because he wasn't expecting a conversation about his asshole first thing in the morning and he wants to see this post so apparently that's happening too. Again, thank you for your help everyone besides the aforementioned people in my last edit. Perhaps in another life I'll like assholes a little more.

My boyfriend has a crush on my best friend.,"Okay, guys, I don't even know where to start this whole day has been a whirlwind. I apologize as this is going to be a long one. Obligatory apology for formatting as I'm on mobile. 

Last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar I was at with my friends. He was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. The first thing he said to me was ""let me know if anyone here touches you, I'm in a fighting mood."" ?! What. I'm just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

A couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. Stupid, I know. We ended up staying all night, I stayed over because I left my house keys in our DDs car and my friend, I'll call her Emilia, left late in the morning. 

In that time, him and Emilia had had ""life chats"" and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. At one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days' makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn't even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. I have struggled with acne for almost ten years. I'm twenty now. He knows I'm insecure about my skin. 

Anyways. After everyone else had gone home, I was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until I finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. I was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, I asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. He hung up and yelled at me saying I was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

I got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. This time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. ""Look at me, *look* at me!"" Then he tells me that he has a crush on Emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who's ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

I can't stress enough how much I have done for this dude. We have been on and off for **THREE** years. I have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn't have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn't have a running vehicle, used my CAA when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. But I apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like Emilia has. 

Earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn't even opened his [message](https://imgur.com/a/zKlRFTU), I didn't even know he had messaged her. I honestly don't even know what to say about it, I'm kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time I've spent taking care of him has been all for not. That he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

Here is the part where I ask you, dear redditors, for advice. What do I do? I've already broken up with him, blocked him on everything (then unblocked to tell him to get off my netflix), me and Emilia will remain friends of course but, how do I cope with the fact that the person I thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? How do I keep myself from resenting her for it? She is one of my favourite people in this world, I know that this is 100% not her fault, I just don't want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. Lastly, what is the best way to move on? Please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

If you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.

Edit: He was not an addict when we started dating, the coke habit he picked up afterwards. I just didn't want to see him choose that path for himself and thought that I could help him, which I know now is beyond me.

Edit 2: Holy smokes. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts. I'm so sorry I can't reply to you all but I promise I am listening and share many of your opinions. I appreciate everything you have to say whether it is tough-love or no-love. 

To clarify some things: I dumped him! I am NOT mad at Emilia, was just looking for advice so that I don't shift blame. We WERE dating when this happened and that is why I went to his house, when we were off we were VLC. Emilia and I became friends last year through work and have lived in different cities the entirety of our friendship which is why they'd never hung out.

Edit 3: Here is my chance to PROFIT. Please send me your pet pictures!!! I need as many smiles as I can get and your sweet fluffy babies will bring me almost as much joy as they do you💗

Edit 4: Okay I promise I'm done editing after this but HOLY. SMOKES. Gilded?! My reddit award cherry has been popped! This is nuts. I never expected this many people to read it, let alone respond or GILD me. Just a final thank you to everyone who's reached out and offered support. You are all beautiful people and have really helped me see the light in this situation.",relationship_advice
"Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in front of everyone?","A bit of background: Me and boyfriend (recently ex boyfriend) definitely had our fair share of issues. He really struggled with insecurities and jealousy issues. The idea of me going to the gym alone was one he struggled with. Additionally certain articles of clothing I wore were also an issue for him (he would get extremely upset seeing other men ""check me out""). He ultimately decided to seek therapy for these issues determined to fix them. After long discussion we decided it would be best for both of us to part ways as he tries to work through his own issues. This break up occurred not even 2 weeks ago, and of course still feels very raw to me. 

I regularly confided in my older brother about these issues throughout my relationship (we are very close). It has been apparent he has discussed some of these issues with his finance. I wasn't upset, I understood it was his finance after all. I felt comfortable that these discussions were between the three of us. 

However this was not the case tonight. Everyone came to our house this evening for a BBQ. This included my parents, all my siblings, and friends of my brother and I. I walked in the door in full gym attire as I had just came from the gym. My brother finances looks at me and loudly announces ""WOW you really are single now! Look at you actually being allowed to  go to the gym again! *insert annoying laugh here*"". The room instantly got silent, everyone looked to me with uncomfortable expressions looking for my reaction. I was so shocked it took me a second to process what she just said in front of everyone. My dad quickly realizing how uncomfortable I was, changed the subject and everyone began talking again. 

I was hurt by this so called ""joke"" but for the sake of the night I decided to let it go thinking that would be the end of it. NOPE. Not even thirty minutes later, everyone is gathered around the table getting food buffet style. She looks at my outfit and announces ""Oooh you wore leggings to the gym? Must be nice to finally be able to wear leggings again without (ex's name) telling you what you can and can't wear"" again followed by her fake laughter. I instantly felt my blood boil (from anger and sheer embarrassment). I politely corrected her saying I was always allowed to wear what I like, despite his feelings of insecurities. 

NO ONE in my family knew these details about our relationship. I had no intention of ever telling them. This was extremely personal to me. I excused myself to the restroom and quickly grabbed my car keys and slid out the backdoor. As soon as I started driving, I started bawling my eyes out. I know this may seem dramatic to some, but I was really effected by this. I was so shocked and angry by how another adult could ever think this type of behavior was ok. I received several texts asking where I was, and saying how I made a ""scene"" by leaving the dinner. I only responded to my parents letting them know I needed a bit of space. I also feel extremely hurt for my ex, as some of his friends were in attendance at this dinner. She has no right to publicly air my ex's very personal issues to his friends or to my family. Am I wrong for abruptly leaving the family dinner and creating an apparent ""scene""?

EDIT: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up! Thank you to everyone who offered me advice, I greatly appreciate it! I decided to post an update for any of you who are interested.

My (21M) girlfriend (21F) is on vacation and spent the night at some random guys house,"Alright I did not want her to go on this trip but she insisted that she wasn't gonna cheat on me or do anything stupid. And I couldn't control her, I could either be angry or be okay with it so I decided to just act chill and be okay with it. She said it was only girls and they were going to Miami for innocent fun. Drinking and dancing and no guys allowed. I believed her but I am needy and I love her so every morning while she was gone, we would FaceTime for a bit, just say good morning and stuff. I would miss her. 

She was out having fun but she'd still FaceTime me every morning and I loved that. I looked forward to seeing her. I FaceTimed her this morning and she kept declining it and I texted her asking her what she was doing that for. She said she just didn't wanna talk because she looked ugly and I was very confused since I don't care about that. So I kept calling and she finally picked up and she was with one of her girl friends eating breakfast in bed with some random Italian looking guy. She tried to purposely hide him from the camera but I'm not dumb. I asked her who that was and she immediately was like ""listen nothing happened, I didn't do anything, so don't yell at me. We met him last night at the club, he's nice and let us spend the night and he slept on his couch, nothing happened so don't worry."" I was pissed off because she was implying that I'd be overreacting if I got mad that she was in bed with another guy but I continued with our morning talk. She's still on her trip and I don't know what to think. Does it seem like she was lying",relationship_advice
My girlfriend cries at night and it breaks my heart. Should i tell her i know that?,"Throwaway account because I feel more comfortable this way.

So, my girlfriend (21) and I (24) have dated for a year before we moved together a few months ago. She likes to sleep by herself sometimes so she moves to the couch and sleeps there. ≈A month ago we were sleeping separately again and when I woke up in the middle of the night because apparently my organism wanted some water, I heard some sobbing from the room where my girlfriend was sleeping. At first my sleepy brain didn't actually recognise those sounds as crying, but after focusing on them for a few minutes it was obvious for me that she was crying. The next day she looked as if nothing happened, we slept togeher and I decided not to talk about it with her. It happened again next week, when I just couldn't sleep and heard her sobbing when she was on the couch.
I figured she cries every night spends on the couch and at this point I don't really know if I should tell her I know about it.
It's worth mentioning that she's depressed and she really doesn't like showing her negative feelings or vulnerabilities and I'm afraid that if I tell her she's going to feel embarrassed or ashamed and won't talk about it again. She sees a therapist as well but I don't think it helps. She's a great person and I really love her, but that thing is killing me and I don't know what to do to make her feel better.

Edit: Well, it blew up and I have to say 2 things. First of all, English isn't my first language and I'm sorry if I sound silly or you didn't understand some parts. Second of all, no, I don't call myself ""organism"". I said that obviously jokingly. I was nervous and wanted to relax a little bit so I added this unfunny note. Stop commenting about it.",relationship_advice
"I [31m] found text messages from my gf [26f] of 3 years to another man including ""I love you"". Should I kick her out?","So this happened a week or two before Christmas. We work opposite schedules so one of us can be at home with our kid at all times. She works weekends (and the occasional week night) at a local children's hospital and I work 9-5 weekdays. 

I had recently grown suspicious of her ""friendship"" with this guy she would bring over for play dates because he also has a young daughter. They were texting a lot and making plans to hang out together more and more frequently. 

One Monday night when she had to work I decided to snoop. I logged into her iMessages on the kids iPad and immediately saw that they were regularly texting. She was not texting me at the time but she was texting him, and very flirtatiously. Kissy faces. Heart emojis. All that. Stuff she used to do with me! I kept my cool and kept watching to see how far this actually went. At first I was in shock and couldn't believe that was actually happening.

By the end of the night I saw it. They exchanged ""I love yous"" and they spoke of each other as their ""missing puzzle piece"" while making future plans to hang out together, alone. I still have all the text screenshots saved.

The next morning I brought it up to her and in my anger told her to move out. She claims that she didn't mean it and she was going to ""break it off"" with him after Christmas but I find that hard to believe. She also claims they didn't sleep together but they had hung out together multiple times before without me so who knows. She even bought tickets for them to go to a hockey game together! Plus I don't know what she's doing at home when I'm at work all week. 

Part of me wants to believe her and let it go because we have a kid together and it was supposedly just ""meaningless words"" but shouldn't she have thought about before she decided to have an emotional affair with another man? She hid it from me so she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong.

The house and bills are in my name because we are not married so she has no legal right to stay here as far as I know (I have consulted with a lawyer already).

Am I blowing this all out of proportion or is forcing her to move out the right thing to do despite how hard it may be?",relationship_advice
Visiting my little brother who is homeless and an addict.,"My little brother is homeless and an addict.  He has been in and out of jail/rehab and on the streets for for a while now.  It appears that he has given up now and has no plans to do anything, but continue using and living on the streets.  It looks like his health is drastically declining.  He has lost 60-100 pounds in the last 6-8 months.  It appears that he is shooting up, I think meth, as he says, though, he was doing heroin, but said he stopped.  

I'm flying out to visit him for his birthday in a couple weeks.  But mostly, I'm flying out because I don't think he'll be around much longer.  I think this will be the last time I see my brother.  

I'm trying to figure out what my time with him should be like.  I know I need to have boundaries as to not be enabling, though I don't think I would be.  I more or less just don't know if I should be putting pressure on him to change or if I should just have it be a time where I'm present with him?  

I want to avoid causing him to feel more shame than he does.  I understand he probably feels very ostracised from family and all of life, really.  I'd like to show him compassion as much as possible, but I also want him to get better.  

I also just kinda feel like I'm waiting for him to die.  

I don't know.  My thoughts are kinda scrambled and I'm not certain what I'm asking really.  I guess just general advice for the situation?  I just don't know what this time is supposed to be like.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,"Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i\_32m\_make\_significantly\_more\_money\_than\_my\_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than_my_new/)

Hello, it's me. Sorry about the new username, I made the first account thinking I would just post & read the replies, so I couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. Didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&#x200B;

It seems folks were split on whether I was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. I think it was probably a little of both. After spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and I probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. It wasn't meant to be condescending, I just want to share my newfound wealth with the people I care about. But, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. In the future, I will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&#x200B;

This is kind of a non-update, but I wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that I will take your advice and ease up a bit. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. A couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday I texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and I quote), ""Yes, of course! Budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&#x200B;

Color me skeptical. But she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

One more thing, to everyone who thinks I just came on here to brag about my wealth: the next time you're rolled into the OR, you'll be glad to have a competent, well-paid anesthesiologist in the room to take care of you. We're the ones monitoring your vitals and keeping you in a controlled state of death while the surgeons operate, so if you've had surgery and didn't wake up with your chest cavity open, thank an anesthesiologist!",relationship_advice
My (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because I accidentally got pregnant,"Edit: Sorry for that glaring typo in the title.

This entire situation blew up so fast in my face that I'm still reeling.

I should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict Asian immigrant parents. It's always been education and academics before love and support. I grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""B"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. Nevertheless, I obeyed their every command. I graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to Brown University on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

Following my college acceptances, I probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. My parents finally had nothing to complain about since I fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an Ivy League school."" All was good for about a month. My parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. I was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

My boyfriend and I have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. My parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but I brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. But after I committed to Brown and they seemed happy enough, I became more lax about hanging out with him and I think they figured it out. 

We started being sexually active in December but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. The only time where I'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to Mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. It would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. Now, I fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. It's our fault completely and I'm not saying otherwise.

Fast-forward to about a week ago. I'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. At that point, I honestly just knew. It was like this weird gut feeling and I freaked the fuck out. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. All positive. I broke down and cried for hours. 

When I got home, I was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. But I wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. I spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. In retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

The very next day, I wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. I get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in Chinese like, ""You're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""I should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" And other completely ridiculous things like, ""Now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

I was begging her to stop but the more I did the angrier she got. She was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. All I could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

It's been three days since that happened. I've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. My mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment I am and how I turned into a prostitute. She also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at Brown and that I will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. My yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. I have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. However, that's not counting the birthday money I've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. Those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. There's about $75,000 in there and I have no idea how I'm going to get it back.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend. His parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and I am so ashamed. They've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice I end up making about the baby. We've both decided that I'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while I'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

I don't know why but I just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. I can't my best friends because I don't want this to spread and I obviously have no familial support. I'm just so lost. What should I even do at this point? 

TL;DR: Strict Asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out I was pregnant. They've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. I fully plan on attending Brown this fall after getting the abortion, but I have no money. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice
(Update) My(23F) sister(25F) and friends(20s) talked about how I'm not good enough for my BF(25M). They don't know I heard.,"

Hey everyone, first of all, I'd like to thank everyone for the messages and comments on my last post, it truly helped me get off the bed and face the day.

I showed my BF the last post bc I just didn't know how I could say it. He was very sad and disappointed but being asexual he has had his fair number of assholes, but he mostly felt angry for me and agreed with the majority of advices that I should confront her. We decided a letter would be the best choice since I actually write a lot of letters and it's not direct confrontation.

I like writing letters for moments(like, letters for when the person is sad, happy, angry, scared, ect) so I do have some techinique but this was, with no doubt, the hardest things I ever wrote. I decided to go for the simple and blunt. Told her I heard what they said about me and while I was willing to work on our relationship, I needed distance from her and this whole situation.

I talked with my landlord(lady?) and she was super sweet and had no problem breaking the lease, I offered to find someone to take up my place but apparently she has someone that could use the room so that's cool

I intended to pack and leave the letter on her bed but she came home early and caught me. I basically said fuck it to myself and told her I heard them saying I wasn't good enough and calling me names.

First she tried to deny, which I wasn't having it, then she tried to justify and say I was overreacting but I just stared at her. Then she finally started to apologize and cry. At that moment I actually thought we might be able to save the relationship but then she started making herself the victim. The main points were

1- I just can't understand how hard it is to be pretty(not even kidding)

2- I don't understand how she feels bc I'm used at not being the best

3-It's not fair I get a gorgeous BF, who is completely out of my league while she's single

4-She feels embarassed when we go out together and she has to tell people that my BF is actually mine, not hers

5-She knows asexuality doesn't exist and we're doing this just for attention.

I just kinda froze, I wish I had said something but I couldn't open my mouth. She then said she was going out to ""recover from our traumatic conversation"" and left. 

I just packed the rest of my things and left the letters on her bed. 

I'm currently at my BF's place but I'm looking for a free room that is not super far from my job.

I also wrote and sent letters to my ""friends"" a and then blocked their social media/contacts. I'm certain they'll find a way to approach me as we work close but I can't give a fuck.

Besides all of that, last friday I had dinner with my parents, I gave them an edited version of what happened(bc I don't wanna talk about my sex life) and that I broke the lease/blocked my friends. They said I shouldn't be angry bc it was true and that the first time they met my BF they thought I was playing a prank. My dad then started saying I was veing selfish by breaking the lease and, I shit you not, betraying my sister trust and that you don't do this with family.

So yeah, I've been ignoring them since this happened, as well as my sister.

Overall, I'm fine, I actually feel more tired than angry or sad


TL;DR: talked with my BF, it went well. Talked with my sister, didn't go well. Moved out. Talked with my parents, they said I'm selfish

My wife's mother tickles our son inappropriately and my wife defends her - help?,"Hi everyone. I am a 35M married to a 27F. 

We have a 2 year old son. Ever since I can remember, my wife's mother has tickled him. Usually in normal places but also in places where it shouldn't be okay to tickle someone. 

I recently read something that women can actually be child molesters too but it's often overlooked because people give them more leeway and ignore all the signs.

And when I thought about it, I realized that exactly described this scenario. If this were her father or my own father then this would definitely not be tolerated ever!

But the fact that it's my mother in law... who is mother to... my wife... makes it complicated.

I recently called me wife out on it for the Nth time and she came back with ""you have a sick mind to think that my mom would ever molest a child - in fact YOURE the deranged one because you're sexualizing it!""

I actually felt guilty because I felt like maybe I was the one viewing it that way and maybe it is my fault for seeing something that's not there and overreacting.

While my son doesn't seem to have a problem with it, I wonder what example that it's setting for him about boundaries and touching. What if he starts tickling other boys or even girls down there because he learned it from her?

What happens if it progresses into more?

Idk what to do and I'm honestly hurt that my wife is trying to gaslight me about my concerns.",relationship_advice

Update on: I'm a female born without a vagina. How do I tell a guy that I'm interested in about it?,"Here is the link to my first post, if you're interested: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

I apologize for the length of this, but I supposed I needed something for me to layout what happened and come to terms with it. So, if just want a plain update, and don't want to read this (which will probably end up being very long): 

I**n short, it went terrible. And frankly, I didn't handle it well.** 

The original plan was to get coffee, see how the date went and go on from there. He told me he had been recently fat-fished (not sure if that is the correct term, but he had previous met up with a girl that was waaaay heavier than what was presented in her dating profile, and it allegedly went poorly). 

He was texting me less and less leading up to the day we planned on meeting, last Wednesday. He texted me Tuesday morning saying that he was sick, and apologized for the lack of communication. I had classes that day and was only able to get back to him later in the evening. I asked him if he was busy because I wanted to call him, see how he was feeling, and figure out what the plan was. I told him that health comes first, and we can always reschedule, but he insisted how badly he wanted to see me. Somehow he convinced me to see him Tuesday, at his place, even though he was sick.

Once I got to his place, he was extremely sweet and nice. We totally hit it off, he complimented me a lot, said I was cute and hugged me, twice, all excitedly like when a puppy see's you when you get home after a long day. He made us coffee, and we talked about life, school, family, hobbies/interests, etc. It was going very well. We got into the discussion of movies/tv shows, and he ended up turning on his TV, and switched to Netflix. I asked him if he watched any anime. Personally, I'm not big on anime but I've seen a few shows because my younger brother is into it. I recommended Full Metal Alchemist to him and we started watching that. He asked if he could sit closer to me, I said yes, and he noticed I was cold, so he turned up the heat and brought out a blanket for us. I had my head resting on his chest with his arm around me, and I joked about how fast his heart was beating. He said that it was probably because he had a cute girl sitting with him. In that moment, I realized I had to tell him about my condition. It took awhile for me to get into that discussion because 1) I just wanted to hold on to that moment for a bit longer and 2) I wanted to tell him, but I couldn't get the words to come out. He looked at me and tried going in for a kiss, but I pulled away. I said that I had to tell him something and asked him to turn off the tv. He obliged. I just froze after that. I literally couldn't get the words to come out in the way I wanted them to or how to begin to talk coherently. Even though I asked for advice in the previous post, I totally went blank in that moment and none of it was implemented effectively. I tried changing the conversation because I felt like I was going to cry but he assured me that I could tell him. I honestly don't remember what I said because I'm pretty sure my brain shut down, but I managed to mumble some sort of god-awful explanation. He asked a few questions, and then said he wasn't sure if he could be in a relationship that doesn't involve sex. He said that we could keep it casual for now and see where things went. 

Even though I originally went in with the worst expectation, I was still hurt by what he said. I felt really let down because he met a lot of the things on my checklist and I thought we connected well. I asked what ""keep it casual"" specifically meant for him, and he said that we could be exclusive, but he didn't want to get too emotionally attached. I guess that was the part that really stung. I told him that I wasn't looking for a definitive answer yet because it was still too early to tell anything, and I wasn't looking for marriage, but if he knew right now, for a fact, that he can't be in a serious relationship with someone that has my condition then I wasn't interested. I know myself too well and honest to god I can't get involved with someone without getting emotionally attached and agreeing to ""see where it went"" would be intentionally setting myself up to get hurt. Plus, I think that was just his way of saying no to me nicely. He politely said that we could both take a few days to think about what we wanted, and he'd let me know. He was just trying to let me down easy, because we both knew what he meant. It was around 8:30pm by the time we got done with that discussion and I said that I should probably leave. He walked me to the elevator, in silence, and as I was about to enter the elevator he asked if I would still be interested in being friend because he enjoyed my company. I said I wasn't sure, and that I'd talk to him later. By the time I got down to the 1st floor and out the building, I had tears down my face and I felt like absolute shit. 

Pretty much every guy I have told about my condition would later go on to say that we could be FWB or something more 'friendly'. I just felt like no one would ever want me for me, and that all I would be good for is some side action. I felt really alone. I felt that the only reason I had ever been in a relationship previously was because I hadn't been diagnosed with my condition when I started dating my ex, and we had already been together for a year when I did find out. I felt like he only stayed with me a year longer was because we had an emotional bond, but even that came to an end when he cheated on me. I'm not THAT insecure but at that time I couldn't think straight. I had just experienced something nice, and it was instantly taken away from me. I haven't had many friends after my ex cheated on me with my best friend and I cut contact with everyone in that circle and making friends at University is difficult if you're a commuter. I ended up calling a guy I know as I walked back to the subway. I don't really consider him a friend anymore because he has told me he has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way back towards him, and he makes constant cheesy statements about me and him despite me telling him not to. I don't want him getting too attached to me, so I keep my distance. But in that moment, I really needed someone, and I didn't have any other option. So I called him, he picked up, I asked if he was busy, and he said he was playing a game with friends and he could call me back later... I didn't want to bother him like that, so I told him it wasn't necessary. So, I did something  very stupid, and called my ex. His gf (the girl he cheated on me with) had him block my number, so it went straight to voicemail. Like any insane person, I left a very pathetic voicemail, sobbing and all. I said I didn't have anyone to talk to and apologized for calling him, but I couldn't think of anyone else to talk to. I didn't mention what happened or anything, just that I needed someone. I stood outside in the cold (its snowing here) for awhile until my whole body felt numb. I gathered myself and thought ""C'mon, what are the fuck are you doing? This is not you. You're better than this."" I promptly got on the subway, went home, got into bed, and went to sleep. 

I woke up the next morning with a fever (that's what I get for getting too close to a guy that's sick) but still had to go to class and attend tutorials. I thought about my reaction a lot, and how poorly I had handled it. Clearly, I have issues I need to work on. I stayed late after the tutorial getting extra help, and after my TA was done helping all the other students, I went to her office and privately asked her if she had any recommendations for someone that I could talk to on campus. She asked me if it had to do with academic stress or something more personal. I said the latter. She pulled out her laptop so quick and got me numbers/emails/addresses for places I could contact on campus. She told me that she understood and that she too was having issues a couple months ago and recommended a clinic she had been to personally. I couldn't stop thanking her. Before I left, I said, ""It's not a big deal or too serious, I guess things could always be worse"" and without skipping a beat, she said ""Yeah, but things could also be a lot better."" I thanked her for her help and left. 

He hasn't texted me in 2 days now. I'll wait a little longer, but I guess I got my answer. I realize I am not ready for dating. For the time being, I should get help.

Its not that I can't handle rejection, but that fact that time and time again, I get guys who are totally into me, and aren't looking for sex right away because they want something more meaningful, but as soon as I mention no sex at all (for now, at least), they turn me down. If they rejected me right from the start, and we didn't get along well, I could handle that perfectly fine. I cant help but think I'm a defective human, and will never find a guy who would appreciate me for me. 

I have yet contact the number my TA gave me.

If you've read this far, thank you. If you have any advice, things I should improve on, better ways to handle situations like this, constructive criticism, or any other comments, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. 

Edit: I woke up to a thousand notifications lol I was not expecting for this post to blow up! Thanks to whoever gilded this. I have no idea what it means or what it does, but thanks! 

I just want to thank each and every one of you guys that took the time out of your day to comment on here. I spent a good chunk of my morning just reading the comments. Your kindness and honesty has really touched my heart. Some comments made me tear up. I didn't know I needed to hear the things I did. Thank you. A lot of people also reached out to me personally and offered to talk to me, after I said that I didn't have many friends to talk to. You guys are one of the nicest people ever. I truly do appreciate it. The internet is one hell of a thing!

It's unrealistic for me to reply to each comment but I'll try my best to get to it over the next couple days. I will read all the comments and message even if I don't get around to responding to them.

 Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you Reddit. ❤️ 

Edit: I'm getting a lot of questions and comments about my conditions and the specifics of it. I'm currently a little busy right now but I'm going to add another edit later today or make another post about it, explaining it better and why my condition wasn't diagnosed when I was born and a little more about my family situation and options for surgery. 

I'm honestly surprised that this is getting so much attention. But I'm also happy that I get to inform and educate others! ",relationship_advice
My (25F) best friend (25F) slept with an old crush at her bachelorette party and acts like nothing happened,"I'm torn between doing ""the right thing"" which would likely ruin a 20 year friendship or closing my eyes and looking the other way. Hear me out. 

Let's call her Jane. Jane and I have been friends and neighbors since we were 5. We went to college together and had a typical ""wild streak"" during those years, filled with lots of debauchery. We never did any drugs, though. That was our hard line in the sand. After graduating, we both got well paying jobs and essentially got our lives together. I am not married and still happily single, but Jane is engaged to be married to a great guy, let's call him Robert. Our families love him and over time, he also became my good friend. They're getting married in a beautiful destination wedding in September. I couldn't be more excited for them and Jane has been planning this event for close to a year. 

This weekend we had her bachelorette party which consisted of going to our country club with 8 other girl friends. The plan was to just swim, tan, BBQ, play volleyball, watch movies, drink cocktails, and reminisce. On Saturday morning, Jane comes to breakfast and tells us that she has a surprise for us. Okay, shouldn't be the other way around? Lol. Anyway, around noon, 6 dudes in swimming attire roll in. We were like, ""um, isn't this supposed to be a girls weekend?"" to which Jane replied, ""yeah but I figured you girls need some company"". We all laughed, however none of us ever even hinted at needing men. Turns out, this was just her cover and ruse to get guys in without making it obvious it was for her. We spent the day by the pool, playing volleyball and drinking. Now, most of the girls there were single so we got a little touchy feely with the guys. To our surprise, at some point towards the evening, I see Jane making out with a dude in the pool. I just brushed it off and went about my business. Another friend Karen walked up to me asking why is [name of guy] here. Initially I didn't know who she was referring to but then it clicked. I knew that dude looked familiar but couldn't put my finger on where from. Turns out, he was Jane's HUGE CRUSH in college. Classic football star, philanderer, handsome and charming guy. We both realized that the whole reason why she had invited these guys over was that she could casually spend time with her old crush. 

At that point I figured the party was taking a turn we weren't comfortable with so I walked up to Jane, pulled her to the side and essentially reminded her that she's getting married next month. She laughed me off, asking me to not ruin her party. I wasn't about to argue with her so I dropped it. They made out the whole night, in front of everyone else. Jane was sitting on his lap, kissing, petting, doing all sorts of inappropriate things. Another girl even tried to say that our party days should be behind us, we're grown ups now, not teenagers fucking in bushes. Nope, nothing could swing Jane. Around 2am, everyone went to the rooms. As expected, Jane and that guy spent the night in the same bedroom and I assume they were not playing board games. This morning, we all had breakfast, then the guys left, we checked out, and came back home. I talked to Jane earlier and she is back into the full wedding prep mode, talking about flowers and menus. 

Me and the girls discussed about whether we should have a serious talk with Jane. We've all seen other friends of ours getting married to the wrong people, being miserable, and getting divorced before they hit their 30s. I don't want this to happen to her. We're pretty much 50/50 on whether we should just forget what happened and never mention it again or have the talk with her. We all saw that she and that guy had some weird chemistry and seemed very comfortable with each other. I'm not sure if that was their first time together since college. I'm thinking that she might still have a thing for that dude but I am not sure how to bring it up with her without sounding harsh. What do we do?

TL;DR: my soon-to-be-married best friend slept with a friend from college and acts like nothing happened",relationship_advice
"My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","I honestly don't know what happened. A couple of days ago, my girlfriend who I lived with left our apartment while I was at work, claimed to her family and mutual friends that I'd been physically abusing her, and blocked me on everything. I have no idea what's going on. There weren't any major problems in our relationship that I could see, and we just had consensual sex last night. The very last time I spoke to her before all of this happened, she was perfectly fine, kissed me goodbye before I went to work, and everything was normal.

Then I got a call from my dad toward the end of the day asking me calmly if I've been hitting my girlfriend. I didn't know what he was talking about, and then she told me.

I rushed home, and she had gotten all of her stuff and is staying either with her family, or a friend of hers. My Facebook account is blowing up, and I have no idea what to do.

None of what is being said is true, and I don't know if someone is just playing a cruel joke on me. A few people even mentioned that the police were called, but I haven't heard anything as of yet.

The last major argument we had was probably in February around Valentine's Day. We were going through some financial trouble, the stress got to us, and we were both getting upset with each other over petty, household things. She was my best friend, the person I could rely on to be there for me, and the person I would be there for always, no matter what. We were definitely planning on getting married. It wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. Her family had basically accepted me into the family. I was close with both her mom and her dad. I only called them both once each -- neither of them answered my calls. I called my, I don't know, ex? just twice. No answer. She blocked me on every social media platform of hers that I know of. I asked a couple of friends, but they are being distant with me -- just one word answers, or ghosting me.

What the fuck is happening here? We'd always been up front and honest with each other, and our communication was stellar.

tl;dr: I guess my girlfriend decided she wasn't happy in the relationship or something, and instead of breaking up with me, she left behind my back completely out of the blue, and claimed to everyone that I've been physically abusing her. I have no idea what's going on.",relationship_advice
My two cents and deep concern about this sub.,"Hey all. Me (M28) and my girlfriend (F23) have been long time lurkers on this sub. We have a happy and fulfilling relationship with trust, love, and passion. We have been through our ups and downs, but our relationship is incredible. 

We were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands Facebook. Also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

Fast forward to the comments. This is where my concern starts. MISERY LOVES COMPANY. PERIOD. The amount of cutting, negative, ""DIVORCE HIM AND MOVE ON, GOHRL HE LYIN"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

All I'm saying is be careful, y'all. Especially the younger people who come here for advice. Relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. I hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. Who's got time for that?

Mods, remove this post if I'm breaking any rules. But maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. For example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

Just my two cents. Sorry about the rant.

"My [28M] parents [60s M/F] are about to meet my girlfriend [26F] and they're going to weird about her weight, what do I do?","I have found what could very likely be the girl of my dreams. 

I could accurately use any cliche in the book to describe this woman. My world went from black and white to color when I met her, she knows me better than I know myself, and I feel complete for the first time. 

We've been dating for two years. We're planning to move in together. 

She's never met my parents, and it's starting to become obvious that I'm putting it off. 

I keep putting it off, because I know my parents won't like her. 

My parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. My girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5'2 and roughly 200 pounds. 

My family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she's infertile, self centered (doesn't care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, I could go on and on. 

First of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. She went to an Ivy League school, graduated with Latin Honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. 

She's unfucking believable. 

She's so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. 

I don't know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother's old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won't happen again) or if they're just generally hostile. 

I've told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how I view her but I still don't know how to handle this. 

My girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we're going to move in together and I don't know what to do about this. 

Usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and I'm not sure how to basically say ""my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways"" without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. 

Should I call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they'll just never meet her? Or tell my girlfriend if something happens she has my blessing to say ""go fuck yourself"" and walk out? Or something else entirely? I'm freaking out about this. 

*tl;dr: My girlfriend is overweight, I don't care at all, she wears it well and is a perfect 10. I've been putting off introducing her to my parents because I know they'll make a huge deal out of it and embarrass her. We're moving in together and I can't put off introducing them. How do I head this off?*

Thanks for the gold!",relationship_advice
Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. Last night she had some friends over after she finished work. I work from home so I only left my office to be formal and say hello and continued working. It was easy to hear the conversations they were having eventhough my office is down the hall. I then heard my girlfriend mention that she would leave me for a taller man.Her friends made a comment on how I was a lot shorter than her ex boyfriend. My gf responded:

""If only he was as tall as [ex] he'd be 10 times better, If I could find someone taller than him, I would.""

I guess I should mention my gf is barely 4'11 in shoes. I'm 5'9. The issue isn't the height, but the fact that she would leave me for something so trivial. I talked to her about it since and said she didn't mean anything by it, just that she always dated taller men. She has since apologized multiple times.

Is this a red flag of any kind of things to come or is it just me over thinking?

UPDATE: I didn't feel the need to make an entire different post for the update so here it is:

I left early in the morning to make sure I wasn't making irrational choices. When I came back she was immideatly apolegetic, but I didn't want any more apologies. I talked to her about how little respect she had for me that she felt the need to make jokes at my expense. She started crying and begging not to break up and feeding me the standard bs people say when they don't want to break up.

To not bore you with the details, I broke it off. I lose nothing at this point. 

I should clarify something from my initial post. I get that people can joke around and it doesn't mean anything, but when I confronted her about she denied it and got very defensive. That's the part that got to me. The fact that she tried to cover it up before apologizing.

I read all the comments and thank you.",relationship_advice
"Update to ""I am 25 and getting married. Dealing with issue around picking my ""Maid of Honor"" for my wedding. Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice""","[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/)

&#x200B;

I am so thankful for all of your comments - I read every single one of them! 

&#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, I realized that it is my wedding. My fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. I organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why I did what I did. I realized that it's a story I've told but didn't talk about with my friends, I thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200B;

The brunch was interesting. What I didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. We met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and I raised the issue once more. The person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""Ms. X"" again raised her objection. She was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. This time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. I told them all why I wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and Ms. X admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* Turns out that she wanted to be MoH and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be MoH/Wedding Planner and this would be for her business. I was a bit... surprised. Ms. X was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. Brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and I didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (I will send her an invite). 

&#x200B;

That meant I had to speak to my brother. As I mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so I swung by his office and texted him that I really needed to talk. He misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. I went into his office and he was immediately worried I was sick, but I told him what had happened and why Ms. X dropped out and that I wanted him to be my ""Man of Honor"". He was totally surprised and confused. He asked if I was sure and that I really shouldn't feel compelled which is when I began crying (I had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant I was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. He said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200B;

We arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the Man of Honor so we are having a BBQ at my parent's place this weekend. My mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. My brother offered a very VERY generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the MoH but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. We're really, really excited. 

&#x200B;

Interesting story: One of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and I were friends at college and lived away for a while. While visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. So there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""Hey, you lanced something somewhere! Glad to meet you again!""

My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"This is a throwaway, my boyfriend also has a reddit account. I am sorry for how long it is but please read this, I need advice. 

Updates at the bottom of the post.

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. There is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. My boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. We were at the friend in question's place, let's call him S. S has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but I just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. He plays guitar and I play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions.

So yesterday when I went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. Not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, I say I should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know I'm home okay. S says I should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, I agree and sit back on the couch. S brings his guitar then asks if I want something else to drink, I tell him I am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that I need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. In the mean time, I start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, I quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. Now I was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and I am 100 percent sure of what I saw. He brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do I ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said I should really head home and l started heading for the door. S grabs my arm and is very insistant I should stay, he keeps telling me I should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that I am really hot and how horny he is. I push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

I don't know what to do from here, I couldn't sleep all night and I keep imagining worse case scenarios. I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, I haven't heard from S yet and I don't know if I can even look him in the eyes. All I know is I am not going to be able to act normally and I am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong. I really need some advice.

Edit: Update actually, Thank you for the comments, the advie was very appreciated. I called my boyfriend and told him everything. He believes me and he was very supportive over the phone but hr is very upset, he says I should have told him right away and that he's coming back to ""beat the shit out of him"" and insists we go to the police. This is basically what I was afraid of, I am pretty sure he's going to go to S's place directly, he is 2 hours away. And I can't stop him because it's not like I can go there myself, but at least he says he is here for me.

Second Edit, another update: Thank you all for the wonderful advice and support. We're going to the police station, I am writing this on our way, I am terrified and it's late, this has been a tough day but my boyfriend has been amazingly supportive although he is very angry. We agreed that we wouldn't contact him directly and bf said he would call his other friends to let them know after we talk to the police. This is going out of proportions and I am honestly shaking while writing this but I hope this is the right choice. I am still scared to ruin someone's life over this and I don't know if anything will be done but you guys were right to open my eyes that he might have done it to someone else or will in the future. My bf is very adament on taking it in his own hands if the police don''t do something so I hope they can and I will make another post when an update is necessary. Thank you again, I would not have done this without the support here.",relationship_advice
I [M 26] am getting married soon. Need advice on keeping stalker[F 25] away,"Hello,

Using throwaway because family knows my username.

&#x200B;

So back in 2017 I had met a girl on Tinder. We texted for two months before we met. We had told each other we weren't looking for serious relationships (which is kinda why I agreed to meet her in the first place - I was not in a frame of mind to get into a relationship.). Hooked up the first time we met. Following day she told me she was in love with me and asked if we could date, to which I said no. 

Long drawn fights, a lot of gaslighting, manipulation, crying followed in the subsequent weeks over texts (which I documented) and calls (which I recorded). She told me she was depressed, suffered child abuse, was sexually assaulted and that's the source of her rage. She started threatening me with suicide. I caved and continued to talk to her on a condition that she remains platonic. We did not meet in person, but she sent me > 50 texts daily and would call every alternate day. I played along, thinking she will lose interest soon but that did not happen. She asked three more times if we could get into a relationship and three times I said no. Of course, the logical inconsistency with her saying she will keep it platonic and asking for a relationship went unnoticed because I was just too chicken, too scared, to say anything, thinking she might hurt herself.

After a while this started to affect me and work started to suffer. I tried to distance myself from her. After about 4 months after meeting her, she asked me to meet her again as a birthday present. I refused. She lashed out at me. I told her the ""friendship"" was not going to work this was and I changed my phone number, deleted all my social media and alerted friends. She then contacted a handful of my friends (who she probably figured out from social media), colleagues and started a smear campaign. She also made suicide threats, but did not receive any detectable response. She then showed up at my workplace, and a colleague sent her back telling her that I have quit. I passed on a message through one of the colleagues she called, saying I want no further contact. She keeps listening to some music I upload  - spends hours at times - which is how I know she hasn't completely forgotten me yet. However, last she tried to contact me directly was over a year ago.  

I subsequently found out I am not the first person she did this to. One of the previous victims even works for the same employer as I! There have been at least 4 guys she has done the same thing to.

\[Clearly I am skipping details, but I don't believe these are important\]

I am a guy in India, so there is no provision for me to complain against her - the law thinks Indian men cannot get stalked and harassed. So legal action is not possible. She lives in the same city.

I met a wonderful person by end of 2018 and we got engaged recently. We are getting married soon. What all precautions should I be taking?

My dad (52M) has been inappropriate with me (18F).,"I live with my mom, dad and a younger sister. My dad is usually home for 5 months during which he has a break before taking up projects the rest of the year. 

 I turned 18 last year, he's been at home for 2 months now. I have a room of my own, my sister chooses to sleep with me at times and sometimes with my parents. I usually sleep without locking my door. About a month and a half ago, my dad enters my room at around 2 am in the morning, waking me up asking for sexual favors. I'm usually a deep sleeper and this woke me right up, was traumatizing - I immediately screamed at him, asking him to go away from my room locking the door in the process. I couldn't sleep the entire night, the morning was only worse - though I never feared going to the table for breakfast, he behaved as though everything was normal. My mom only knows there was an issue back then, but doesn't know the details. 

&#x200B;

I have been locking my door ever since that day. Over the course of 2 months, this has repeated 3 times now - having him knock the door, waking me up. I only opened it the first time, asking him never to do it again nor enter my room. The other times, I only was left wide awake and never did open the door. I never could sleep properly ever since and always check under the door to see who it is.

&#x200B;

Early this morning, my sister had an event to attend to and she woke up early, knocked the door. After confirming it was her (half asleep), I let her in in order for her to take her clothes and leave with mom. My sleep cycles are bad, my health isn't in good shape though I do try my best to keep fit. I fall asleep, without the door locked. I'm woken up by dad - touching me inappropriately, forcing me down and asking me to co-operate. I used to exercise earlier and am quite strong physically so I could forcibly get myself away. I was trembling, my mind unable to process anything - all I could do was to scream at him and lock the door behind him. 

&#x200B;

He crossed a line I was hoping I could prevent and I feel rotten inside. I can't seem to get it out of my head. My dad has always served to be an inspiration for me - I always used to look up to him and this ruins a lot of things for me. I feel helpless. I never got to spend much time with dad and wasn't closer to mom than I was with him because of the time he spent away. I used to look forward to time with him and now I just wish he were gone. 

&#x200B;

Distance never really helped with our relationship with dad. Mom and dad were on the verge of splitting up for the same.  But he means the world to her. No one else including us sisters could ever giver her anything like how she enjoys her time with him. He makes her the happiest and how she treasures him is special. She hasn't been working for quite some time now. The sole source of income is from dad. 

It would be selfish of me to break it to mom. It would break her and I don't wish for that to happen. Dad being the only source of income would mean if I ever broke it to mom and they decided to split - my sister's (13) education would be at a stake and we could never be able to live the way we do. I have friends, cousins I know I can rely on - (though none of them know) but mom's usually at home and fin's comfort only with dad. I find myself cornered, and can't really seem to find hope in anything. I feel broken and devastated. My true sense of inspiration is destroyed. 

Things could probably never be the same again. I just hope there's a way out - one in which neither mom nor my sister would have to face the brunt because of me. I have thought it over, and I don't think it would get better wrt dad until I could do something about it - however selfish it may be.  The only way out is I see is to wait until the end of three more months. I'm halfway there perhaps.

[UPDATE] Boyfriend (26M) reveals himself to be one of the worst people on Earth because I (24F) don't like his favorite film,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/buuxxt/me_24f_and_my_boyfriend_26m_got_into_an_argument/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

[Edit at the bottom: Better timeline] 

[Second edit at bottom: Thank you and some understandings] 

First of all, thank you to all the kind people who commented on my original post. Those who told me to stick to my guns made me feel stronger and had saved me from further years of being totally stepped on. 

Like the original post said, my boyfriend and I got into a heated argument because I, a rape survivor, was incredibly uncomfortable watching A Clockwork Orange with him. 

I had left our apartment for a few days and had some time to think. I've been with him for three years now and it is almost as if this tiny little bomb caused my whole world to blow up. I've realized how many times I've put my own feelings aside for him, how many things I have missed out on because I was busy catering to his feelings.

Yesterday, I went home so we could talk. And needless to say, it didn't go well. He was still furious with me, claiming I never care about him or his interests. I counteracted this by listing almost everything I've done for him. I asked him why he was being like this, he knows what I've been through and has always been so understanding.

Cue the real person that he is coming through. He said something along the lines of ""honestly, I was just going along with it because you seem like you needed support but I don't see the big deal."" Asking me why I couldn't just ""get over it"" because it happened ""so long ago."" (I've been assaulted three times. Once when I was ten, again at 16, and then again last year. But that's besides the point, even if it happened once a thousand years ago, it would still affect a survivor.) 

He then continued to blame me for his aggression, saying he was angry because we haven't had sex in a couple weeks. (I have bad spouts of body hatred due to my PTSD and do not like being touched when I'm in this headspace.) He advised that I maybe try going to therapy twice a week instead of just once and maybe that could help. 

I didn't know what to say or what to do. I was terrified of the man in front of me. All of this over a movie? I was shocked and hurt. So, I left. His name is on the lease so I'm not in any binds with him, thank god. I packed my shit and didn't look back. 

I'm still really shaken up. I've known him for so long and never saw this coming. It was like an immediate switch flipped on in his brain. I didn't know that man who I was talking to and I never want to again.

I'm staying at a friends place for now until I make enough to rent my own. Very thankful for my steady job and even steadier friends.

Just needed to get this off my chest I suppose. I haven't really told my friends the extent of what happened. I don't know why. Maybe I'm embarrassed. I don't know. 

Thank you all for the support. Thank you for reading <3

[EDIT] Someone commented and I now see the timeline seems a little murky. Apologies that I wasn't more specific.

Original fight happened on Tuesday. I left that night and stayed out Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Yesterday morning, I made my original post looking for a little bit of outside advice in this situation and then yesterday late evening is when this big blowout happened. Apologies again for any confusion, I now see how it could've been a little weird because of my wording and lack of specifics!

[EDIT 2] Thank you for the two silver. I'm not sure why I've gotten them? But thank you. Second, I've been thinking about it all day, really stewing on everything and thinking back to the past three years and the weeks leading up to this and I've realized that X wasn't as peaches and cream like I really thought him to be. Yes, he was incredibly supportive and kind to me, especially surrounding my trauma. However, I believe this to be because I never said no to him. Everything I did was to make him happy. These past couple weeks, I have started to say no to him. I really believe he never thought I would do this and it caused a lot of anger for him. The film isn't why we broke up, or why he blew up, the film was simply the ""final straw"" in terms of him tolerating me saying no. 

Truly thank you for all the kind words and support. I really just posted this to vent and surely didn't expect all of this. <3",relationship_advice
My mum threw me through a glass door when I was a child. I have scars all over my face and body from this. I only just found out this is how I got them.,"I went next door for ice-cream and when I came back mum was very angry. I remember standing on the porch waiting to get beaten then lying on the kitchen floor with blood spreading out. I was always told that the wind slammed the door into me. It never made sense on that sheltered porch though. Now I don't know whether to confront my mum with it or not.

We had a very broken relationship when I was a teenager to the point of estrangement then slowly built a relationship through my twenties. Now I'm 37, have 2 kids and what looks from the outside like a ""normal"" relationship with her. 

I'm pretty sure she has undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder so it's possible she will completely deny or has built a different reality of that event. 

I found out because my Dad casually dropped into conversation one day what it was like to watch my mum pick me up and throw me through the door. Random dad.

I am often lost in this world of pain from my past again and have a history of drugs/ alcohol/ eating disorders/ depression. I've worked very hard to get to a stable and content place with myself and finding this out has derailed me somewhat. 

Is it just going to hurt more bringing it up with my mum or relieve the suffering?

Ps I'm in New Zealand so will go to sleep now but will check in in the morning. Thanks for your input and kindness, it feels so good to talk about it as I've been feeling very stuck.",relationship_advice
"my(18m) gf(18f) always initiates sex and then stops just before we start, is it fair of me to ask her not to initiate at all?","she'll usually start making out with me and grinding on me and stuff, and then she'll kind of pull away and stop to do just lie down instead. she's said she knows she initiates it and says she just changes her mind just before we start every time. that's fine, i don't want to pressure her into absolutely anything, but after it happened consecutively for a few days i stopped her and said ""listen, you don't want to do anything and that's fine, but please stop initiating stuff. it's not a nice feeling when it stops just before. that doesn't mean force yourself to do anything, just if you're unsure about doing anything, don't start at all.""

edit: she is not manipulative. our communication is great, whenever there's an issue we just say ""hey, we good? anything we need to talk about??""

also, we do hands stuff, but we're **both** not okay with going down on one another.

and she's said she's okay with sex for those concerned about 'maybe shes not okay with it' etc

edit 2: i'm not really super duper fussed about it. the rest of our relationship is great, i just wanted to know if it seems okay to say something like that. ill talk to her about it sometime if it really becomes a hurdle in the relationship but we're very healthy! it's all great, really :) thank you all for the concern!! love you all! this gained so much traction it's nerve wracking!!!!",relationship_advice
"My longer term boyfriend [M25] told me that I [F22] was not completely satisfying him in bed. He asked for an open relationship and now he has a FWB, but he's upset with me now for recently finding one as well.","My boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years and a couple of months ago he told me he felt like he wasn't completely satisfied in the bedroom. I was pretty hurt by this but I can understand it because my libido has been very low due to the stress of my job. I asked him if he was just interested in trying something new and that's when he proposed the idea of an open relationship. This really hurt my feelings, but I didn't say no because I wanted to please him. I told him okay, but that I didn't want to hear about the sexual exchanges he was about to have. We agreed to keep things to ourselves if we got involved with anyone. 

He has a FWB relationship with a girl he met on an app now. He told me that without going into detail about their relationship and I kind of just acted like she didn't exist until recently. Recently I met up with a guy I used to go to school with and we went out for drinks to catch up. We ended up hooking up that night and since then we've continued having sex. He's introduced me to new things and I really enjoy the sex honestly, it's better than the sex I've been having with my boyfriend. 

I still love my boyfriend but the reaction he gave me upon finding out about my sexual relationship with a guy from college has me kind of upset and angry with him. He asked me if I had been seeing anyone else sexually and I told him yes without giving any details. He **begged** me to tell him what my FWB does to me and how exactly I please my FWB in bed. I told him I wasn't going into detail because that was what we had agreed on. He asked me if the sex was better than our sex. I told him honestly, but without detail, that I enjoyed sex with my FWB more because we had been trying new things.

He basically blew up on me and told me I'm not allowed to have a FWB. I said to him, ""well you have one!"" and he responded to me with ""this isn't about me, this is about you being a slut."" Truly unbelievable. 

What the hell do I do in this kind of situation? Is it just me, or is he being unfair?

EDIT : people seem to be confused here. As I stated in a previous comment, my sex drive was low for a while but after a few months of him being with another woman, it started to pick up again. And every time I wanted to have sex with him, he would push me away because he was ""too tired from already have sex"" (with his fwb) or he would engage but he would half ass it even when i was really into it. 

if you're gonna post a judgmental rude comment about how i'm ""lying"" about my low libido and how I hurt my boyfriend by having sex with someone else, then fuck off. He spent months having sex with another girl and I had no choice but to reach out to someone else for satisfaction. HE STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH ME. EVEN WHEN I WANTED IT.",relationship_advice
My(39m) daughter (16f) came out today and my wife(39f) cannot take it.,"This is very embarrassing to put up on my original account so please excuse me for posting from a new account.

We have been married for 17 years, together since high school. We have three children - a son and two daughters (17m,16f&12f). We all have an amazing relationship and we are super close with our children. 

Next week we are hosting a dinner for a special occasion. Everyone from our families is invited. My son's girlfriend is invited too.

So, yesterday my daughter (16f) wanted to talk to me and my wife privately. She basically told us that she was gay and we were the only people she confessed to. She wanted to invite her girlfriend over for the dinner. I must admit that I felt happy because my daughter chose to confide in us. The fact that she was comfortable talking to us about it made me proud. Somehow it made me feel like a good father. 

I reassured her that it was not something to be ashamed of and she would have our full support. This is when my wife exploded. She yelled at my daughter that she was 16 and she's just confused. She asked her she should date boys first because she can't claim to be gay without going out with boys. She also told her that no one in our families is gay( this isn't true and I'll elaborate on this later) and there was zero possibility of my daughter being one. She told her that she was not allowed to meet this girl and she didn't want freaks in her house. 

I was so angry at this point. My daughter was crying and apologizing for letting us down. I basically told my wife to keep her bigoted views to herself and took my daughter out for some alone time. I just reassured her that I would always support her every decision and be there for her and she could talk to me about anything. After we got home she went straight to bed. 

My wife didn't want to talk and told me that I loved my daughter more than her. She told me that she was the one who supported me through all my struggles and was always there for me. After that she just told me that she'd divorce me if I encouraged freaks. I was so taken aback by her behavior. This was totally out of character for her. 

Now, before painting my wife as homophobic, I think I know where this is coming from. Her brother came out to their family as gay. His parents supported his decision but he ended up taking his life because he was bullied. None of the children kniw about this and it was a very traumatic incident for her family. I asked her if thus was about her brother and she told me that he was nuts and refuses to talk to me.

How do I approach this. I want to be there for my daughter but I want my family. I want my wife to accept my daughter's choices. I feel like she just gave me an ultimatum. How do I make things better?

Edit1: Some of you have asked if this was the first time my wife expressed her views on homosexual people. No. We have friends who are gay and she was totally fine with them. 

Edit2:She loved her brother and was shaken by his death. I'm not privy to the exact details because no one in her family is comfortable discussing that but I know that he took his life because he was bullied. So my wife thinks that my daughter has to endure all this and she's upset. 

Edit3: And no. We are not doing any conversion therapy or anything like that. I will stand by my daughter alone if necessary.

"(Update) My girlfriend(18) wants to get breast implants, but I(18) don't want her to.","Thank you so much for your advice! I took a bunch of it to heart. I went to her told her she looks beautiful and that I like her small boobs. I then told her about the medical side effects, and told her I did not want her to do it. But then told her I would support her decision and would love her even if she had them, and would stand by her. We did some research. She then came back to me an hour later and told me she did not want to get them. She then hugged me and started crying. She told me her friend kept making fun of her for it. She said that she had been bullied about it since she was 16. She then told me she though I was lying about me saying I thought her smaller boobs were hot. She kinda just stood and cried for like 10 minutes. So I guess that ended okay with her letting it out...
We are snuggled up right now watching inception, and I'm really happy she is feeling better.

Thank you everyone for your support and ideas : )

So my GF has really small boobs (almost fully flat chested) and I really like them. But she wants to get implants which I really don't want her to get. Now I don't have anything wrong with body modification, like for example she has lip rings and I don't care. I just don't want her to get implants, but also don't want to be controlling.

After I (36F) told my Dad and Stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories and now I do not know how to move forward with our relationship.,"Long post, but there's kind of a lot to this...

Repressed childhood memories coming back? I have heard of this happening but I honestly never thought I'd experience it and holy shit this has been jarring.

My Dad and stepmom have been together since I was age 3, so 33 years.

My childhood was a disaster zone. I have lost large chunks of time where it is a big blank area. I thought it was maybe because I had to take so much Benedryl as a kid because my allergies were so bad that I didn't remember much. Now I think the memory loss is mostly trauma-related. Dark murky memories would come up but I have had no real timeline of my childhood. My mom was married many (many) times and we moved a lot and she had a baby and then another baby and then two more babies. I can sometimes piece together a home we lived in, or what school I went to when, but it is all a blur. I was both my parents first child and the baby of teenage marriage. There was alcoholism and drug use and chaos. Somethings have always stood out... Like the time a stepdad put a gun to my mom's head. Or, my sister being born. Or, times when we had to move out fast and we were told to start throwing the things we wanted into garbage bags and put them into the car.

My mom and I were very close and I was kind of her copilot through all the crap. Crazy as our life was, I loved the hell out of her and she died 2 years ago from cancer. All in all, I have had a kind of hero through it - my dad.

&#x200B;

About a year ago, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting outside around a backyard fire having drinks and real talk. He said something that surprised me, which was that I had lived with them as a kid for a period of about 4-5 years. This was news to me. I had not remembered living with them for that long at all. In my head, it was maybe 6 months. My dad was hurt I did not remember living with them. During that time, my stepmom apologized for being so mean to me during my childhood. I shrugged it off and joked, ""Well, I guess its water under the bridge since I don't remember."" She said, ""no, I was really mean."" And, I said, ""It's okay. All of it has come around. We are good now.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward to two days ago. Over the weekend, the man I love got down on knees and asked me to marry him. Magical moment and we have been very happy. In fact, it's the first relationship I have ever felt safe in, but it takes work and effort for me to trust. I tell my Dad and stepmom the news and watch the whole thing turn and capsize. My dad makes a comment about how I had to beat my sister to a ring (my sister is their daughter/ my half-sister and is in a serious relationship that is also leading to marriage soon). I am struck. I do not feel competitive with my sister and she and I have always celebrated each other's victories. Then, my stepmom asks about where and when and I tell her it might be a year out and she starts making excuses about how she will not be able to go, not willing to go, but tells my dad he can go. I hear this and know my dad will not ever take a trip without her and start to panic that he will not come to my wedding. The comments pile and mount, one on top of the other, until my whole body is trembling. Although I have been sober for over a year suddenly I want nothing more than to drink. But, I do not drink and say everything is ""fine"" when asked and try to leave on a good note to make sense of my feelings in private.

&#x200B;

Something that needs to be explained is that there has always been a strain with stepmom and me. I try hard to do things right, but I am scared of her and always have been. As an adult woman, she still scares me. She is incredibly controlling, powerful, dominating and it is hard. My tactic in avoiding being a target of her passive-aggressive behavior and anger is just to be super nice. Nice all the time. Smile. Swallow. Repeat.

&#x200B;

When I came home from the engagement announcement, it was like the flood gates opened.

One memory cascades into another and another and another.

Suddenly I can recall being 7 and 10 and 12 and all the fear I had as a child in their home.

I remember how much she hated me. The name-calling. The scapegoating.

I remember sucking back tears and being told not to cry at all. I remember hearing all the time ""You're fine.""

I remember the secrets I had to keep about how mean she was. I remember walking down the hallway in our home and being pushed into another room while my dad watched TV in the living room and her whisper-screaming that I was a brat and a terrible child and was ruining her marriage and being told to say nothing to my dad.

I remembered she controlled my sleep habits. I have always slept on my stomach but she required that I slept on my side to face my little sister at night and would come into the room in the middle of the night and catch me on my stomach and wake me up to yell at me and tell me to go back on my side.

She controlled the relationship I had with my dad. We could not do anything she was not a part of, did not supervise, or control.

I remember being cornered again and again. I was targeted and she was after me and it was relentless.

I remember her sisters telling me how sorry they were and that is was not okay for me to be treated this way.

She was a relentless bully.

I remember my sister who is 7 years younger, always trying to protect me and shield me from her mom.

I remember being taunted and teased and made fun of.

I remember one time she yelled at me out front of our house and I got so scared I peed my pants and had to run inside and change.

I remember our neighbors saying that I was safe in their home and if I ever made a mistake in their house they would not tell my stepmom.

I remember when I left my dad and stepmom's house to move back with my mom that they took down all my photos from the walls and told me they would be fostering or adopting a kid to fill my place.

When I moved back with my mom life changed and was chaotic in the way it was with my mom so I think I just forgot all of this stuff and kept going.

But with this sudden flash of remembering everything now, there is just anger. Layers and layers of anger. Anger that my dad did not stand up for me. Anger about what they knew, but I did not. A huge sense of abandonment. What the hell is this? How can I have forgotten all of this? How does it just sweep from view?

&#x200B;

In my head, I rage at her and the main thing I say is, **""Guess what? Now I remember.""**

&#x200B;

I sent them a text. A sheepish way to confront it, but for once I stood up for myself. It was very hard and my whole body quaked and trembled. They did not respond.

&#x200B;

The thing is... they have been trying in the past few years. They moved to my state. They want a relationship with me. She did apologize back in the yard that day. I know my dad loves me and tried in his own way to protect me. I don't think I will get any sense of accountability from them. But, now it's like this mystery has unlocked inside me. I always felt unsafe around her. I never felt like even when she has been nice to me as an adult like I could trust her. Now I know why.

&#x200B;

I think I am about to lose this last remaining chunk of parents I had. My mom is gone and I have continued to work through all the things that happened with her and will head back to therapy to deal with the rest...

&#x200B;

My sister asked what I want to come of all of this. Why put it all towards them? What kind of battle am I setting out to wage? And, I really don't know. I didn't see this coming and I am at a loss. I feel guilty for bringing this up. Like, I am going to wreck the family. But I am also furious. I want them to have to hear it all from me. I want to ask my dad what he did and did not know. I want her confession. I feel like I can already hear my dad telling me not to be so dramatic, and yet, I feel like I will not be able to stuff this one back in.

&#x200B;

How can I rehash something that I only now remember? Is it worth it to even try or do I just salvage a fake relationship for the sake of having one?

I feel bad about feeling sorry for myself. Is there anything that will come from holding them accountable or am I just headed down a path of anger and victimhood?  I wonder if we can even have a relationship from here...

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: I recently told my dad and stepmom I was getting engaged. My dad brought up my sister's likely engagement immediately and completely derailed my news. My stepmom said she wouldn't be coming to my wedding. It brought up years of bullying from my stepmom and neglect from my dad that I had forgotten all about. Now I do not know if I can or want to have a relationship with them and feel insanely guilty for even bringing it up.**

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: Wow. This went... 

I figured this would be my own private story/rant for a few eyes in a corner of Reddit. I did not expect this response. I've been battling with wanting to take it down now. My fiance has encouraged me not to. I've been panicking that my parents will see this. I do not want to hurt them. There is no part of me that wants that. Even in anger. I just want them to know and be honest, without downplaying what it actually was. Not sure that will happen. Pretty unlikely, but its a want. As for what to do about it. I will head off to EMDR and have a handful of referrals for Monday. I will take the ""Damaged Old Person's"" advice (thank you) and move slowly here and get help and not go scorched earth just yet. 

Thanks for the help, encouragement, and congrats. 

As for my partner, which a few posts have asked about... I think he has been a huge reason this is coming out. I think the security of our home and relationship, plus lack of booze as a coping strategy, has meant that now there is the opportunity to actually feel things? I dunno. New territory. He has been hugely supportive in all areas of my life. He is sober, too. A processor. A thoughtful person and we have sat and read some of the responses together and appreciated the insights and conversation. 

As for those questioning validity of my memories, or repressed childhood stuff? New territory also. Like I said at the top, I had heard of this but didn't know it was an actual thing till I was in it. I can only speak to my experience right now as it is occurring and it's been like a download of fresh information complete with recalling my home, surroundings, time of day, where I stood, where others stood, facial expressions, tone, who was there, what was said... So, no my brain didn't just fabricate a false set of memories. I feel the truth of all of these things in my core. This stuff was in me and there is not a question of its reality. The blanks have just been filled in. It feels like a very unfortunate Aha moment. 

Thanks for all of those who have shared their own personal stories of hardship and pain... Man, some of us have walked some really tough roads. I'm sorry for you all, too. Someone shared a link to an article about how isolating abuse is. It's true. Makes me feel crazy. There is a strange solace in knowing others are out there powering through their own pain, too.

Girlfriend of 3 years just came out as asexual,"My girlfriend that I live with and have been with for 3 years just came out to me as asexual. She told me how she has never enjoyed any sex we have and isn't sexually attracted to anyone. I don't know what to do or how to feel except for lost.

"New boyfriend has a micropenis, need some advice","I've [19F] been seeing this guy, Michael [19M], for a few months now and I found out at the weekend he has a micropenis. He told me early on he had a small dick and so we took things slowly. I saw it for the first time on Saturday and it's about 2-2.5"" long. He was really uncomfortable so I only saw and touched it for a minute until he put his boxers back on. He cried after that and I didn't know what to say so I just hugged him and then we went to sleep together.

I really like him as a person and want to stay with him and help him with his insecurities but I've never dealt with something like this before. What can I say or do to him that will help his confidence without seeming to emasculate him?

EDIT 1: He's 2.5"" erect.

EDIT 2: I'm going to bed now so I'll reply in the morning and then talk to my boyfriend about how we can deal with his insecurity together.

EDIT 3: WOW. I wasn't expecting this would blow up this big. Thank you for all your replies and messages and I'm sorry I can't reply to them all. I've thought about everything that's been said here and I'm going to talk with him tonight and tell him how I feel about him and I'm going to show him I'm fine with what he's got, and I'll show him this thread if it will help.",relationship_advice
[F23] Found out that my [M29] boyfriend only settled for me and is not really attracted to me.,"Saw his text messages open and I did pry and when I catched a glimpse of ""break up with her"" (his friend wrote that), I couldn't help but read the entire conversation.

My boyfriend, who is 29, and has been with me for a year, is my first relationship and I'm his first as well. The difference between us, he's been looking for a girlfriend all through his 20s, while I wasn't too bothered/didn't care for guys much. (Busy with college, not much interest, not much need). 

He literally wrote to his friend that he trapped in the relationship. That he wishes he could just hook up and flirt with other girls but he also wrote he always gets rejected and has no chance.

Then he wrote how he would like to be with ""hot girls"" or even just date a hot girl and how he feels like he settled for an average girl.

I am insanely mad.

Honestly, being realistic, I'm a bit above average (My face is about 70th percentile realistically speaking and my body is quite fit/skinny), whereas, as sexy as I find him, is a bit unconventional looking/overweight. Probably average guy by US standards, but he is, (Not in my eyes!), not someone who should complain.

Although, I do believe everyone has the right to be with who they are attracted to. I like chunky guys, others do not. So I don't get why he is with me when I'm not attractive to him and I'm just straight up disappointed.

Besides, his need for hook ups - I don't get it. I'm more enthusiastic about sex than he is, I initiate it, and I would have it more often if he were willing to. 

What made me lose my sh*t is that he thinks he only ""settled"" for me.

I get the impression he's only with me so he won't die alone.

[UPDATE - WE BROKE UP] I [21f] got blackout drunk and told my friends [21f 22f 22f] that my boyfriend's [25m] jacked off to their instagram pics,"Long story short, I broke up with Pete. But if you want the details… I'd been feeling kind of insecure about his loyalty to me for a while, the Instagram thing from my last post was just the tip of the iceberg. 

&#x200B;

Then, shortly after Christmas, i got a text from Bridget, a friend from college, we're in the same program, we have a lot of classes together and study together for our exams. We're not super close friends outside of studying, we have different interests and groups of friends, but we still spend a lot of time together doing homework and studying.

&#x200B;

She basically said that she had something that was weighing on her. She hadn't wanted to tell me before exams, because she knew I was stressed and just trying to make it through finals week… Then she didn't tell me before Christmas, because she didn't want to ruin my holidays, but she felt like she had to say something now. i asked her what it was, and she told me that Pete had been dm-ing her and trying to hit on her, and she hadn't answered and he just escalated, getting mad at her for being online but not answering, then she blocked him. She said nothing went on, she was disgusted by how he'd hit her up when he was in a relationship with me. 

&#x200B;

she sent me screenshots so I know she's for real. Anyway, i was taken aback when she first told me, but the more I think about it, the less I am surprised. I was glad she waited till after exams to tell me, this week has been messy emotionally and I know it would have hurt me academically if I was going through all this during finals week.

&#x200B;

So yeah, I'm not feeling the best right now, i feel pretty damn hurt and used, but i guess the silver lining is that I'll be going into my next semester drama free, and 190 pounds lighter.

&#x200B;

My friends, that I mentioned in my last post, have been very sweet and supportive and I feel so very lucky to have them in my life right now.

Finally stood up to abusive husband,"Throwaway account as my sister in law lives on reddit. Me 30F finally got a back bone and stood up to my 32M husband. Long story so bare with me please.

We've been together for 6 years, married for 2. Everything was fine for the first 3 years. We met at work where I was an an intern, he was a manager. He was so sweet and really supportive of my ambitions and goals as I was of his and we clicked right away. We began dating and as time went on, I started climbing the ladder at my job and on our third year together, I was offered a managing director position....that's when everything went south.

When I was offered the position. I was over the moon, having been an intern on close to nothing , climbing my way up to a position where I'd earn more than enough money to look after both him and I and our future meant so much to me. When I told him, I thought he would be ecstatic especially as he has proposed to me a month prior and I had said yes, it was a great way to earn more money for the wedding and a house.

His responses was lacklustre and he said oh okay, I'll have to think about how I feel about this, turned around and walked out the door and left me for over a week. Wouldn't respond to my messages or calls. I was beyond sick and worried, I thought something had happened to him. He finally came back, over a week later (hadn't shown up at work either) strolls in like nothing happened and says, If you take this job, I'm leaving you. I was shocked and tried to talk about it about it but he said his feelings were final.

Like an idiot, I declined the job because I didn't want to lose him. He once again become sweet again and even though I wasn't earning as much, we were still together. A few months down the track and he starts being critical of my appearance and mental state. He says I've put on weight and should be focused on doing more around the house and working out and he isn't happy with our ""average"" sex life. This throws me for a 6 but I oblige and start working 9-5, getting up at 6 to go to the gym to lose the 10 pounds I had put on off , cleaning the house before I went to work, coming home and cooking every night and then trying to get more adventurous and sexy for him to spice things up.

I'm exhausted by this, meanwhile he goes to work 4 days a week, does no cleaning, plays video games and criticises every meal I cook. I really start losing self esteem at this point and start feeling depressed. He takes it upon himself to talk to my boss behind my back and then I end up having a meeting where my boss says, I think you're putting too much stress on yourself and we'd like you to take some time off. I was stressed and exhausted but work was the only place where I could escape. Even though it felt like shit, I decided to take some time off. While I was having time off my husband manipulated my work and kept telling me that I'm not of Sound mind, that I'm hopeless, that I'm a wreck and should quit my job. I told him no but he barraged me 24/7 and told me that there'd be no wedding.....we had already paid for 75% of it and some of that was a gift from my parents, I was scared of letting them down so in the end I relented.


Well we got married, I thought I could be happy but I was the shell of a woman I once was. Jobless, in a constant state of fear of what else he'd say was wrong with me. He took my phone, limited my internet time, isolated me and made me believe I could only depend on him and that I wasn't worth anything.

The last year has been hell, all I've wanted to do is sleep my life away, although I would t dare in fear of his retaliation, instead I spent my day cleaning and cooking, doing everything he wanted and yet he'd tell me I was ugly and stupid and would just demand sex because the least I could do was get him off.

I felt like a used puppet purely there to satisfy him and not be a full person. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant, what should've been the happiest moment of my life, scared me to death. Some of you may judge me for this but it shook me to the core. I thought about this for a few days , didn't tell him but decided to secretly abort. I was devastated, I want to be a mom but I couldn't imagine subjecting a child to this life. I was numb for a while, I just continued on with everything until a few days ago. 

It hit me like a train, he was so abusive in such a manipulative way. I had given up so much of me to make him happy, I had aborted a child because deep down inside, I knew he is a piece of shit.

I found my car keys that he had hidden and my phone. I found a divorce lawyer, called up my old boss, I went to work, I marched in and said to my boss that I'd like my job back. He asked how my husband would feel about it and I said, I don't care, I know I'm good at what I do and I need the money to leave him. My boss clapped his hands and said welcome back and that the whole team would support me coming back into the work force.

My husband obviously had gotten home by this point and noticed my phone and car was missing, started blowing it up, sending me disgusting messages and telling me to get home now. 

I went home. I walked in, he started yelling and telling me that I've abused his trust by stealing ""my property"" without running it by him, that I should be ashamed. I told him that he can get fucked, we're over, I'm leaving him and he'll be hearing from my lawyer. He immediately started crying hysterically and begged me to stay, that we should work things out , I told him that all of these years I thought it was me who was lacking, but thanked him because it was because of that lie that he kept telling me that made me realise, I'm not lacking, I'm an educated, smart, intelligent person, I said but you knew that already, instead of celebrating me, you became insecure and tried to diminish who I was to make yourself feel better. I told him he was right to feel that way, I am better than him and that you can't polish a fucking turd and walked out, blocked him on all social media, notified all of our friends and family and I've never felt better. 

My question is, should I get someone to collect my things from our house or should I just leave them to avoid having to deal with him?


I'm really looking forward to 2019!

"I (38M) Irishman recently found out I have a Brazilian daughter (19F) I knew nothing about because her mother never told me. DNA proved she is mine, but there is a serious language barrier.","19 years ago I met a Brazilian girl who was friends with my Brazilian buddy who worked and lived in Ireland. She came over to Ireland to study and joined our group of friends, we grew close and to put it bluntly we had sex many times. She couldn't stick Ireland's climate though and found the culture too different and went back to Brazil, she wanted me to apply and move with her back to Brazil. but I was in Brazil before with my buddy in the late 90's, lovely country, but the climate and culture I found too alien, just like she viewed Ireland as too alien. She eventually came to understand and all that shite, we broke up and we went our seperate ways. Sadly never heard from her after that. I moved on. 

Fastforward to half a year ago I'm at home after long day at work, doorbell rings, I answer the door and there she is again, this time with a young woman beside her. She explains that the girl is my daughter. I instantly believe it to be a real possibility, the girls age matches up to when we were together, she is quite fair and has similiar green eyes to me, and me and her mother did not have protected sex. I invite them in to ask all the standard questions. The girl really started to get emotional and cried and got angry at her mother and then looked at me crying asking in broken English was I really her Papa? I said I don't know, but we can do a DNA test and find out which her mother translated to her.  We did the DNA test as fast as possible due to the fact they aren't EU citizens so only had a certain amount of time here and weren't here on work visas. Did the DNA test and yup, it turns out i'm her papa. I'm overjoyed, I never had kids in the 19 years since, always felt bad that I was a 38 guy without a family, as I've never been good at staying in long term relationships. I am quite pissed at her mother, her explanation was that I wouldn't move with her to Brazil so I was no longer relevant to her, pregnant or not, the only reason she brought our girl to finally meet me is because my daughter kept begging to know who her father and she decided once my daughter was an adult she would bring her over to meet her father. This is warped and fucked, but what matters now is my daughter and not her mother. 

&#x200B;

Anyway now that the backstory in out of the way. My daughter is getting Irish citizenship as I am her father and am Irish which allows her to. Her mother has gone back to Brazil. She is living with me now for the time being and wants to get to know me better, she is very affectionate and we get along amazingly she is into many of the same movies, genres as I am which allows us to connect despite the language barrier. I will never get used to being called ''Papa'' though as in Ireland we call our parents, Da, daddy or dad. She is going to start learning English via tutor. She finds the language very difficult at the moment and I have been trying to personally help her learn it as best I can too, but it can be frustrating when trying to communicate with her.  I am crap at languages and can only understand a few key Portugese words. She has quickly filled a hole In my life, is a joy and I feel like I have a lot to life for.

&#x200B;

tldr Asked an old friend to stop being so handsy with my boyfriend, she took it the wrong way and told a common friend I got no business telling her what to do since I owe her so much

&#x200B;

My boyfriend is having sex with her.

A friend convinced some other friends to send me prints of texts between themselves and either my BF or ""best friend"".

They are pretty clear.

I confronted my BF, he looked lost, said he loves me and it was just sex. He says ""Jessie""kept throwing herself at him, teasing him, and he said he didn't like her but I still wanted to hang.

He said he just had sex with her to see if she would move on and leave him alone, and that it only happened a couple of times. Says he wont do it anymore, he doesn't even like her, he loves me, asking me to please forgive him.

From the texts, once I finally made it through them all, I think that Jessie went to the party (where me and BF met) cause she wanted to hook up with him. She had it bad for him, but he didn't feel the same way. She was trying to get him to break up with me, and then to get me to break up with him.

It worked. As of yesterday he is a single man.

In some of those texts, they are talking about some of the hook ups. I feel like throwing up.

I blocked him, cause he was still trying to get in touch.

I ghosted her. But she just sent me a message saying she just heard what happened and ""you know this was probably for the best right?"" and I feel like fucking screaming.

I don't know if this is an update or just me venting.

Thanks for listening either way.

&#x200B;

EDIT

I don't wanna sound melodramatic or sappy or anything, but you all brought me to tears.

We keep hearing about how it is insanity to rely on the internet for personal connections, but I just lost a boyfriend, a best friend, and a whole group of friends.. and instead of feeling alone, I am more and more feeling like ""fuck yeah that was the right thing to do, I will be ok"".  It still hurts. But not as much as it would had I really been alone.

I can't even begin to thank this sub.

I really don't know what to say.

Even on my previous posts that didn't get as many responses, it was some of the comments there that made me approach the cheating thing knowing I had to break up and move on. So it changed my life in this moment. And considering I will be doing a lot of soul searching on toxic relationships, this probably changed my life for good.

So thank you all so much for reaching out to a stranger. This community is so precious!

And I got a gold, I don't even know what to say! Thank you so much! I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I don't even know how much a gold costs, and this is an alt account, so it wont really be used. Is there any way I can return it to the sender? 

Some of you are asking for an update. I might in a while, if there is something new to tell. Right now it's just more of the same.

I don't think I will be able to answer all the comments, but I am trying to at least answer the ones with questions!

Thank you!!",relationship_advice
Update. Caught my wife cheating. What about her kids.,"TL;DR I informed the ex that we would divorce and made arrangements for visitation.

Sorry this update might be jumbled I originally updated in the wrong sub. This is the umpteenth time I have written this out, each time it's shorter. I not sure how to cross post so I am retyping, bear with me. Last week was a busy week with daughter grad., moving her home, kids sports starting, lawyer, and the first face to face with wife. 

Got home Sunday, put daughter's stuff from apt. In garage. I get a call early evening from 14 yr. old. ""Dad what's going on. No one is talking to us. Mom and grandma are crying grandpa's yelling. Is this because of what I told you?"" I assured him that his mom made a bad mistake, that he had nothing to do with this mess. He asked if I was packing up there stuff because he saw the Uhaul in the driveway. I explained what happened and that all their stuff was remain there.

Monday and Wed. were sports nights. Family sits in bleachers while I stand behind home plate backstop. My usual spot since I don't see eye to eye with FIL. On the way across the field the oldest stops his warm up and rubs over to me. We hug and talk a few minutes then send him back. As I get my spot I have a 10 year old crash into me at full speed. I bend down hug and kiss him all over as he is squirming away. My FIL asks if we could talk. We step away from earshot. He apologizes for the way he has treated me in the past and that he was wrong. Well a little late but I accepted and said I knew that it was hard thing for him to do. He invited me to sit with them, I declined. He asked if I wanted to talk to wife. I said Thursday would be better, do we set tinne and place.

Tuesday comes meet with lawyer. I told him the whole story, he knew from his partner but wanted to hear from me. He asked what I wanted to do. I wanted to stay with the boys then stay married. The boys were most important.  He stated in his experience that the marriage would be a charade and not good for the boys. We could work out a visitation if wife is welling. As far as support he said I could do what I wanted for the boys. Not to give her anything for me to control. The prenup was solid, she violated conditions, no support. He cautioned though that judges around the country have in some instances ordered child support in my case due to being in their lives so long. He did not think our judges have ruled that way in tgge past but you never know. He was sure her attorney would seek support. He suggested that we try to agree on everything we could before court, the the judge would look favorably on us.

Before leaving he told me that every Monday morning the partners meet to discuss new and on going cases. My previous attorney started out describing everything. Each partner has a specialty. Estate Planning/Elder Law, Criminal, Liability, Family. Later in tgge pm the criminal lawyer meets up with my attorney. After the meeting he called a contact in the prosecutors office. The $15000 did not seem right. How do folks in the middle class have 15000 in cash laying around. Turns out ex did not abandon them he was in jail. He was released 3 yrs. ago, when Feds were releasing nonviolent criminals to ease overcrowding, etc. He was sure the police would be interested if he was back and practicing his profession again. But he did not have any other info but the jail time.

Thursday I meet with with and FIL. I asked if they minded if I recorded so there would be no misinterpretation latter. They agreed. Before we started wife wanted to talk privately.  FIL moved to another room. Wife started to apologize. I cut her off. I said before you say anything know that I know a lot more than you think. I asked how long the sex, she said the one time. I told her the video shows that is not true. I played a clip of her dusting the TV. She never saw the camera. I know it was only a few days but she was going to lie so I was too. She thought it was part of the video game. It's not big but it is obvious on top of tv. She admitted since March almost right away! I told her no more lies! I told her of the family secret, that he was in jail not running away. She admitted to this also. I asked how long in contact, since Feb. I asked if she met up anytime before him appearing she said no. I then told her he had been out for 3 years.  The look on her face told me she did not know.

We get FIL back in. Turn on recorder. I asked if she had a lawyer? No. Told her to get one because a divorce will happen. They both asked if something along reconciliation could take place, I said no. I said I wanted the boys, she could live with ex. I told her when speaking privately that ex tried to sell me the boys. I repeated for FIL. We settled on the boys could see me anytime within reason, she would not keep me from them. I said I would provide at my choosing. She would get no support. I did not want her getting the boys to ask me for things, they would be honest if I asked.

There you have it. One last thing, redditors the wife and I are avid readers of this site. We have our favorite subs. We would read and share, it was a thing we did together. She has read my post as she figured it out and she read every reply you made. She stated you ""savaged"" her. You said many things I only wish I could have because I did feel it. For that I thank you.",relationship_advice
I snooped on my brother and found something horrifying,"I just found something pretty disturbing, and I'm not sure what really to do next.

My brother is usually a super private person and doesn't hand out his phone to anyone. We're currently on a family vacation overseas and he is the only one with a working data plan, so we've been using is phone quite a bit. His open web tab was on a popular fiction website, and I saw his logged in username before he swapped tabs to a new one.

I frequent the site too, and when back in the airbnb, went to check his profile to see if he too ran in the same fandoms as me. I must admit that this situation is entirely my fault as I snooped. I know I shouldn't have, but I was so curious. To my surprise, he had a few published works, but when I opened one, I almost puked - his latest story was of a brother violently raping his sister in graphic detail, who had the same first name and general description as me, in a setting I recognised as my parent's house. He insulted my eldest sibling and also my parents in horrible ways too. I won't go into further detail but suffice to say it was the single most horrifying thing I've ever read. Ever.

Now I'm in the bathroom of this airbnb typing this and I'm not sure how I'm going to go out and face my family. Should I just ignore this? Is this normal and am I overreacting? I mean, everyone has their kinks and my brother has never, ever acted inappropriately towards me or anyone in my family in real life. Please tell me this is so.

Urgh. Moral of the story, don't snoop, never ends well.

Edit: I am 19F and my brother is 23M.

**Update**: Thank you to those who replied, I still have no idea what I'm going to do. I really do get that it is fiction, and I completely understand that part of the appeal is to push characters to extremes because it would never happen in real life. It would not have disturbed me at all if the people involved were literally any other fictional character, emphasis on the fictional. All I expected when I searched his profile was to find a list of his favorite fics and thought we could discuss any shared fandoms, and I know I shouldn't have gone looking. Didn't expect him to be an author, much less this. Sorry for the long para, it's late at night and I can't bring myself to sleep in the same room as my brothers, might just crash on the couch where I am at now. Also I'm planning to beg off tomorrow's planned tour, will catch up on sleep then.

**Next morning update**: The fam is out for the day, managed to stay back at the Airbnb & the wifi. There has been a split of opinions down below and there are many who think that the writings are just writings, and private. I think I will give him the benefit of the doubt this time. I don't think I have the stomach to upset everything if so. I'll be back out of the house for college soon, so there will be distance.

"General advice-When you mess up and are apologizing, don't put yourself down","Not because you're being too hard on yourself. Because it's manipulative. 

When you are apologizing to your partner for hurting them, don't turn around and say, ""I'm such a POS and I hate myself for doing it"". Because of that person cares about you, you know they'll just end up comforting you. So why did this moment of you accepting responsibility and apologizing turn into you being comforted? 

Apologizing is for your partner. Not you. If you're feeling low and need validation, do that after the apology and do it in a ""this is how I'm feeling"" way. ",relationship_advice
Update: (Not sure if I should break up) It's over,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/afjkus/not_sure_if_i_should_break_up/

I met with Jake a day later.  I wanted extra time to think.  He initially acted really lovey dovey when we met up and told me that Timmy was making me a giant ""welcome home"" sign for when I came back.  I said we needed to talk first.

I basically had written down an estimated numbers of hours I was providing active care for Timmy in the past few months, versus him.  Then how many hours of care he was predicting we each provide, which was 4 of his hours compared to 50 of mine.  I said that I hadn't had time to persue hobbies, go to the gym, etc in the last few months.  And also that we hadn't done anything as a couple.  I said for me to come back, he had to change all that.

He answered with his own list of stuff.  Which was confusing, like his mom wants me to raise Timmy's grades more as he struggles with reading, and he thinks that we should enroll him in a club.  I was upset because it was all stuff I'd have to do additionally to my workload.  I said I wouldn't, he said I'd come around.

Then he said that I had put him in a bind for childcare the last two days, and asked if I would come and watch Timmy for him anyway.  I said I would help for a few days if we have a sit down and he tell Timmy that I'm not untrustworthy, as he had told the boy earlier.  He refused, saying that I proved I was untrustworthy by threatening to break up.  Then he asked if I would at least chaperone him to a birthday party that's coming up at a bounce-trampoline place.  I said absolutely not, that I was undermined authority and that was awful in a place that dangerous.

He left.

My friends went with me to get my stuff yesterday.  I've been a mess, but friends are convincing me to go out with them a few places next week and I might take up dance classes again starting February.

Thank you all for showing me I wasn't completely offbase

tl;dr:  He wanted more childcare.  I said no.  We broke up

[Update] I (27M) left my gf (25F) because she tried to have an affair,"So we had our talk last night. 

I got back and she tried to crack a couple of jokes like things were normal. 

I started it off and told her that I loved her. And I had for the nearly 8 years we were together. But this is something I can't forget or forgive. 

I told her I knew everything said between them. It disgusted me. That it hurt. Deeply. And that she did that. 

Now, I told her I didn't believe I'd be okay because of this for a long time. That's half true. This will of course take plenty of healing but I know I'll be okay. 

Now for her side: 

She told me that none of this had to do with me. None of it was my fault. It was all her. Her mistake her fuck up. She had been feeling unhappy just about life for a while. She felt stuck in life and aimless. 

Then this guy (an ex-friend) came along and gave her attention and it distracted her from how unhappy she was with how her life was. But then it started to progress to a point she didn't know what to do. 

None of what she said she meant to him. She said it because she knew he wanted to hear it. That it almost didn't seem real to her. It almost felt like a game. 

I told her it was real to me. That she still said those things. That she can't take that back or undo it.  

She told me she never intended to hurt me. That that's been the hardest thing for her. Because she knew I treated her better than anyone else will. That I'm the only person who had and will put up with her bullshit. She told me I really did treat her better than she deserved. 

This relationship is officially over though. 

I know there's probably more I wish I could've said but my real takeaway is that I can let go of it. Move on and start to live a new chapter of my life. 

I haven't told her this yet (I'm going to Monday) but I have an opportunity on a new place with a coworker. Their roommate leaves in a few months. So that gives me time to save and get some of my life back in order. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me. A lot of things to figure out. As plenty of people have pointed out, this will be the first time in a long time that I'll be financially and personally independent. I'll only have me to worry about. That's something that'll take some work. But I'm going to welcome the challenge and spend as much time as I can trying to be who I am more than ever. 

I also want to say from the bottom of my heart, sincerely, thank you to everyone that took the time to read and respond in the last post. This has been and will continue to be one of the hardest things I've gone through. But you guys have been so amazingly gracious with your advice. I will always remember this and the kindness of random strangers on this silly little website.

Update: My (36F) husband (40M) has been accused of harassment.,"Hello, I hope this is allowed by the rules. It's been more than 48 hours. Lots has happened so this may be a bit long. Writing things down seems to help and calms me. If the comments do get locked again, please send me any prayer requests you have. I am in a praying mood. If you pray, please pray for me and my family and all involved in this. If you don't, please send good thoughts. And for everyone be kind to each other.

I confronted him. I asked if he had ever been unfaithful. He looked like he was about to say no then he admitted four women and the nanny. Two were in a city he travels to frequently. One was a one night stand on a trip. And one was local. All told, he had a mistress for about seven of the thirteen years we were married. I can't imagine what the women went through. If they didn't know he was married, then they were victims. If they did know, then I hope they find peace from whatever demon caused them to sleep with a married man.  


I think I could've stayed with him if it had just been the women. Maybe, I can't say for sure. But the nanny was a violation of trust and an act of a troubled man. She had to fear for her job. I can't blame her in any way, and I'll reach out to her when the time is right to make sure again she knows she's loved.  


The kids cried when we told them. He's at an Airbnb until he can find more permanent housing. I'll stay here with the kids. The current nanny is moving in for the foreseeable future and my mother is coming to help. We'll all be ok.   


I did want to say one last thing. There were those who came into the original thread with hatred in their heart towards my husband's accuser. I looked at the place you came from, and it's vile and hurtful. I hope whatever pain in your life, current or past, that caused you to spew such hatred is exorcised and you find peace and love.

I want to ask my (M34) business partner (F31) to be with me romantically. How do I go about changing the context of our relationship?,"

**Background**: my childhood friend (F31) and I (M34) started a business together right out of college. We worked our asses off and became fairly successful. But we put our hearts and souls into it, and because of that our social lives suffered a lot. She was always better at balancing than I and had a long term boyfriend until about 7 months ago. They broke up- in part because he said she always prioritized the business over him (though they were also long distance at the end and that also played a role). 

She showed up at my house crying. We hang out, drink wine, watch movies. I'm chronically single and tipsy and she was now single and tipsy plus neither of us had had sex in a while and one thing led to another. We agreed the next day never to discuss it again. We didn't want to fuck up everything we've worked for or our friendship.

Well, this wasn't to be because she ended up pregnant. Zero scares with the ex, one night of drunken sex, bam pregnant. We discussed abortion, but she decided not to go through with it because she was concerned she wouldn't get another chance to be a mom. We agreed it could happen with someone far worse, we're already pretty irrevocably financially tied anyways, and we get along better than most people who actually tried to have kids. 

Living together just made sense- I have a house I inherited that's bigger than what either of us could've afforded just on our incomes, so there's room for each of us to have a bedroom plus a room for the baby. We spend most of our days together anyways because of work, so living together actually made that easier- now we can carpool. We have separate rooms, though we have been intimate since she moved in and sometimes share a bed. 

 I want to be with her. But I don't know how to move to that step. She's literally next to me asleep in bed. We go out to dinner together, spend most of our time together. I just don't know how to move that into a romantic context, or even if it's a good idea. I mentioned it to my sister who blew up at me and accused me of trapping her, and said that my partner would think I'm asking just because she's pregnant. But the truth is that I think I've always loved her, but I didn't want to admit it because she's way out of my league. 

So, what do I do? How do I change the context of the relationship when we're already so (financially, living together, family, etc) intertwined? 

TL;DR- I got my best friend/business partner pregnant, she moved in with me, I realized I love her, I don't know how to show her.

"[UPDATE] Fiance wanted an open marriage, so I called off the wedding. People are asking questions. Should I let them know why?","**Minor Update.**

I am at work, and I just received confirmation the Journal has been returned to my ex.

I sent it early in the morning with the courier that our office uses, and she had to sign a confirmation order that she received it (as some have recommended).

I came to the conclusion that reading it will not help, as she never took ownership of this whole situation.

Thank you.

​

I would like to thank u/Gavroche15 for his concise prediction of what had happened these past two weeks. You can read his thesis [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/96r4mc/fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called_off/e4ppclq).

Jokes aside, it has been an interesting two weeks since my initial post.

​

Monday last week I talked with a lawyer at work about the situation with the therapist. He looked at me like I was bullshitting him, and asked me if this was a prank. So I asked him if he wants to hear the recording. ""Damn right!"" was his answer. I talked again with him the next day, at the end of it.

He noted a few things I didn't pay attention to. On the recording, the therapist was always saying ""we think"", ""we want"", ""we talked about"", ""we decided"". Not once did she say ""Your Ex here asked me to talk with you"" or ""Your ex wants you to know"", or anything like that. It was always ""we this"", ""we that"".

He also asked me what my endgame is. Do I want to sue? He didn't think I personally have a case, to which I agreed. I never intended to sue anyway, but notify the appropriate institutions and let them deal with the therapist.

A decision was made to write two letters. One addressed to the clinic the therapist works at, and one for APA (we checked, she was accredited). By Wednesday there were a few more people at work aware of the situation, including one of the two case researchers. She dug up information about the therapist, online reviews, as well as the contacts for two of her previous patients. The therapist didn't have the best reviews, there were people upset with her, and we managed to track the two we talked with through social media. They were more than happy to help once we explained the situation, and their stories were not any better than mine.

The letters grew a consistent size, as we included the signed stories from the other two individuals, as well as my own description of how my ex changed once she started the therapy sessions, and a detailed description of how my meeting with the therapist went.

Friday last week I met with the parents. Her parents came to my parent's house, and we had the talk. My ex was there too, and more info was disclosed. That made its way to the report on the therapist as well.

This week, we sent the reports out. There was a reaction from the clinic. They called our office on Thursday morning, most probably to check if it is a prank or a real issue. We talked with their lawyer (or one of their lawyers) over the phone, and, when we confirmed it was legitimate, someone else was heard in the background, on their end, with a ""Well, crap!"" They said they are taking this very seriously. A conclusion from one of the guys at work was that they probably received other complaints before, but this is the first time someone did it so well documented. Their letter also mentioned we are reporting this to APA, that might have turned the heat on as well, hence their quick reaction.

I don't know what the result of this will be, and I consider my issue with it closed. However, having talked with the other two individuals that were ""treated"" by this therapist, I sincerely hope she is at least investigated, because she sounds insane and with an agenda (she ruined their relationships as well). One of the individuals was a woman, for the record.

​

Then, my ex and her parents.

​

Friday last week my parents called me and asked me to give them a visit after work. When I did, surprise! My ex and her parents were there too. My first reaction, seeing their cars in my parent's driveway, was to flee. This meeting was supposed to be on my terms, but she attempted to take the reigns to it. That was not going to happen, let me tell you.

My ex was waiting for me outside. She looked VERY good. If there was ever a girl you'd like your parents to meet, she was the image of it.

She told me ""they"" are here to talk with me, and see if we can fix this. ""They"" as in her parents. She either never told them what happened, or she gave them a version of a story they were not buying.

She had a journal with her. She told me she started writing in it before she began therapy, and continued writing in it until that Friday morning. That I should read it and it will clear out all this mess. I told her this is not a book club.

I wanted to go inside and get the circus going, but she asked me if I can give her ten minutes. She wants to talk with me for ten minutes before I talk with her parents. And she kept handing me her journal, and started crying. And then my sister showed up, and then my ex's sister showed up. They were already there, and came out to ""check on us"". So I took her journal, went inside, said hello, and lead my ex in the back of the garden, to an as isolated portion of my parent's garden as possible (they have a large garden with a lot of trees and benches).

She quit her job. The stress was too much, and she had a breakdown, it escalated, never got better. She is no longer seeing the therapist. She started seeing the therapist for work related matters, but somehow it turned into matters about our relationship, and it stayed focus on the relationship because it was the only thing the therapist seemed interested in. She never told her parents why she is my ex. She is seeing another therapist now.

I just listened.

She turned the discussion from ""her"" to ""us"". Told me I would be in control. I will be managing the finances. I will receive access to all her devices. I will be able to track everywhere she goes. Any property we will own will be in my name. She will do anything I want to trust her again. Basically things she said in her messages over the last weeks. She enumerated more things than the ones I mention. I don't know how she thinks that would be a healthy life, for either of us.

I asked her is she cheated. She told me she had the opportunity to cheat, but she had never. I believe her. But it also angered me. What does she mean ""she had the opportunity""? If you are in a committed relationship, you don't put yourself in a position where you have this opportunity. You don't want this opportunity. It's like saying ""I had the opportunity to kill someone today"". Why? What were you doing that there was such an opportunity. Why call it opportunity anyway, it makes it sound like something positive.

That pretty much ended our ten minutes, and told her we should go and talk with our parents.

So we did. I asked our sisters to leave us alone, as it was not any of their concern what was to be discussed. My sister huffed and puffed, but a house made of stone survives hurricanes - and she was not one.

Well, I talked, and explained what happened, how the therapy session went, and my resolve. I didn't mention I had a recording, because I never had to. My ex confirmed everything I said, which surprised me. Her father had teary eyes, and that broke my heart. Her mother asked her if this is how she thinks they raised her, and asked for an explanation.

My ex basically told them the same story. Stress at work. Depression. Breaking down. Therapy. Therapist wanting to talk only about our relationship. That the therapist told her our relationship was the root of all her stress. That the therapist convinced her I want an open relationship. That she might lose me if she doesn't level her sexual experience with me. How my reaction woke her up from her slump. She quit her job, is looking for something less stressful. She will do anything I want to get me back. Started crying.

My ex mentioned the journal again, and said if I read it, it will explain everything, and that she was not on board with the therapist's ideas, but she went along with them because the therapist was a person with authority and experience. Our parents looked at me and I told them someone's private journal is not the type of literature I read, unless they are a dead poet.

​

Big fucking mistake!

​

My intention was to relate that someone's private journals usually becomes literature if they are a famous writer, or leader, and usually they are published post mortem. Also, I was hoping they get the hint that I don't really want to read her journal, because it would be of no consequence. What was done was done. Everyone looked at me as if I wished death on my ex. You could smell the hostility in the air.

So I said ""fine, fine"" and ""promissed"" I will read her journal. You win some, you lose some, and then you use the wrong words and you lose a few more.

My ex is seeing a new therapist. She showed her parents emails confirming her appointments. He's an older dude, with a white beard like Freud. I searched him online, he is married, he attends conferences, he wrote a few books (they are on Amazon, ha!), seems like a solid character.

​

""Can you kids work this out?""

​

This was the second thing that angered me that day. As if this is child play, and we should just listen to the adults. We are not old enough to be in control of our own feeling, and we should definitely not be the ones to decide what we consider a betrayal you can't recover from. We are just ""kids"" and we should just work it out. So I won back some ground on the ""dead poets society"" remark earlier.

​

And this is how the day ended.

​

We've known each other for 9 years, and have been a couple for 5 years. Even if there are legitimate reasons behind her behavior, how do you go back to being the same? This wasn't even a reset. My way of thinking about my ex has been fundamentally changed. She became a stranger I know a lot of things about. Sure, I still find her attractive. VERY attractive, they way she looked last Friday was amazing. No denying that. But it was also calculated, I am not going to lie myself here. Hair done the way I like it, dress that I bought for her, the shoes I like the most, a hint of the perfume I gifted her, etc.

​

The journal...

...is on my nightstand. I haven't read it, and I probably never will. I did look through it, to see if it indeed is a year old, and it is. The way the pages folded, the ink is clearly older on the first pages, and you can see it progressing through the pages. The pen she used was attached to the journal, and I tested it, looks like the same ink. And the ink level in the pen is consistent with how much I assume the pen has been used for the last year to write the journal. It is not a fake. Everything about it is consistent with a year's worth of wear and tear.

​

I don't see what good reading it will make me. A tool to play with one's mind? Well, not rally, I don't think a year ago when she started writing it she intended to use it as manipulation. If what she told me is right, her new therapist suggested the idea to share the journal with myself.

​

As for how I am handling people that are too curious about why the wedding is off? ""We had a huge difference of opinion that we could not find a solution to."" More or less.

But if her sister finds out why, and this is more than likely, because her sister is very close to their mother, everyone will find out the real reason why.

​

Our parents want us to meet again next week. They told me to read the journal, and maybe that helps. Maybe we can work on it. Start again, fresh, since we have so much history. She will get treatment, she will get better, she still is the same woman I fell in love with, but she is not well right now. They can tell I still love her, or else I would not be so ""theatrical"", their words, not mine.

​

I don't think I will meet them next Friday.

​

But, damn! She did look amazing!

​

I would like to thank the community for the support and help. It was enough to help me put together a plan of action regarding the therapist. Thank you to those who provided resources and information about what to do.

Skinny wife happy life?,"Since my husband and I had our first child he doesn't want to do anything just the two of us even when our daughter is staying overnight at grandparents house.  If I brought it up he would give me the same story that  we would do something next time we're alone, but every time she was away he didn't feel like going anywhere.  About a year and half ago,  when arguing about him once again not wanting to have a date night alone. He brought up that the reason he never wants to take me out is because he was ashamed to be seen with me because I wasn't the same size I was before I had my daughter. Im 5'8 and was 140-150lbs before I had a  kid and I'm not going to lie I was struggling to lose weight and weighed 180lbs.  That remark cut me deeply. After that he quit wanting sex,  I had a hysterectomy and the thought of no longer being able to have more kids led to depression and  he began insulting me more telling me I was worthless, oink at me, and if he sees me changing clothes he will look at me with an appalled disgusted face and walk out of the room.  when I was awake I would repeatedly tell myself your disgusting, your worthless, my family is embarrassed to be seen with me over and over all day. Sleeping became the only way to stop the intrusive negative thoughts I had, so I slept all day while my daughter was at school. I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed antidepressants but  they made me drowsy so I was still sleeping a lot.  I've gained 50 more pounds in the last year and I cannot get motivated to do anything anymore. I've distanced myself from friends and family, and I hate going anywhere because im embarrassed to make eye contact with people, even with total strangers. My husband told me about one of his coworkers having weight loss surgery and keeps mentioning that i should look into having it done.  He says all of our problems revolve around my weight gain and says I'll have more confidence in myself if I get it done.

Thanks r/relationship_advice for being so blunt!,"I (33f) posted in here about 2.5yrs ago under an old profile regarding my marriage. The post was taken down by a mod for violating a rule or two, though I'll be damned if I remember which. However, I did get some great comments. My old post had to do with the shit way my (43m) husband  was treating me—financially abusive, emotionally neglectful, cheating, lying asshole. At the time I was still a stay at home mom to my younger two girls, and he was becoming increasingly hostile towards my oldest daughter from a previous relationship. Well reddit, it took a while, and a few more really hard lessons, but in September 2018 I moved out of my marital home and into my very own townhome. If I had never posted here, I would only have my own perception of the relationship, instead of knowing how it looks to others. I now work full time, go to college part time. I started to open up to those close to me, and garnered the support I needed to gtfo. I had originally arranged to move out on a Monday while he was at work, but Murphey's law kicked in at the last minute and HE STAYED HOME SICK THAT DAY! My oldest daughter had stayed home from school to help me move, and we had reserved a moving truck, so when she asked what we were going to do, I told her we would move anyway. He slept through my first load, having no idea of my plans because he'd have been even more financially abusive if he knew what I was planning. When he realized what was going on, he got very angry, lots of threats etc. But, I got out, we worked out a way to coparent without wanting to murder each other (often), and divorce is somewhere in the future. Sorry if this isn't for this thread, but I just had to say thanks for being so blunt about my failing marriage that it made me cry sad and angry tears. I needed it.

My(25M) girlfriend(26F) wants me to have sex with her best friend(26F),"For starters, I love my girlfriend more than anything. Our year together has been the best time of my life, and I hope I can call her my wife one day because she's the best thing this planet has to offer, bar none. She's so ridiculously selfless it's a joke.


Her best friends boyfriend left her a month ago after cheating on her with multiple different women. She's not in a good place to say the least. My girlfriend is spending a hell of a lot of time with her recently and not so much with me. (Which is fine in my eyes, her best friend is in a crisis right now and she's being supportive.) My girlfriend said to her that she would ask me if I could spend a night with her to help her feel better, which was my girlfriends idea.


Yesterday night we were together and she was talking about her friend with me and she was saying that she was lonely, felt rejected, and is desperate for attention. My girlfriend asked me if I found her friend at all attractive and I was a little taken back by it but she's a good looking girl (not as good looking as my girlfriend obviously) so I was kind of what just like 'yeah, sure'. She explained to me that she would ask me if I would sleep with her once just to help her feel better, and she went on to say that she's not only OK with it, but she really wants me to do this, going as far as to say 'please, do it for me if not for her'. She promised me that she's OK with it and she won't get jealous or anything. I told her I would think about it.


I guess I wouldn't mind just the once but I don't want to be pimped out every time her friend feels a little upset or lonely, I'm not just some toy to be shared. On one hand I would like to help but on the other hand this seems kind of out there. What would you do in this situation?

My mother posted a photo of another girl in her Facebook post when she was wishing me happy birthday.,"I know social media is toxic and I barely use it.

Yesterday was my birthday and I got tagged in a post so I checked it out and my mother posted a photo of another girl in her graduation photos parading it around like it was me on Facebook.( more than one post)

I am feeling hurt and upset since we just took a trip together and took so many wonderful pictures together, it was a special time for me and it makes me sad that she used someone else's photos instead of a photo of me to wish me a happy birthday.

When I pointed it out to her (publicly on the post) she just posted ""lol I'm getting old"" but this hurts so much because the girl is fat like I am we don't look alike at all. the girl in the picture is darker skinned than I am has black hair (mine is dyed blonde) and the girl is in her cap and gown (I haven't finished my education yet)

I feel as though she wants me to be this girl she saw pictures of instead of being me. I don't feel loved and I asked her to take down the post but she hasn't yet.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I overreacting? I think my mom should know what I look like. Am I being insecure of immature about this situation?

Edit 1: She deleted the post and has not said a word to me.

Edit 2: I called her to thank her for taking it down. She said very shortly, ""I can post a picture of a flower or something and you won't get upset I pick that picture because I want you to graduate soon"" and then hung up on me.",relationship_advice
I was drunk and pretended to be asleep so I wouldn't have to talk to my boyfriend but It turned dark.,"I (21f) was on a work night out two nights ago and drank a bit but wasn't too drunk just tipsy. My boyfriend also went out for drinks and met me afterwards and we went home together.
He was acting rude towards me and was pissed off that I walked out of the nightclub with a male colleague that he knows I'm friends with.

Fast forward to when we're in bed, turned off the lights and start to cuddle. He asks if I'm alright and I didn't answer I wasn't in the mood to talk and he just presumed I was asleep.

This is where it turns weird on both our parts, I'm slightly embarrassed to say I let it go this far but at the same time I wanted to see what he was going to do I DID NOT let it go on because I liked what was happening because I genuinely felt sick. 

He put his hand down my pants and started rubbing and when I didn't react he spit on his fingers and put them in me. He then went to the other hole which is something I would never let him do and something we have never done before. I held back every urge to stop him because I needed to see what he was capable of.

He started to wank off and then started going under the covers with the torch on his phone. This is where I couldn't let it go on any further and I started to 'wake up' I asked what was he doing and he said nothing and asked was I okay and started to tickle my back till I 'fell asleep' again.

He tried the flash light thing 2 more times and then ran into the bathroom. After he was in the bathroom awhile I asked was he okay and he said he was taking a shit. 

Now I've asked him to move out and he's making it difficult saying he'll convince me to stay with him. He doesn't know I know what he did, as far as he's aware I was blackout drunk.

EDIT/UPDATE: I packed up his stuff and had it ready when he finished work. My mom was home too so at least I had someone nearby.

He sat down and told me he thinks I'm making a rash decision since he thinks this is all over choking and a bite mark he left on me. He went on and on about how he won't do it again and said he'll get help and he wants this to work.

I caught him off guard and asked what was he doing with a flashlight under the covers and his whole face went white he was shaking and blamed it on his heart beating. He said he fingered me for 10 seconds because I was talking back to him which made him think I was awake which I know wasn't true and that he went down with a flashlight because he thought I was bleeding and had to check it wasn't on the sheets.

He ended up saying he felt sick and I said it's because he's caught out and feels guilt. I also told him I might go to the police over the bite. He played victim and stuck to his story even tho I know what really happened.",relationship_advice
Update: Caught SO (25M) with my (22F) best friend (23F),"Thank you for everyone who commented saying to cut them both off my life. It made me see that this is not how a best friend and boyfriend would act. 

Just a little update:

My (ex)friend reached out to me and told me that she thinks my boyfriend and I aren't compatible, and that our relationship probably won't last. This really pissed me off. I told her that I saw them that night. She was upset and kept apologizing, insisted that it was a mistake (stuff like that) I told her I didn't want to talk and that was that. I then confronted my (ex)boyfriend and he confessed that they have hooked up before. 

I have since blocked them both. I feel so hurt and I'm not sure when I'm going to feel okay again 

TLDR: Found out my bf hooked up with my friend in the past. I'm moving on

"I[22m] like the girl[19f], but should I ask her if she's left something in her vagina?","So I started seeing this girl a little while ago and we moved things to the bedroom relatively quickly. We didn't do anything the first time we hung out as she was on her period, but the second time was a bit more active.

We'd gone back to her place and while I was laying down some finger work I swear I could feel something inside of her. Weird thought, I know, but it felt a bit cramped and like something artificial was there. There was a bit of an odor too, but I'd initially just put that down to iffy higene or something. So I was second guessing myself trying to work out if I'd imagined something inside this girls vagina. Part of me is saying it's ridiculous, but the other part is running through possibilities. What if its a tampon or something that's just been forgotten? 

The kicker is this girl says she's never masturbated, so I really don't know how often she'd get the chance to check. 

I feel paranoid and a little immature worrying about this, but I can't help but fret. Do I ask/tell her about it? Ignore it? I want to keep seeing this girl, but I have no idea how to even approach this issue. 

Any advice? 

Edit: I've sent her a message. Here's hoping she doesn't cancel our date later 👍

Edit2: She was very relieved I'd told her as I was right, she had forgotten a tampon. All is good now, thanks for the advice everyone!

Edit3: Date went well! Going to bed now, with her. Thanks again reddit! <3

"I (22M) crossed a major boundary, how do we (21F) talk about it?","Hey guys, first off I apologize if my formatting isn't very ""reddit-like"". I almost never actually post on Reddit.

So I made a mistake tonight..and I'm ashamed of myself because this was completely out of character for me..but now I need to fess up. I'm going to give a bit of context and then sum up my questions underneath.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend left her laptop with me because it died and she needed me to try to recover family photos and documents from the last 7 years that would have all been lost. While transferring the data I was popping in and out of folders to make sure everything was being captured, when a particular phrase on one of the screenshots in a photo folder caught my eye..something she says to me often and we've come to sort of associate the phrase with us. The screenshot was her confession of love to someone she was with before I was around, ending with that quote, our quote.

&#x200B;

I couldn't leave well enough alone..and the next thing I knew I had opened up her internet browser..sure enough facebook was logged in. and I searched that phrase in the conversation history. There were..more than a few results. I read through some of them, more than I'd like to admit. I couldn't believe how many guys she had dated before me, she had never hidden it from me. I knew she had dated alot more people than I had, but the number of guys..I wasn't expecting it. Many of them she had said similar or the exact same things she says to me. Some conversations she had even sent out the same ""intimate"" photos I received from her when we started dating. (some of the guys were within a short span and didn't last very long) I'm a little hurt to be honest. Alot of the things I thought were exclusive to us were not, is this normal? I've always intentionally avoided saying things I used to say to exes.

&#x200B;

That aside, I know I messed up. I completely betrayed her trust by going through all those conversations and I need to come clean about it. On one hand I'm a little hurt..on the other I shouldn't have even known about this.  How can I discuss this with my partner in a healthy way? Is it fair for me to feel a little hurt at the same time?

Edit: Ok I wanted to clarify because alot of you seem to think I'm expecting an apology from her which I'm definitely not. I know that I screwed up and shouldn't have snooped. I violated a major boundary and I would be pissed if I were her (that's why I feel it needs to be confessed)  For the sake of being honest and open I'm going to talk to her about it and face the fallout. I think some of you are right and I have some..confused feelings about it. To my knowledge I don't make her feel anywhere close to what she's expressed with past partners and it is a little upsetting, not because I'm not the first one or because she's had ""too many"". That's not at all what I'm getting at..


&#x200B;

 TL;DR I snooped through my girlfriend's facebook chats with her exes and realized she says the exact same things to me that she said to all of them, and I feel bad for violating her trust and need to confess to her what I did.

Update: Hey everyone! Sorry for the delay between posts. 

So we talked it out. She agreed that it was an invasion of privacy but also says I have her permission to go through her messages anytime but to just tell her first..not the response I had expected. We had a decent conversation about both sides. Everything is good between us. Thank you all for your insights and messages it's greatly appreciated!",relationship_advice
"UPDATE to ""He's(25) falling out of love and I(25f) don't know what to do"": Why he avoided me.","[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b17a0h/hes25_falling_out_of_love_and_i25f_dont_know_what/)

What happened after I made the post: I wrote him a letter, hinting that this relationship won't work if it continues like this. I also printed the post I had made and the comments I got. I thought maybe it helps if he sees it from a different perspective. I put the letter and what I printed on the bed, together with a photo book of an amazing vacation we had. I then removed the SIM card from my phone, a), because I didn't want to communicate with him until he read what I had left on the bed, and b), because the phone was actually his old one as my actual phone had been sent in to be repaired, and had now arrived at my parents', and that's were I wanted to spend the weekend. Then I picked up all our pets, and left for my home town (I always take them with me when I visit my parents).

Apparently, he came home early from work, only about an hour after I had left, to a deserted apartment. When I put the SIM card back into the repaired phone about 7 hours later, he had left a few messages, saying that he had read what I had written and printed out, thought a lot about all this, he had looked through the photo book, and had a conversation with a friend. That friend is almost twice as old as we are, used to be his drinking buddy and is sort of a father figure for my boyfriend. He said that this friend had gone through the same situation with his wife. Apparently, he had been so stressed out by his job going downhill, he tried to safe it by working longer hours, which sometimes created some tension between his wife and him, so he avoided her by going out for drinks every night, creating a vicious cycle of her being unhappy about not seeing him and him avoiding her even more.

But he had found a solution. He realised that his job shouldn't define his life. He made a list of goals he wants to tick off each week. His marriage has apparently been going very well since then (it's the reason why I said he used to be my boyfriend's drinking buddy!).

My boyfriend said it dawned on him. He's in the same situation. He's putting in as much effort as the CEO who doesn't even appreciate his work. He doesn't want to lose me, I'm the best thing that has ever come to his life. He apparently cried a lot and made his own list of goals he wants to tick off each week. When I came back Sunday night, I found it on our fridge. It has very specific goals about him working less overtime and making up for the lost time by taking time off, spontanously going out only once a week max with his drinking buddies, and spending time with me doing real activities at least twice a week.

Since then, our dynamic has changed entirely. We had sex. We cuddled. We talked. He was there. Now it's only been 6 days since I made the post, but I hope it stays this great between us. I guess the realisations he had could help with him keeping up his new goal habits.

Weirdly, all the talks we had before when I told him I was unhappy because we didn't see each other much probably contributed to him avoiding me even more after already being stressed from work. This ""talk"" was different, because it made him realise that he'd lose me if it continued like this, and because it made him reach out to his friend. Maybe the deserted apartment contributed as well, because it was a little taste into life without me.

TL;DR: I probably owe my boyfriend's friend big time.",relationship_advice
Tricky areas with consent in my relationship.,"Hi everyone!! 

I'm a 17 year old girl stuck in a bit of an uncomfortable mind space. I have a 19 year old boyfriend and we've been best friends since I was 13. We started dating when I was 15, and started having sex pretty much as soon as I turned 16. So, he's a very significant part of my life and has been for a very long time. 

He is kind and patient. He's funny, and we like the same video games and places to go. We have fun and he cares for me a lot. 
He makes me feel loved and sexy. He makes me feel wanted. I love being around him and I care about him so much. 

However, there are a few sexual situations that have made me a bit worried. I haven't been able to discuss them with any real life friends as I really don't want to disrespect my boyfriend or tarnish his reputation. 

These are a few examples of the awkward sex times: 

- he fingered me in the butthole when I asked him not to. He initially asked if I wanted him to pop a finger in, to which I adamantly said no to, and he put it in anyway. I told him to stop and to get out but he just kept fingering me. I froze and he finished and afterwards I told him how I didn't want him to and he joked about it. He continues to do it in sex. 

- he came inside me when I asked him not to. I have an IUD so I'm usually totally fine with having him cum inside me but I had a new one placed and my gynaecologist told me to use condoms while my body adjusted. We compromised and agreed on the pull out method. When he was about to cum, he asked me what I wanted, and I requested he pull out. Then he asked again and I reaffirmed it. Then he kept having sex with me before saying that he was cumming inside me. I asked him to pull out but he just kept at it. I cried after sex. He made jokes about it afterwards. I brought it up a few days later and told him it upset me and he said he felt like a real piece of shit for it and I ended up comforting him. 

- said I didn't want to have sex when he woke me up at 3am for it, as I felt sick. He then got quite upset with me until I sort of felt like I had to say yes to avoid him being angry with me or him having issues with me? We fucked even though I felt like I was going to spew and he knew how poorly I was. 

- wanted to do anal. I didn't want to. Got me really drunk to try it. It hurt and I asked him to stop. He asked me to keep trying. I said it hurt. He stopped. 

These are a few examples. I'm not sure how well my semi illiterate brain is at communicating these events but I've just sort of been worrying about them.

I tend to get a bit anxious during sex because it feels very out of my control. I feel like he could do anything and if I said no, it wouldn't really matter. This is such a frustrating way to feel because he's such a good and kind lover.

He's so caring towards me particularly when I'm dealing with the symptoms to a chronic illness I have, and tries hard to make me happy. 

We get along so well and I really want to be a good partner sexually for him. 

Should I be more open sexually? Should I let him try more things? 
If it's not an issue with me, how should I communicated it to him? 
He knows that the sex when I was sick made me feel pressured and that it upset me that he came inside me when I requested he didn't. He doesn't know that the fingering thing made me feel a bit sad. Is it worth bringing up again or should I just be more firm?

Please help! I've no idea if I'm not being good enough and I don't want to hurt him. I need advice! I don't have anyone else to turn to about it.  

TLDR: my boyfriend is amazing and I love him but sex gets a little bit sad for me sometimes. Am I doing something wrong?

My bf (20M) lied to me about wearing a condom. What do I do now??,"I originally posted this on r/sex but was advised to post it here as well to get additional feedback. 

So my bf and I just got a new apartment together a few weeks ago and are kinda new to the living together thing. Since we are still sorting out our financial situation and I'm not on the pill, I asked him to buy condoms bc I didn't want an accident to happen and I either have to buy an emergency contraceptive or end up pregnant. He initially said no but after about 2 days he agreed (although rather grumpily). Tonight during sexy time, he wore a condom and then afterwards took it off and threw it away. A little while later, he asked if I wanted to go for round two and I agreed. I felt him reach for another condom and heard the crinkling of the wrapper and even him opening the wrapper so naturally I assumed he put a new one on. Midway through, he asked if he could take off the condom and I told him no. He  then told me that he actually hadn't been wearing one the whole time during round two. I immediately got out from under him and got upset. I felt like he broke my trust. He then actually put the condom on and said for me to calm down and that he was just playing around and wanted to continue since he now had a condom on. I was still very upset and told him no bc that's not cool. He got angry and took the condom off and threw it at the wall. I then got dressed and went to the spare bedroom. I heard him get out of bed and close the door after me. After cooling down for a few hours, I was going to go back and talk to him but I found the door locked. He locked me out of the room. I then texted him that I was sorry but that he shouldn't have done that. I little bit later and I heard snoring in the room and the door is still locked so I'm staying in the guest bedroom tonight. I am still kinda upset and can't shake the feeling of betrayal. I personally don't think that I'm in the wrong but maybe I'm just too close to the situation. Am I the bad guy?? Am I overreacting?? Does he have a right to be mad at me?? Please give any advice you may have. I would really appreciate it.

UPDATE: First of all, I just wanted to say that I didn't expect to get so much interaction let alone well wishes and support. I am so thankful for everyone and although I can't reply to every comment, I'm at least trying to look at them all. Also, I am back on birth control. Now on to what happened yesterday. 

When I woke up Friday morning, bf was already up and getting ready for work. As soon as he left, I went into his room and started gathering my belongings to move into the guest bedroom. I guess he forgot something bc he came back inside and found me in his room collecting my things. He told me that he loved me and that he was sorry for what he did and he shouldn't have been the one to get mad. He also said that although he didn't want me to, he wouldn't stop me from moving my things into the guest bedroom if that's what I wanted. I should have said something to him then but I knew that what I had to say was a lot more than the 10 minutes he had before he had to leave for work so I stayed quiet and looked at the floor. He hugged me and called me his baby and then left for work fr this time. We didn't speak anymore until later that evening when I asked him if he could pick me up from work (I currently don't have a car). He agreed. During the ride home, he acted casually as if nothing had happened less than 24 hours before. When we got home, bf started cooking dinner. I didn't know how to start the conversation so I sat and thought on it. Later that night, I went into his room and he already knew why I was in there. I told him that what he did the night before was NOT okay and that since we got the apartment he had been meaner and way more aggressive toward me which lead me to think that he didn't actually want to get the apartment. I reminded him of the condom incident and a few others before that and told him if he wanted to break the lease, we could and that I would find another place to stay in the meantime. He started crying and apologized and said that he didn't even realize what he was doing and that he didn't want to be like his dad (who was very abusive). He said that it wasn't his intention and that he was very sorry. He also said that he loved getting the apartment and wanted to stay. He also said that if I wanted to keep my stuff in the guest bedroom, he would respect and support my decision and that I was welcome to the master with him whenever I felt like it. He said that he appreciates me telling him about his fuck ups so he can learn from them and that he'd do his best to be better. Then we said good night and I went back to my room.

HELP: I slept with a guy nearly 48hrs ago and he won't leave my place!!!!,"Update here for alk who asked: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apawjv/update_i_slept_with_a_guy_48hrs_ago_and_now_he/?utm_source=reddit-android

I am recently out of a long-term relationship, and its been a long time since I have 'dated', so I have been meeting guys from Tinder for hook-ups and dates. I went on a date with this guy on Friday night, and it was okay, he seemed nice and we ended up going back to mine and hooking up. Anyway...fast forward to, well, NOW, and the dude is STILL HERE. I'm used to a guy staying for a while the next day, having coffee or whatever, but he slept over Saturday night too, and now I'm worried he is going to end up staying tonight too. He's been here way too long now and I have no idea how to get rid of him. He used my toilet, and I had forgotten to put more paper in there...he called me to the toilet to give him some paper because he shit in my toilet. HE SHIT IN MY TOILET. That's how long he's been here...he's had a shit. Idk I just think one nighters have overstayed their welcomes when they shit at your place. 

I have politely said on Saturday 'I have a lot to be getting on with today', and 'I have some errands to run', but he didn't get himself ready to go or anything, and I really don't wanna leave him in my place unattended. I even got dressed, put my coat on and told him I was going out and he just asked if I could grab him a coffee on my way back (!!!!!!). I did say today that he should probably leave soon as I need to get myself sorted for work Monday, and he just said 'yeah no problem'...but that was 3 hours ago and he is still chilling in my bed watching TV.

I'm really worried now because I need to go to work tomorrow and I'm scared that he won't EVER leave. I told him that I need to work Monday and he just changes the subject and asks about my work. How do I get him to leave? I've been in situations before where guys have turned in a bad way when I have refused advances, not given them my number etc, only this is worse because he is in my apartment and I am worried that he might turn nasty when we are alone. 

Probs worth noting that I suspected nothing at dinner on Friday night, he didn't seem like a weirdo or anything. Guess I didn't realise I'd be gaining a live-in boyfriend after one date and some drunk mediocre sex. What is the best way to deal with all of this?

My (F 26) husband (27) acted crazy last night and choked me and now today he thinks everything is fine.,"My husband and I got into an argument the other night because I saw text notifications on his phone from her that literally said ""I haven't been with another man who's been as good as you were in bed lol"". It's even worse because he has cheated on me once before with her, but as far as I knew they haven't been talking recently. I asked him about it and he tried to brush it off but I was being jealous and insecure and I couldn't let it go. He walked away from me and told me ""I can't talk to you when you're like this"". I just cried alone in the living room and than after a while he called for me to ""come here"". I did and he pulled me onto his lap and told me to stop crying and he wiped my tears. He told me that he can't control what she says, and told me that he only loves me. He told me, ""she's not like you, I couldn't be with a girl like her"". I told him I was sorry and he nodded but than he just stopped smiling and freaked out on me all of a sudden. He pushed me onto my back on our bed and he put his hand around my throat and started choking me. He told me something like ""just a warning though, nobody likes a jealous woman babe"". I tried to put my hand on his to move it but he whispered ""don't be stupid"". He just stared at me until I surrendered and then he eased his grip. He told me, ""I don't want you to talk to me like that again, okay?"". I told him yes and he let go of me. And then he told me gently to take my clothes off. I said ""what?"". And he told me again to take them off but this time he tapped my throat with his finger and told me ""I don't like asking twice"". I just did what he said and I said sex with him. It wasn't angry sex or anything, he wasn't very rough. If anything he was more caring and passionate than usual. After that, he was nice to me the rest of the night and has been today. I just don't see how he acts like everything is fine when I have bruises on my neck. Maybe I'm being crazy but he just scared me. I just don't understand him. I know he shouldn't treat me like this. I just don't get how he can turn his anger on and off. I don't know what I should do.",relationship_advice

Husband's Co-Worker,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 16. We are high school sweethearts. We just had our first child in August this year. I am 32 and he is 34. 

My husband works full time as a pharmacist, and I work at the power board. We have a great relationship, and rarely argue. He is my best friend. 

He took a position at a 24 hour Pharmacy as a staff pharmacist to train for a management position in 2015. This is one of the busiest pharmacies in our area. There are 15 technicians and 5 pharmacists including him at this location. They hired a new tech there that I will call Jane. She is 24 and married with 3 kids. I think she may have gotten pregnant with her third child after working there. Anyway she was a hard worker and my husband got along just fine with her and everyone there. 

However, she started texting him about work related things when he wasn't at work and started calling him Bossman. I was annoyed by her calling him that but I let it go. 

When I would go visit my husband at his work, she was always always overly complimentary to me. Telling me I was the cutest pregnant person ever, etc. I didn't think much of that as that is not my personality type but each to their own. She added me as a friend on Facebook and I accepted. I am friends with multiple coworkers of my husband both male and female. 

She began telling my husband about her marital problems. That she thought her husband was cheating on her, etc. She also wanted him to pick her up and take her to work when the weather was bad, she had car trouble, and other reasons. Now the current pharmacy manager does all this, so my husband didn't see an issue with it. So he picked her up a few times when the weather was bad. 

Fast forward to May of this year, my husband gets promoted to pharmacy manager and Jane wants to transfer to his store. She picks up all the extra shifts there. I'm still pregnant with my daughter and this point, and so I go see him one night. She straight up avoids me. I try to speak to her to be nice and she ignores me. So I ask my husband, he shrugs and says he don't know. 

The texts start increasing and it's more non work related stuff than work related stuff. She starts tagging him in things on Facebook and I am uncomfortable with it. So I tell him to put a stop to it. The final straw is she asks my husband to pick her up at a car dealership and take her to work since her car is being serviced. Keep in mind that her husband works at the dealership where her car is being serviced and they have a vehicle each. That's when I lost it and put my foot down. 

Well she no longer wanted to transfer to his pharmacy after he told her the texts and asking for rides had to stop. She basically went silent. I was still fuming and friends with her on Facebook so I posted a meme and she deleted me. She did not block me just deleted me. 

She told everyone at work that I didn't like her and she just didn't understand why and she wasn't transferring to his store anymore because my husband didn't like her. 

My husband had to go back to the store she works at to take care of something and he didn't speak to her, she went to a coworker and was on the verge of tears because my husband didn't speak to her. 

So anyway she gets a new job at the hospital and leaves the pharmacy. I'm so glad to be done with her and the fact my husband will never see her again until she tells another coworker at that Walgreens who I am very good friends with that she is coming back on 1/10/19 because she doesn't make enough money at the hospital and has filed for divorce from her husband. I'm not too upset by this. He rarely ever has to go to that store and will never see her. 

Well on Friday we got news he is going to be promoted to manager of that store and his first day there will be around the time that Jane starts back working there. I trust my husband completely but I just don't know how to handle this situation.  They will be working together every day. 

Now I realize that a lot of this stuff happened while I was pregnant and hormonal but I just have a bad feeling about all of it. 

Any advice is appreciated, and I'm so sorry for the long read. ",relationship_advice
"Girlfriend (22/f) slept with the bartender (31/m) at work party back in November. She finally broke down and told me (24/m) everything today, claiming she was taken advantage of. I feel sick and I'm not sure what to do. Would you consider this cheating?","# IMPORTANT UPDATE #2:

I have decided to side with my girlfriend and support her as we figure this out. I'm not going to pretend everything is fine, and I'm not promising that we'll make it through this. Honestly I have a feeling we probably won't. But we've been together for 3 years and I believe her about what happened. I think she is a victim even if she didn't handle everything correctly that night. I'm going to support her and try to figure out the full story.

I've read every comment in here. I was responding to many with information in these updates, but there are far too many to reply to. Most of the top comments were posted early and are quick to tell me to break up. If you read the rest, they are probably split 60/40 about whether she set it all up or if she was assaulted.

To everyone saying that she should break up with me for how I have handled this so far. Please try to understand how emotional this ordeal has been for both of us. She came to me saying she made a mistake and that it was her fault. And she hid it for over a month. I only learned all of this *yesterday* and I freaked out.

\---

Original post:

This has turned into a wall of text so I thank anyone who reads. It's probably too much detail, but it's been therapeutic to write it all out.

**Background**

I (24/m) have been going out with my girlfriend (22/f) for just over 3 years. We do not live together. We were both living at our parents' houses while attending university but I recently graduated and now have my own place with a roommate. She still lives with her mom, but we have had a few discussions about moving in together.

I work full-time at an office job and she is in class with a part-time restaurant job on the side. She started this job at the beginning of November and was hired by one of her friends. She told me it was annoying that several of the male staff members constantly flirted with her and made inappropriate jokes despite her being in a relationship. This includes the restaurant's bartender (31/m).

In late November (only a couple weeks after she started), the staff had their annual Christmas party at the restaurant. It was on a Monday night since the restaurant is closed Tuesday mornings.

Later that week, my girlfriend was also supposed to be housesitting/dogsitting for a friend. She had to go feed the dog every day and was allowed to stay overnight if she wanted (starting Tuesday). We were talking about how we both thought it was hot to have sex in someone else's house, and planned to have a few wild nights when we got the chance.

**My side of the story**

I stayed home the night of the party. I was told it was staff only (no significant others) and I had work in the morning, so I  had no problem staying in. I dropped my girlfriend off and I was texting her throughout the night. At around 11 I told her I was going to sleep and said goodnight. I was still up another hour or so, but based on her texts she was quite drunk and it was frustrating having a regular conversation, so I didn't want to text any more.

I sent her a message the next morning and didn't hear back until around 2pm, when she informed me she was extremely hungover and slept half the day. Even though her mom's house was just around the corner from the restaurant, she said she instead decided to go to the dogsitting house (a day early) since it was on the way to the bar that some people headed to after the party. Apparently the homeowners left earlier Monday night.

We hung out later that night and she showed me photos of the party. I saw most people brought their significant others, and I was kind of insulted. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't think we were supposed to be invited and that I shouldn't have cared since I had work the next day anyways. We had a minor disagreement but nothing serious.

The next couples days were normal, we were happy, and Thursday night I suggested we go over the dogsitting house together. She started acting weird and said she didn't want to do that any more, but we could hang out at my place. We did, watched some tv, and I tried to initiate sex. She refused and said I was being too pushy and went home. I didn't think I did anything wrong and I was frustrated.

The next two weeks or so were more of the same. No sex, which led to frustration and silly arguments over little things. She started exams in mid/late December and stress was through the roof. Finally, after she finished exams we went out to a party, went home together and had sex. It had been probably 3 weeks, and previously we were having sex \~5 times a week.

Over the Christmas break we resumed having lots of sex, but things still didn't feel right. There were lots of arguments. We both returned to work/school and it seemed like every day there was some new disagreement. And now today... we were fighting about something stupid (whether or not her friend calling me ""Garfield"" should be insulting), and trying to resolve it. I made an offhand comment about how these little fights shouldn't bother me so much, it's not like she cheated on me.

And then she broke down. She started sobbing and saying that she made a huge mistake at the Christmas party. She said she couldn't bear to tell me and wanted to kill herself.

**Her side of the story**

After the crying stopped, I made her tell me what happened. I was pretty pissed off and yelling because she basically told me she cheated on me a MONTH AND A HALF ago and tried to hide it. This is her side. A lot of it is pieced together from her messages and what her coworkers told her, since she has no little memory of the night.

The party was open-bar, and she and her friend were hanging out at at bar most of the night. The bartender was another employee who had volunteered to take the night off from drinking to serve everyone else. Partway through the night, he started giving her drinks that she wasn't even asking for. She was having a good time and accepted them. Eventually she got blackout drunk, still pretty early in the night too. She doesn't remember me texting her goodnight, which was only around 11pm.

At midnight, she texted the dogsitting people asking if she could go over that night. There was no answer of course, since they were on an international flight somewhere. Everyone kept drinking until about 12:30 am. Around 1 am, the bartender drove a group of people from the party to a bar. He returned to the party to drive the last carload of people to the bar. Everyone else had made their way home by this point.

He dropped everyone at the bar except my girlfriend. He told the others he would drive her home, but together they then went back to the dogsitting house. I don't know the exact details of what happened next. But around 3 am, she sent a photo to their work group chat. It includes her, the bartender, and the dog in a bed. You could only see from their shoulders up but they were obviously shirtless. She included a message that said ""I hope everyone is having a good time! I know we are!""

She insists she has zero recollection of this happening. She woke up Tuesday lunchtime and was surprised she wasn't in her own bed. The bartender wasn't there when she got up and there was no sign of him. She said she assumed she must have decided to go out to the bar after, which is why she asked to stay at the dogsitting house instead of her own.

Apparently she didn't find out what happened until Thursday when she was talking to her friend. She was shown the picture she sent, which was since buried in the group chat. She still insists she has no memory of anything, and freaked out and didn't know what to do. That's why she refused to go to that house with me and why things suddenly got so weird between us. She says she wanted to deny to herself that it happened and didn't want to tell me.

After finding out the truth today, there has been lots of yelling and crying, and I'm currently home by myself.

**My thoughts**

First of all, I do believe she was taken advantage of. She was blackout drunk and the bartender was sober (and significantly older). Her coworkers all confirmed that the bartender told everyone he was dropping her at home, and also that he was feeding her free drinks all night. I also believe she didn't remember it happening at first, because there was a definite mood change on Thursday, which lines up with when she said she found out.

However, I can't help but feel like she was willing even if she was drunk. I'm hurt and it feels like I was cheated on. It's not like the bartender took her home against her will and assaulted her. She figured out the logistics of finding a place to go with him and looked extremely happy in the photo.

Why it still feels like cheating:

* I was told I wasn't invited to the party when everyone else brought their SOs.
* She had access to the dogsitting house a day earlier than I thought.
* She had brought the key to dogsitting house to her work party, even though it was right next to her mom's house.
* The bartender is a guy who had openly flirted with her for weeks.
* She didn't tell me what happened for over a month, and had planned on hiding it forever.

In anger I told her that if this wasn't cheating then she must have been sexually assaulted. And that if we don't press charges then at the very least we need to ensure the bartender loses his job. She cried again and refused to do either. Since she can't remember the night, she isn't willing to report him for anything and can't confirm she didn't want it.

What do you guys think? I'm an emotional mess right now and struggling to be logical. Do I need to put emotion behind me and support her as a victim? Or is she a cheater? Things were great before this and I had hoped to spend my life with this girl.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 1:**

I spoke to her again today and said that there were too many coincidences that make this seem like she planned it out. I told her I needed a bit of time to figure this out but I didn't think I would be able to move past it. I know drawing this out is probably not the best way to handle anything but all logic goes out the window when you're the one involved in a mess like this. However, there are still a few updates worth mentioning.

* We looked at the photo again, and it really looks like **the bartender took the photo!**
* There were only 2 coherent messages she sent after I said goodnight: 1 to the homeowners and 1 along with the photo in the groupchat. She had a few other messages to a non-work friend during this time that are complete nonsense.
* She showed me an earlier message where her friend said the party was staff only.
* She insisted she had never messaged the bartender except within the work group chat. She showed me unaccepted facebook and snapchat invites from him, and said she didn't even have his number. She was willing to let me use a recovery tool to prove they had never messaged but I didn't go through with it.
* She had the key on her keychain since she picked it up from the homeowners (like a week in advance). She is so adamant about this that she was checking photos she took of her odometer hitting 100k to see if her keys were visible, but no proof.
* She said she would be willing to report the bartender to work for sexual harassment, but was still uneasy about pressing charges.
* She still went through with it and hid it from me, so even if her story is completely true somehow, I'm not sure if I can move past it.

**Update 2 is at the top.**",relationship_advice
[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

This is his girlfriend...,"Hey guys just wanted to jump in and give my small bit of say. I am his girlfriend and tonight he met with me to tell me how much of a gold digger I am and gave me the link to this Reddit you all have been talking about me on and said ""That's what everyone thinks of you"". I wish I could describe the pain this has caused me. We only partially discussed finances, and we only see each other about twice a week. We hardly go on any dates, the other night we had top ramen and watched Netflix movies in his room and I was very happy. I make my own money, I pay my own tuition out of pocket, going to have a great career and I consider myself very self sufficient. I am very proud of him for being able to finance (not own) a house. I asked if he would keep it if we were together and married and he said ""yes"". I asked if he would rent it out to offset the expenses of another mortgage we could share 50/50 on together and he became very defensive saying I was trying to make money off his childhood home. I never tried to offend him, and only asked bc I saw a marriage as more of a unison type thing. I already said I would get a prenup with him, so I'm also not sure why he is bringing this up. 

In conclusion, there are always two sides of every story. I am not a monster or a gold digger. We go on very cheap dates  every few weeks ($10-$30) and I've thanked him every time he would offer to pay. I have paid for some. I just wanted to give my say in this. We are no longer together as of tonight. I sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to give an opinion stating that there may be more to the story than he is willing to share. I hope I have a partner who loves me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt, and talk to me in a more positive light. ",relationship_advice
About to end my engagement/five year relationship,"I am about to end my engagement.  I started to seriously doubt things months ago when, after a fight, my fiance said that he was glad we worked things out because I made him so mad that he wanted to choke me.  Since then, I've tried to bring up the statement several times because I felt that it was a threat and extremely hurtful.  During that same fight, he called me a moron because I told him I didn't understand why this specific issue was making him so upset.  Every time I try to have a conversation about it, he says I needed to hear that to know how angry he was.  The fight was about how our dog may think that I'm more dominant than he is because of something I did while playing with the pup.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, my fiance called me and berated me because the car that I bought him has some issues.  Nothing major I think; it probably just needs a tire balance and the bumper fixed.  He had been calling me and berating me about it ever since I bought it for him.  I thought it was a nice car, I just wanted him to have reliable transportation since he worked far away and it put a lot of strain on our finances and relationship.  He demanded an apology for me buying him the car, but when I hesitated he hung up.  He made me so angry, that I sent him a series of nasty texts.  They were true, but I could have been more tactful.  However, I went home halfway through class to do damage control and apologize.

&#x200B;

When I got home, we started to talk.  He told me the things I said were hurtful, and I apologized.  I didn't say much and just tried to listen.  I did the best I could to validate him physically and verbally, but when it was my turn to speak, I told him that he's also said some really hateful things to me (i.e. the choking comment) and never apologized.  I kept it vague, but I confessed it was about him insinuating violence toward after he asked for clarification.  I know it wasn't right to bring up something from the past in a current argument, but it was months ago and I just couldn't stop thinking about it.  When I mentioned that comment, he immediately became enraged.  He covered his ears and started screaming that he was done with the conversation.  I never even got to say all that much.  He started screaming at me to leave, but I stood my ground (I have a dog and a cat and didn't want to leave them with him).  Then, he flipped our bed and broke the frame.  He picked up the frame and tossed it up against the ceiling so that the light fixture from the fan shattered.  He destroyed our room.  I suddenly became clear headed, and called the police.

&#x200B;

He was arrested on simple assault.  He sat in jail for about 48 hours, until his brother bailed him out.  He's home now, and things seem superficially fine.  I tentatively tried to have a conversation about going to couples counseling, but he got angry.  He insisted that he did not want a 3rd person in our relationship, and told me that if I was too afraid to talk to him about our issues outside of a counseling office, then we don't need to be together.  Any time he thinks that I'm afraid of him, or notices that I'm walking on eggshells when talking to him, he gets really volatile.  I do recall asking him to come to pre-marital counseling and/or couples therapy a few times before.  I've flat out told him that I don't mind him having emotions, but I don't like the way he expresses them, and his response is that it's censorship and that if I can't handle him being angry, then I need to leave.  I've left out a lot of other issues with our relationship to prevent this post from becoming too tedious, but there are many.

&#x200B;

I know that I have to leave him, but we have spent five years together and it's so hard.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any advice, encouragement, or even kind words, I am in desperate need now.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: A lot of you have mentioned/asked about me seeing a therapist for 1v1 sessions, and I have been for at least 10 years.  She is helping me with all of this, too.  Also, I picked the car, and he went and looked at it with me.  I advised him that we should take it somewhere to get looked at, or keep looking, but he insisted on that one.  The issues are very minor and probably won't cost more than 300$ to fix overall.",relationship_advice

Shortly after I posted I confronted Cam about everything and that I was depressed and upset with his behavior. 

He said he would start to help out more around the house. He also said he would try to stop ranting about work so much and just be better overall.

I gave him like 2 weeks to get it together. Surprise surprise he didn't change. 

I went to have lunch with an old friend and they asked me how things were going. I broke down and it was a realization moment for me I was wasting my time staying. Cam pushed me to the point where I didn't love him and who he was anymore. I decided enough was enough and I needed to leave. 

While he was at work on a Monday I packed up me and the cats and called my mom. She is my hero. She came with her van and helped me load up as much stuff as possible. She is letting me and the cats stay with her and my dad for a little bit until I find the right apartment. 

I waited for Cam to come home and let him know I was leaving. He didn't take it well. He said he was caught off guard and wasn't expecting me to leave. He said he gave his life to me and that I ruined everything. Immediately after I broke up with him and drove to my parents I felt a sense of relief. 

For the past couple weeks I've been trying to tie up loose ends, like getting the rest of my stuff out and trying to get off the lease. I feel very good about the decision I've made. I'm starting to feel happy again and so are my cats. 

Cam has been a complete jerk, which is to be expected. I'm trying not to get wrapped up in what he has been texting me but it still hurts. He basically accused me of cheating on him. I think it's easier for him to accept that as a reason than me not being in love with him anymore. 

Right now I'm just trying to find a good apartment to move to. I'm excited to live by myself again and be single for a while. I don't think I will be ready to live with anyone again for a while. I have also started to do things that I love again like bike riding and going on hikes with my friends.

I (24F) met my new flatmate (26M) yesterday and we had sex within an hour of meeting. Don't know what to do,"Hi. Please don't judge me!

I'm not the kind of girl that usually does this. I've only slept with 5 people, all relationships. I've never even had a one night stand.

(EDIT: Fuck what I said above, judge me all you like, and yes I am that kind of girl now watcha gone do) 

I live in a 4 bed house, and we had a room spare. Yesterday the new flatmate moved in. I wasn't in when he arrived but when I got back from work, he was in the kitchen making food. The second that I walked in, I don't know how or why or what happened but the sexual tension was just ridiculous. Even just from seeing the back of his head I felt something weird.

We spoke for a few minutes, introduced ourselves etc. But it felt like we were really comfortable with each other already and we were getting along so well. There's no point me going into all the details I am literally just blown away by what happened and I guess typing it is helping me come to terms with it. There's so much sexual tension between us that I want to brag about it haha.

So we started talking about a new tv series and I invited him to watch it in my room, as I'd just put on the next episode. He accepted, and soon were stoned in bed watching tv and then we just made eye contact at like an awkward sex scene and then suddenly we're kissing.

It was crazy, I wasn't even thinking, I wasn't making sense of anything around me, I just wanted to have sex with him. He's sooo ridiculously like my type but extra somehow. I wish I could explain it. Literally if anyone can tell me what sexual tension is scientifically, ELI5, pleaseeee.

Anyway, we had sex for maybe half an hour and then we heard another flatmate come home and my mum called me, so he just went to his room. I saw him a couple hours later going to the bathroom and he just winked at me and said 'can't believe we just did that' and I just said 'yeah crazy...' 

Wtf do I do now

I fancy him so much

The sex was great

But he's my flatmate and it's all awkward and weird 

And I stalked his Instagram and he doesn't upload regularly but it looks like he had a girlfriend pretty recently. I can only assume (well pray) that they are in fact broken up.

Lord how do I survive in this house, is it safe to keep having sex with him? Because I want to... can I just knock on his door and ask if he wants to do it again?


Edit: some of these comments are insane haha. I don't feel bad about it. Do I normally do that kind of thing? No. Am I that kind of girl now? Yeah I guess I am, who cares. You can judge me if you want to :)

Edit 2: I used protection. I'm aware that he may not want to do it again and that we may not be soulmates. That is a-okay, there's no pressure on him. He can do what he wants and so can I. Maybe he does have a girlfriend; I'm not responsible for that, I didn't cheat on anyone, and if I find out he does have a girlfriend, I'll tell her. This event does not define me as a person or make me less of a person. Grow up it's 2019 and people be shaggin",relationship_advice

GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. Thinking about ending things based on her behavior. (X-post r/AITA),"[**UPDATE POST HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqra9h/update_gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/?)

So, my GF and I (both 26) got in a fight about this two nights ago, and she's making it seem like I'm being an asshole. We've been dating for ~4.5 months.

&nbsp; 

My girlfriend has a ~2013 Lenovo laptop that has seen better days. As it stands right now, among some other issues, her keyboard totally doesn't work. Because of this, she always uses a small bluetooth keyboard with her laptop.

&nbsp;

She had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. We had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after I got off work, so I offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as I have a few extras.

&nbsp;

When I got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn't able to use her computer for most of the day. But when I handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. A bit later, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she thought I'd be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard I have at my desk.

&nbsp;

The thing is, I have a really nice keyboard at my desk. I'm a programmer, and I love this keyboard so much that I also bring it to work with me. I even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.

&nbsp; 

For context, I had an extra Amazon Basics keyboard  (~$15) lying around, still brand new in the box. My personal keyboard, which I've had for years, is some variant of the Razer Blackwidow (~$120).

&nbsp; 

Anyway, she was apparently expecting me to be 'selfless' and let her use my nice keyboard while I used the Amazon keyboard. She was upset that I didn't ""value her enough"" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the ""cheap $10 keyboard"" (her words). She said if the situation was reversed, she'd lend me the nice keyboard. I explained to her that I have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because I'm so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if I didn't have it.

 &nbsp;

We continued to argue about it. Things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if I wasn't willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that I ""should have bought her a nice new keyboard if I really cared about her."" This is when I got really mad. I told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that I went out of my way in the first place to grab her the Amazon keyboard. She started crying and asked me to go home. I left, but I still gave her the Amazon keyboard to use. **I was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.**

&nbsp;

So now she's calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard AND because I called her spoiled. We're going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because I refused to continue this silly argument over text.

&nbsp;

I'm thinking about ending things with her, as I feel like this is her showing me her true colors.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: GFs keyboard broke. I lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a 'cheap' keyboard. I called her spoiled, which infuriated her.

&nbsp;

**EDIT:** She texted me asking to meet up tonight instead of tomorrow, as she is feeling anxious and stressed about the situation. **I will give everyone an update later tonight or tomorrow morning.**


&nbsp; 

I also wanted to clarify that she's never acted like this before (although, admittedly, we haven't been together for very long). Some of you suggested that maybe I'm not making her feel 'valued' and this situation is a symptom of that. While I think I both show AND tell her that she's valued in different ways, this may be something I bring up with her. It, of course, doesn't forgive her behavior, but may explain some of it.  Cheers.

After talking some more with my fiancé, we actually decided to postpone our wedding. 
We talked a lot about boundaries and I told him that some things are not ok. He has been single and free his whole life until we met and I imagine it's hard for him to readjust his thoughts about some things. 
We also agreed that we both had issues we should work on before getting married. My issues mainly being my insecurities. 

At first I was really sad, but I actually think this is a very good thing. I had so many negative feelings about the wedding, and now we have the opportunity to fix whats wrong. Maby the next time we try will feel so much more right, and we'll have mostly happy feelings. :) 

Thank you to everyone who commented on the last post! You made me actually take the difficult step to talk about boundaries!

Edit: After a series of very uncomfortable comments and private messages, I will not respond to this post any more. I just hope it can be an example of a relationship in trouble that solves it's issues through communication (and also therapy, in wich we agree to go to)",relationship_advice
"Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out?","Okay so it's essentially the title but I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Names have been changed. 


There are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the Villa, and 2 have an apartment near our Villa. 


1) Harry was going to come. 


2) Harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) Zack was going to come. 


4) Zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 


5) Hank and Mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. They both said Yes. 


6) He asked them both, even though at that time only Zack had cancelled. They both said Yes, so they decided Hank stay in the Villa, and Mark would get an apartment near us as well. 


7) Hank is replacing Zack. At this point we didn't know Harry wasn't coming. 


8) Hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (£240 just for Villa for 1 week). 


9) As we didn't know Harry was going to cancel, Mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 


10) Harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 


11) Without the rest of us knowing Mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since Harry cancelled. 


12) We had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 


13) So, the only thing Mark has paid for is is own flight which is £160. 


14) So, he needs to pay around £240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has.
 

15) The rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""ITS EASIER FOR ME"". 


16) He goes ""I'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that Harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!


17) Also, basically because Harry isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was £250 which means between us we are paying like £35 for the deposit. By doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  


18) If you think about it, if Mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. But he's not, and the deposit that's going to Hank, is covering £250 worth of the shit at the villa. The villa that Mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 


19) So we are literally paying £250 to Mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". We are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 


20) So yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. Do you think that's fair? But we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 


21) If he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 


22) How can we get him to pay? If he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around £35 per person which would be nice too. 


23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to Fuck Off. We know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. He himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

EDIT : Some confusion, we are in Spain right now. It's been 3 of our 7 days. 


What can we do? HOW CAN WE GET HIM TO PAY? 


TL;DR : Friend came last minute. He won't pay for staying in the Villa. What shall we do?",relationship_advice
Thank you guys for giving me the courage to tell my girlfriend.,"TLDR: Told my girlfriend I'm on the spectrum 

Earlier today I posted about if should tell my girlfriend I have autism, originally she never wanted to date someone with autism because her brother had low-functioning autism and it drove her mad, even though she loved him. She has never experienced a high-functioning person with autism until she met me, but when we started dating I was too scared to tell her and even more scared when she said she did not want to date someone on the spectrum. When she got home we had a convo and I told her I was on the spectrum, and she started to cry apologizing for what she said a few weeks back. I told her it was okay, and we hugged. She was happy I told her because then she was able to understand some traits I do and have a different look about autism. Thank you guys for helping me find the courage to tell her! Now I'm sure our relationship will grow stronger! Keep changing peoples lives and making others happy! 

Just wanna add one more thing, my girlfriend had a reason to say what she said. Living with someone with autism depending on the level is very stressful. He is low-functioning, so Imagine having a child/sibling who cry's, breaks things, and you have to keep an eye out for them when in public AT ALL TIMES! she was unaware of the different levels of autism and said she will learn more about it for me and her brother, this is why I love her :)

Edit: Wow! Thank you for the likes, I did not expect this post to go big. I've never been big on likes, but just seeing people being so supportive is all I need! Thank you once again for your support! ❤️",relationship_advice
41M questioning sexuality after making a new friend.,"EDIT: My update post following this was removed, going forward I will be posting any updates directly on my profile, so feel free to follow this account for future updates.  


Throwaway account as I am an avid Redditor. I have been contemplating writing this out because I feel like that action alone could offer me some much needed introspection. I will try not to drag on but I apologize If I do.

I (41M) have always considered myself comfortable with who I have grown to be, I have worked hard in life, have a 4 year degree, a great career, financial stability, loving friends, wonderful family. In many ways I have done well for myself, however, in terms of love, I am missing my mark. I have been single for about 7 years, prior to that I have dated my fair share, never was engaged or married, but I've had long term relationships, weekend flings and everything in between. Following my last relationship I decided to take a break from the dating scene and work on my career goals. So far, it's paid off, jumping 2 promotions in 7 years. I have felt unfulfilled in that department, but I was surprised how easily I could go 7 years without missing dating or companionship. I just simply don't miss it much.

A friend invited me out for beers and darts a few weeks ago. We usually go to the same little pub, where we know most of the normal faces. It's not uncommon for us to mix with the people playing at the board next to us. This night was no different, 2 guys set up on the board next to ours, we made small talk with them here and there, one of the men said his goodbyes and left, the other guy stayed behind and shot darts by himself, we offered him (lets call him James) a place on our board and shot some games of cut throat. things got fun, we drank quite a bit and we were having a lot of fun. My friend said he was ready to take off but James and I were having a good time so we decided to stay a bit longer.

My friend took off, James and I had a couple more rounds, we had quite a bit in common and It felt like I was hanging out with an old friend. He told me he had a rec room with a pool table and dart boards at his house with a built in bar. He showed me a few pictures of the room and I was thoroughly impressed. He suggested we go hangout there and I was on board. Since neither of us drove to the bar, we caught an Uber to his house which was only a few minutes away. We shot a few games of pool and chatted about more personal stuff, our past relationships, careers, college, upbringing, etc. James is a lot like me, never married and a career-minded guy. Things sort of took a turn in conversation when James asked me about my sexuality. He asked if I ever had a phase or experimented. I sort of laughed a bit and said no no, that wasn't something I'd ever done. He made one or two small remarks about it in jest and that was it. About another hour past and I told him I was taking off, we exchanged numbers and agreed to hangout again the following weekend, foregoing the bar and hanging out at his place to cook out on the grill.

I get home, off to bed, I get a text from him asking if I made it home safe, I didn't think too much into it but I did tell him I got home safe. The next day, Sunday. I got up and did my normal Sunday shuffle-off-the-Saturday-night-booze of going  on a jog, hitting my favorite lunch spot and recovering the rest of the day on the couch. About 3p I get a text from James asking If I was interested in coming over around 6p, he was going to grill some fish up and have a couple friends over. I thought that would be fun, so I went. We had another good time, this time I only stayed a couple hours and when I got there he told me his two friends cancelled so it would just be us. It wasn't a huge deal, he was good company. I took off around 9p. He sent me a text about 10 minutes after leaving saying he had fun and is looking forward to the weekend plans we made. I texted him back that I was looking forward to it as well.

The following day James sent me a text telling me about something funny that happened to him at work that morning, I don't keep my phone on me during work so I didn't see it until lunch time. I feel like it's important to note, I don't text people throughout the day, I guess I'm sort of old school but I don't chit chat with people via text often, so to me, James is reaching out more than I'm used to friends doing, but I didn't mind. I looked forward to talking to him. After work I went to the gym per usual and home. I saw someone who kinda looked like him, it made me think of him. On one of the TVs in front of the treadmills they were showing a TV show we talked about, it made me think of him. At the grocery store picking up dinner stuff, I walked past the seafood section and it made me think of him.

We texted throughout the week, I even started keeping my phone at my desk so I could text him. This isn't like me at all. Finally Saturday comes around and plans go off like normal, I actually got to his place a couple hours early. He suggested I invite my friend I was with when we met (well call him Mark), I did and Mark came along with me. We all had a terrific time, James cooked for us, we had plenty to eat and drink, spent time in the pool, shot darts, it was a blast. The end of the night comes around, Mark said he wanted to take off and again, I felt the urge to stay and hangout longer. Which is exactly what I did. This time we sat on his pool deck until 2 am talking about everything you could imagine. I realized the time and had to take off, he understood and instead of shaking hands he hugged me, this is not usual for me whatsoever, but it felt so naturally acceptable, like I WANTED him to do it. I left and this time I texted him from my Uber telling him that I'll let him know when I arrive safely.

That was a week ago, we didn't hangout this past weekend but we've texted daily and made plans to go hiking this coming Saturday. I thought about the way I feel about him and I've concluded it's the same way you feel when you meet someone who you fall in love with. Coupling that with his questioning me if I've ever fooled around with guys or had an 'experimental phase' kind of makes me think he feels the way I do and he may be gay or at least bi-sexual. I'm torn as far as what to do, because I love this feeling and I think I'm falling in love with this guy. It feels so strange to type that out but I think it's true. He is definitely flirting with me and I have decided I am definitely flirting back with him. Should I have a talk with him directly about this? Should I make a move on him? What if I do and it feels wrong? I have so many questions and I don't even know where to begin. Has anybody had this sort of thing happen? Is the reason I had no qualms with being single for so long because I lost interest in women subconsciously?  I have never outwardly been attracted to guys, but this isn't an attraction to a person physicality, this is deeper than that, which is why it's really screwing with me. Sorry I rambled a lot, but just typing this has been therapeutic. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Straight-identifying guy makes new friend at a bar, talks to him everyday, conflicted if I'm falling in love with him.",relationship_advice
My friend [F19] invited me [M19] to play golf and had her boyfriend control a vibrator inside of her,"This happened yesterday. To give a bit of background, I work at a golf course and a girl I had known for years but never been friends with started working at the course. We ended up becoming really good friends and we both looked forwards to shifts together.

The other day she invited me out to play golf with her and another girl from work. I thought it sounded fun so I said yes. The day of, the plan changed and she was now bringing her boyfriend and the other girl was bringing a friend. The course only allows groups of four to go out so she told me to come with her and her boyfriend. I thought that would be fine, but going into it I was hoping this wouldn't be a third wheel situation.

  


We got to the first tee box after stocking up on drinks and immediately I noticed her boyfriend had a sleek black remote in his hand. When she got up to use her driver, she was clutching her groin and telling her boyfriend to stop while she was driving as her boyfriend was laughing. I think I caught on almost immediately as I knew she is a very sexual person, and I know remote control vibrators exist. I was in disbelief and kept playing. This continued to happen for about 8 holes of golf until by the 9th she claimed to have turned it off. It was almost constant throughout the whole round, with them discussing different levels and stuff on the remote. The whole thing was done right in front of me and very obviously, I pretended I didn't know what was going on as it was incredibly uncomfortable. Luckily by the 9th hole we had ran out of balls and had to call it. They drove me home and I left the car thinking that was one of the weirdest, most inconsiderate things someone has done to/around me.

  


Flashforward to today when I'm at work till 3 and she started at 1. It was at work that I realized how fucked up the whole situation was, and how she thought that it would okay to do that around me. When she showed up to work I was pretty cold, only really saying the bare minimum, whereas normally we would be talking a whole lot. After a bit, she asked me if something was wrong. She was was asking if something happened this morning or today, as if she thought I hadn't picked up on what had happened. I told her that golfing with her and her boyfriend was really weird. She asked what happened, and I told her ""I'm pretty sure you know what happened"". She still didn't fill in the blanks, until I mentioned the remote. At which point she said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable, I don't I don't know why I agreed to that, I don't know what else to say"". I asked her why she would tell me to golf with her boyfriend and her if she planned on doing that, and she didn't have an answer for me. After a few minutes of that I had enough and left to do a different task away from her.

  


I really don't know if there's going to be any recovering from this as honestly I'm kinda shocked by the lack of respect and her choice to do that in front of me. I really enjoyed being friends with her prior to this and nothing similar ever happened, but I'm truly shocked and kind of disgusted by her actions.

  


I'm curious to hear if people think I'm overreacting, or I'm in the right. Thanks for hearing me out.

**Edit:** I appreciate all the responses, there have been some really worthwhile ones. I also see a lot of assumptions being made that aren't accurate as these things often go. Lastly I got a text from the girl saying she would better explain herself when she gets off work (about 2 hours from the time of this edit). I'll keep you guys updated.

**Edit 2:** I hadn't talked to her since the confrontation at work, and I left it at that to see if she would attempt to make amends over text as I really saw no reason trying to maintain a friendship if she didn't reach out. I'll copy paste the message I was sent by her:


Hey (my name), 
I just wanted to apologize again. You are right to feel the way you do. What we did was completely inappropriate and unfair. We thought it would be harmless fun but it definitely wasn't. I never meant to make you feel uncomfortable like that and put u in that position. I really value you as a friend and I would never do anything intentionally to jeopardize our friendship. I'm embarrassed and ashamed of our actions and I hope in your own time u can forgive me. U have my word nothing like that will EVER happen again. I'm so sorry again (my name)!
 
I responded by saying I appreciated her apology and it might be possible to get past this. But I told her I couldn't understand her motive in all of this, either way it seemed like a total lack of respect and consideration for me in the whole affair.

We'll see where this goes.

**Edit 3:** I just woke up. She's currently at work, and I never got a response to what I had sent her about my concerns. Tomorrow we are closing the golf course alone just the two of us, so I'm feeling like there will a resolution for the better or worst. Right now I'm not sure what that will be. I'll probably get a response later today, as it's really not like her to ignore one of my messages. Reading a lot of these comments, I'm realizing I didn't give enough context about our friendship. We became quite good friends after beggining to work together this summer, we both looked forward to shifts together as conversations flowed very easily and we could make each other laugh. We started hanging out quite often after work. Through our conversations, some very sexual things came up, but it was mostly either of us just recollecting experiences in the past. When I first met her I thought I met pursue her as we got along well, but I quickly found out she had a boyfriend and I left it at that. I never had any intentions of getting with the girl, or interfering with her relationship in any way, she seemed happy with her boyfriend and I respected that. I valued our friendship, and enjoyed working with her. If there were no motives behind this, then perhaps we can go back to being friends, as it really did make time pass when we were working together.",relationship_advice
I just found found out my husband (32m) cheated on me (27f) at his bachelor party,"Using throwaway account. We are newlyweds been married less than a month. We lived together for 3 years before we got married and we dated for 4 years before he proposed. I've never had trust issues with him before, we even did long distance for a year when he had to travel for work and it worked out great. 

For his bachelor party half of his groomsmen were also engaged so they had a big blowout bachelor party trip in mexico. I was weary of letting him  go because I know his single friends party hard, they travel just to party with hookers and strippers on yachts. I've heard all their wild party stories. But he assured me there's no way anything will happen because there was only 2 single guys on the trip and none of his friends have ever cheated before. I'm not an insecure person because I'm confident young and attractive so i let him go. Even though there would have been a lot of temptation to cheat I trusted him. 

When he came back from his trip I asked him if anything happened, he said no everyone behaved, especially him! I asked his best man if he had anything to tell me before we tied the knot and he said my fiancée adores me and would never cheat on me. We got married as planned. Fast forward to today, a month after we got married. He left his phone on the couch where we were sitting, he left the room to take a shower. His phone is lighting up with texts from his best friend. Talking about the bachelor party. They wanted to go back to the same country that the bachelor party was at for his friend's birthday and were talking about a girl. 

I know his phone password so i opened up his phone and read ALL the text messages with his friend. Basically his scumbag best friend was bragging to my fiancée that he covered for him so well there's no way I'll ever find out about him cheating before our wedding. My fiancée thanked him and said that the bachelors need to go over their stories so that they all match. I found videos of my husbands friends cheating getting oral from hookers on a yacht. I found photos of my husband kissing a girl on his lap in a bikini which i'm guessing is the one of the prostitutes he was using on his trip. Basically every single guy on the trip had sex with prostitutes which means now not only is my marriage affected but I don't know if it's my responsibility to break 3 women's hearts whose husbands or fiancées were also on the bachelor trip. The things I found is going to break up the homes of all his closest friends and I don't even know if I should tell them or not. I screenshotted everything and sent it to myself. 

I don't know what to do because I don't want our marriage to end over this. Honestly I was willing to instantly forgive him if he owned up and apologized immediately after he came home. But the fact that he lied upsets me more than the cheating, is that weird? I don't know if he feels any guilt. I am especially seeking advice from people who stayed in a relationship after discovering infidelity. Is it possible to heal something like this or are we doomed for divorce? This is the first time I've ever been cheated on ever and I don't why I feel like I should be angry but i'm not - is there something wrong with me?",relationship_advice
My parents are cock-blocking me,"Bit of a backstory: my SO and I have been together 11 years, married for 1.5 years. We've had a normal sex life with ups and downs, are always open communication wise about sex and our wants/needs. It's always been a healthy relationship that we consciously work on. 

3 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and asked us to move back home to help out with the day to day and have also been helping financially. We both have low earning professions, and have been doing our best to be helpful. Most days, we are pretty tired by the end of the night, once everything is done and my parents are asleep. My mom has also made a comment about how she expects us to find another place to have sex. She has suggested getting hotel rooms or having sex in my car. We don't make enough to pay for hotel stays, and it's illegal to do it in a car where I'm from. To top it off my husband has said he doesn't feel comfortable in my parents home.  We've had sex once since moving in a month and a half ago. And it wasn't good sex. It was awkward. 
I know that sex isn't everything in a relationship, but as I've said to my husband, I feel like I have become more of a best friend than a wife. I'm not really sure what to do to make my husband feel more comfortable, or where to have sex without running the risk of getting arrested.


EDIT: thanks for the feedback, I was asked about my cultural background, I'm from a middle eastern family, where respecting your parents is kinda huge. 
Also we weren't 10 when we met, I'm 32 now. 
Does anyone have any tips on shower sex? Even though my bod is wet, there's no lubrication down there so it never works out. I also have the squeakiest bed which accounted for a lot of the awkwardness. And pumping music and tv will wake my father up(remember he has cancer and needs to rest)
Moving out is a great idea but rent in our city is ridiculous and would take months to save for since I'm giving my parents a lot of our income. I'm also trying to save for school so I can have a better lot in life. After all that I'm basically broke, so even air b&b is difficult.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My (23f) bf (23m) hasn't been there for me through a family emergency. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I should just call it.

Hi everyone

It's been several days since my post, and I really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who gave me their opinions and offered condolences. I appreciate your time and thoughts so much. Plus, reading through this thread was a great distraction and it helped me keep it together for my family when I was with with them... especially the snarky replies lol.

It has felt like a long week but I finally feel like I'm over the hurdle. Yesterday was the funeral, where my family asked me to speak. My cousins couldn't. The funeral was packed, and the overflow room in the funeral home was filled with people who loved my uncle.

My sisters fiancé and my brothers girlfriend both came to support our family. I think that was one thing that really drove home the conclusions I came to earlier in the week. 

Through this whole week, my bf has not once asked how I feel or if I'm okay. My friends, coworkers, and acquaintances who knew my uncle have shown me more compassion.

I don't hate him, but he really took me down.

At first I was going to take the advice many people gave and just ghost him. It seemed like the easiest thing to do. I even deleted all of my events from our shared google calendar, and left group chats that we were both in. I blocked him on fb messenger but that only lasted like an hour before I realized that I'm not that person. Even though I was hurt and angry, I don't need to get even. 

On Thursday (the night before the visitation), I cracked and texted him asking him to just talk to me and explain what was happening, and then I went to sleep.

Part of me didn't think he'd respond, but in the morning he had sent me a long message explaining his perspective. 

He basically explained he doesn't handle grief or loss well due to past experiences (I understand), but then accused me of being like his ex-girlfriend and he can't go back to that and how I have to communicate.

I know I'm not winning any awards for communication. I'm afraid to speak my mind sometimes and that leads me to be passive aggressive or with festering issues. But how can I communicate with someone who doesn't respond to me or ask questions? I don't think he realizes it's a two way street.

We had a previous conversation where I explained to him that it was hard for me to express myself because of past trauma, and that I would try to improve but I would need him to be patient and call me out and ask me questions. This is what frustrated me the most.

I responded with a long message saying that I understand I reacted badly, but then explained my side and told him that his actions were hurtful especially because I really needed him and he rejected me. I needed support and he ignored me instead for being too emotional.

He said sorry, and asked if we can make up. I told him I don't know and that I couldn't think about it with everything else going on, so we're supposed to talk later this week.

The thing is, even though I understand his reaction a little better, it's not something I can accept or live with. As a lot of you pointed out, our communication styles are just too incompatible. I was willing to work towards bridging it, maybe because I didn't know where my line was. I definitely found the line this week.

Even his apology didn't show any concern for my well being. I know some of you pointed out it's a young relationship, but I think generic condolences are not a lot to ask for from a partner - especially as we knew each other as friends before. 

He took my pain this week and made it about himself, and then waited for me to make it better for him. If I hadn't messaged him Thursday, I truly doubt I would have heard from him at all. That kind of selfishness is not something I want in a friend or a partner.

So, whenever I get around to it, we're going to have to have that conversation. I'm pretty anxious about it and still sad, but I'm not willing to keep trying. If I did, I'd feel like I was selling myself out. 

If you read this far, thank you. I wasn't going to post this update because I felt self absorbed talking about myself like this. But I had a few private messages this week asking about what happened, so this seemed easiest.",relationship_advice
I think I've fallen in love with my girlfriend? I need some advice.,"So full disclaimer: I'm 29, and I don't think I've ever been in love before.

I've been dating my girlfriend for the past 4 months or so. The first month or 2 I knew her, she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship due to bad break ups, so we had a bit of a rocky start where neither of us were sure where we were going, or what we were doing. But we continued to hang out, have fun together, until one day she asked me if it would be alright if she started calling me her boyfriend.

Fast forward to today - Despite our busy schedules we still manage to see each other every other day. I've met almost all her friends, and some of which I consider my friends now as well! I get along with her whole group, and she gets along great with my friends. We have many overlapping interests and activities which makes things amazingly fun when we get together. She spends the night frequently. I've met her parents and family, she has met mine. We both cheesily admitted we wished we could see each other every day.

The other day I was running my hands through her hair while we were falling asleep, just admiring everything about her. When suddenly, a realization dawned on me: ""I think I love her"".

The problem is, I've never experienced ""love"", I'm not sure what it is, or what it's supposed to feel like if that makes any sense? What I do know is I've never felt like this about any girl before. I never get tired of her - her corny jokes, her silly laugh, her competitive drive. Even her ""faults"" or ""negative"" traits I find endearing. I want to see her always, and I think about her a lot. Is this love?

I haven't said anything yet to her for 2 reasons.

1.) I want to be absolutely certain I love her before I say anything.

2.) It might be too soon to say it? 4 months is not a long time - and she has a history of bad Ex's that ended horribly, which made her slow to open up in the first place. For her to ask me if it's okay if she calls me her boyfriend was a big thing for her, so I imagine something like love is probably something even more difficult.

Am I in love? And if I am, should I say anything?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Wow this blew up... There's so much advice in here, and I don't have time to read through it all right now, but I wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to drop a few words of wisdom my way. I really appreciate it! I think for right now, it seems like waiting for the time being is the best. And to echo as others have said, I think I'll show it, rather than speak it. I don't want to put undue pressure on us, or her, and I'd like her to be absolutely comfortable.

First of all, thank you to everyone that responded to my original post. I tend to be very oblivious to people hitting on me and seeing Reddit mostly in agreement helped convince myself I wasn't completely crazy.

Now onto the important part: Reddit was right- it was a Netflix and chill situation. Thankfully he messaged me a few hours before we were due to meet up and made it extremely clear that he was interested in me. I truly appreciated him making his intentions known and it set the tone for our night- no awkward ""is he going to make a move?"" to worry about. I'm not going to go into details but I thoroughly enjoyed our time together and can't wait to see him again. :) 

TLDR: Reddit was right. DM;HS.

Update - my ex boyfriend sent nudes of me to his friends,"I first wanna say that I did not mean for this to get so out of hand with all the comments and upvotes I was mostly venting and scared and I didn't think it was gonna gain so much traction 

Secondly my parents and I are in contact with a lawyer, we're talking things through and I really hope something happens. My number one wish would be for him to be castrated with a hot knife but unfortunately that's not likely

I don't think it's appropriate for me to give updates on this, especially with how popular that post got, I just don't feel comfortable putting my business out there like that with so many people waiting on it. Really did not expect that to happen... but thanks for all the sweet wishes and nice comments, some of you guys are so nice. I was really freaked out yesterday but you know what, it's a new day, I'm alive and healthy, it's not the end of the world, I'm okay, things are gonna work out and my lawyer's saying good things. I just wanted to let you know since I won't be making any comments or posts on this anymore. This is it, wish me luck 🤞",relationship_advice
"After his father died, BF(30m) revealed a devastating secret to me (25).","My boyfriend (30m) and I (25f) have been dating for 4 years, we met in school (I was in college; he was in grad school). We had a very loving and affectionate relationship, and there were no secrets between us...or so I thought. 

&#x200B;

When BF's father unexpectedly passed away from a heart attack a few weeks ago, I was there for BF as he and his mother coped (cooking, cleaning, etc, all the stuff they couldn't do as they grieved), I held BF as he cried, and attended the wake and service.

&#x200B;

When everything was over, BF told me he wanted to get married but he had to tell me the secret he was keeping, since he did not want to go into marriage with any secrets. The secret may seem small to some, but it was huge and devastating to me. 

&#x200B;

For the entire course of our four year relationship, my BF was meeting up with his ex-girlfriend once a month (or more--I have no way of knowing). He claims it was completely platonic, and they only met as friends, and he sees her a sister. 

But even if that is true (it might be or it might not be, I have no way to contact her and find out), he still hid this from me our entire relationship, so I feel like it is cheating, even if it wasn't physical cheating. 

&#x200B;

He admits that he was wrong, and tearfully apologized. I told him I could not forgive him and this was an extreme betrayal regardless if he cheated physically or just emotionally, and that it wasn't just being friends with his ex but hiding it. He promised not to do it again, and to make it up to me somehow, but I honestly have no idea how that is possible since nothing can erase the four years of lying. 

&#x200B;

As of that conversation, we haven't met up in person yet. But I do have stuff at his house and he has stuff at mine, so whether we breakup or stay together, I do have to face him again. 

&#x200B;

So what should I do? I know the easy answer is breakup. But this is the person I love more than anyone, the one I planned to spend my entire life with, and a grieving human being who just lost his father suddenly, at an early age.

&#x200B;

I truly love him and see that he is sorry, but I don't think I can ever forgive him. Still, he is already really messed up due to his father dying and completely cutting him off might destroy him. Even if I don't want to be with him anymore, I still want to be there for him after the loss of his father. But I am so heartbroken that I can barely get through the day without crying and having panic attacks.

&#x200B;

What do I do?

Update: I (F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(60s) and suddenly he wants back in,"I just posted here yesterday but it feels like weeks have happened.

So I have just left my daughter with my mother and am going to my lawyer again.

I followed some advice you guys gave me and we sat down with my daughter to ""chit chat"".

We knew we couldn't promt any kind of responses my asking overly spesific questions as per her therapist.

So my mother asks my daughter (Lets call her Cat)

""cat what do you and daddy talk about?""

And cat just listed many toddler things like she talks about kindergarten, games etc. When I was kind of relieved that that comment my ex made yesterday may just be a one of, came the big bomb.

""he also shows me pictures of houses and tells me I can have now 2 rooms with loads of stuff!!""

I ask if her dad is buying a new house.

Nope. Turns out that nut wants to take my daughter out of the country. He shows her pictures of beach houses and even bought her allready a bag so she can put her stuff inside it. Wich explains why so many of her clothes have gone missing.

At first I thought that my ex maybe hadn't told me yet because it hadn't come trough. But no he told my daughter to keep this as a secret because momy would get sad if she knew that daddy was going away.

So I am fucking livid. And also sad because I will have to tell my daughter no. Once again I feel lost.

Edit /Update : I talked to my lawyer and we have taken measures that I can't discuss here but we are on it.

I have my daughters passport as we flew last month to visit extended family.

Also I am a US citizen so even if my ex MIL tired to have me deported, that wouldn't be possible",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"Last post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu9h99/i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft_strapon/

A lot went down in the last few hours. Less dick jokes this time round, because now I'm over the ""surprise floppy dong!"" aspect of it, it's turned out a lot more serious than I expected.

(for what it's worth, my girlfriend told me to still call her ""she"" at all times except when dressing male, so I'm still going with that for this update post)

I fell asleep not long after the post I made last night. Got up around 2. Headed downstairs to get my 2pm ""breakfast"", and GF was down there in her pyjamas, with a cup of tea and her phone. Good a time as any to address the elephant in the room, I thought.

It was awkward as hell. I started off with ""hey"", got a dead silence, and followed it up with something like ""sorry, I was looking for my uniform shirt yesterday, but that drawer's really none of my business, you can keep whatever you want in there, it's all good"".

Tried to keep it as non-specific as I could. If she didn't know I'd found it before, she definitely knew now.

She just sort of nodded in response to me. Then she apologised for not being in a talkative mood last night, and started telling me about her day. But it came off really strained. I could tell it was on her mind, and she kinda trailed off after a bit.

Eventually she told me to come upstairs with her. I thought she just wanted to talk somewhere more private (it's a shared kitchen, we're living in a family's spare room). But no, she went into our room and showed me everything.

She crossdresses. That's specifically how she referred to it, not trans or drag king or anything. She wears the dick (the packer, as the comments informed me last night), and the crop top she'd had it wrapped in flattens down her boobs. And it turns out she's been going through my drawers for a lot longer than I've been going through hers, because she got a shirt and some comfy tracksuit pants from my drawers and put them on. She has long hair, so she ties it up and hides it under a flat cap that she had in another drawer.

After she'd shown me all of this, basically in silence, she looked at herself in her mirror for a bit. Different angles and stuff. To me she still basically looked like herself, with a flatter chest and different clothes, but she seemed fascinated with how she looked now.

She kept glancing over at me to see my approval, and I smiled back. Tried to look as reassuring as possible. I noticed she'd been pretty shaky putting things on. When she was looking at herself in the mirror, I went over and put a hand on her shoulder supportively, which basically seemed like it was what pushed her over into starting to cry.

Then she broke the silence and just couldn't stop talking. She's been crossdressing secretly for the past couple of months, she was so worried about what I'd think. She insists she's not transgender, she just likes to crossdress sometimes, it makes her feel good and confident. Also insists it's not a sex thing. Just for fun.

I kept saying ""it's okay, it's okay, don't worry"", mostly because I didn't really know what to say. I ended up hugging her as she sobbed on the bed. She calmed down eventually, and told me ""thank you"", because she said she had no idea how I'd react.

She asked me how she looked (while still all red-eyed from crying). I just said ""you look great"" and smiled, and she hugged me again. ""You don't mind me wearing your clothes?"" ""Yeah, no worries!"" I guess she was always a lot more careful with my stuff than I was with hers in my rush yesterday. We didn't really talk much about it, I just asked a few simple questions like if she wanted me to refer to her with different pronouns when she was dressed like this (I know that's usually a trans thing but I thought I'd check anyway).

We didn't do much else after that. She eventually got on her phone again, I got on my laptop. The two of us hanging out together doing our own thing, just as we usually do, only with her in different clothes. I basically got my mind off it for a bit, and then I had to go to work again not long later. Wrote most of this on the bus to work.

I've been thinking back to when I said she looked great. She basically just looked like herself still. A few different clothing choices didn't transform her into a different person for me, and they definitely didn't transform her into a man. It was basically just the same as she always is, for me. But I realise it was a lot more significant for her, and I respect that. But also I don't want to pretend it's a mindblowing shift in appearance for me, too.

Also I was thinking... I think I'm glad she's not trans. Is that bad of me to say? I love and respect her but I realised when thinking about it last night, if I ever did see her as a man, things would be really different for me. I know I was going on about pegging in the last post, but ""girl with strapon"" and ""someone who straight-up looks like a man"" are really two different things for me, and I don't think I really have the wiring to have feelings for her as a man. But I'd do my best to be supportive anyway, because I don't want to stop her being the person she is. I'm really hoping the situation stays where it is and never comes between us. If it did... I'd have to let go of her as a girlfriend. Let her find somebody right for her.

TL;DR: I don't have a problem with her crossdressing, but mainly because she still just looks like a woman to me and I barely even register it as crossdressing. Should I tell her this? I think she'd take it badly after the emotional moments earlier.

I have to go into work now, so I won't be responding for a bit. Thank you for everyone who's offered support, in public or private.",relationship_advice
My [31F] boyfriend [34M] broke up with me sort of because I asked if I was invited to his sister's wedding,"So, this might be a long read. I am not using a throwaway because I don't care.

My boyfriend and I have had an interesting relationship. I would say the main thing that has divided us has been that his family is kinda racist Southerners and I am a mixed race person. He assured me that this wouldn't be an issue when I met his family. Hint: it was.

I'm not going to go into detail about the way they treated me, specifically his mother and sister, but it was not pleasant. His sister and I had met previously and I thought we were cool - until I met his mother. His mother and sister ganged up on me and were very mean with that uniquely acquired Southern Charm (y'all from the South know exactly what I am talking about). Basically I ended up getting wasted and telling them they were extremely rude and said something along the lines of, ""Y'all want to be Southern Belles, but you're disguised White Trash."" Umm... oops. I was so drunk that night that they called the police and I ended up in the hospital to sober up. Go me. Definitely not my proudest moment.

Anyway, fast forward to a year later, his sister is getting married. His sister and I are cool again like when we first met. K. I asked my boyfriend last night if I was invited to the wedding. He said no because of the way I treated his family. I said, ""Wait, you mean because of the way your family treated me?"" And this escalated into an argument about how I disrespected his family and he refuses to understand that I don't exactly appreciate being talked down to by his family. He then said, ""Let's face it, you were never going to be invited to the wedding in the first place. Our relationship was never going to be a long-term thing."" Okay, well, there's a lot to unpack there, including when I helped his sister pick out wedding dresses and we talked about cakes and stuff like that. Maybe she was just being polite.

But... we have also been together for more than a year and a half and live in a house (that he owns) together? There was a little bit more to this. He said, ""We have a great partnership. You're really good at cooking and cleaning and taking care of the house..."" Okay, what. I didn't realize that I was your housemaid (to save our viewers from the words that I am really thinking).

Then, this morning, he's acting like nothing ever happened. 

I don't know. There is probably a lot that needs clarification. But I guess I will answer those questions if they are ever asked.

UPDATE: My (21m) best friend (20f) found out that I have self harm scars and has told our entire friendship group (19-21). They are now excluding me from almost everything.,"[you can find my original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csy8ds/my_21m_best_friend_20f_found_out_that_i_have_self/)

I know since the internet doesn't like to be left hanging, so I thought I'd give you guys the update on my situation. It's sadly not the happy ending that I was hoping for.

After I read all the advice on my original post, and responded to PMs and answered questions, I decided I'd message each friend individually to ask if the general consensus of the group was really what Allie said it was (with everyone being uncomfortable, and preferring that I didn't come to the beach).

Through doing this, I sadly found out that Allie was telling the truth. Every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, I never said I'd go to the beach), and they'd rather I didn't come.

I told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset I was that I was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that I didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt I felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you want me to do about that.""

As for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. One of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion

So in conclusion, I lost 9 friends, I feel like shit, and I don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this.

Have a wonderful day, wherever you are.

"I [25]f urgently called my colleague [28]m about a disaster with our current work after he had left for the day, and now I have to speak to his girlfriend, and also send her photos of all emails between us","My colleague and I have been working on a super important/confidential project this week, I work until 6pm and he works until 3pm. 

At 5pm, I realised 70% of our cases had disappeared. Because of the seriousness of this information, we could be instantly dismissed if it got into the wrong hands. In a panic, I called him (for the first time ever in 6 months, might I add) while scrambling bits of paper and instantly shouted down the phone ""MATE IVE LOST THE CASES"". Luckily, although he sent me on a wild goose chase, he remembered he had put them in his locked cabinet for tomorrow. The phone call was ended with a thanks, the phone call lasted 55 seconds. 

About half an hour later, I was bombarded with phone calls from him. I ran out of the office in a panic and picked up, where he explained that I called him about the cases at a really really bad time. A bit confused, I apologised for calling him out of hours but it was seriously urgent. 

He went onto explain that his girlfriend had since become extremely angry and accused him of having an affair with me. With his voice trembling, he said to me that I needed to speak to his girlfriend on the phone to explain who I am and why I needed to contact him, and also all evidence of emails back and forth for the last six months. I kind of laughed in disbelief and said don't be so ridiculous, then he went completely silent and said ""you have to do this for me. Please."" Instantly I went a bit cold, because I've never heard a mans voice tremble like that. 

I agreed to do whatever would make the situation better for him and asked if he felt like he was in danger. He hesitated, but then said ""I don't know what else to do, she's really kicking off at me. Please don't tell anyone about this"". I suggested to take himself away from the situation if he can and to contact a family member, friend or even the police if it felt necessary. I'm still waiting on contact from his girlfriend, but learning from personal experience of domestic abuse she will not contact me, only emotionally manipulate him into feeling like he did something wrong. 

He is a really relaxed, happy guy at work so to hear him frightened and manic has made me extremely concerned. 

What do I say when she calls? Do I send her every single email for the last six months? Do I try to talk to him tomorrow at work about it? Do I stay away from his personal situation and mind my own business?

My wife f(31) sent me m(30) a snap chat with a filter that had her in mascara and dark lipstick.,"Her text on the snap was a sarcastic ""Pretty lol"" but to be quite honest she was drop dead gorgeous.  

  

Now on the surface that sounds wholesome and there doesnt seem to be anything that advice is needed for right?  

  

Well my wife almost never wears makeup. No powder, no mascara, not even eye liner or lipstick.  Pretty much the only thing that goes on her face is chapstick.  

  

She has all of these things and will put on eye liner on our ""date nights"" or a fancy get together but that is pretty much it.   

  

We have been happily married for going on 7 years and I have never had a problem with no makeup. She is as beautiful to me today as ever.  

  

But that snap she sent just did something for me. I dont know if it was the dark lipstick (I was a goth kid in highschool), or if it was just makeup in general but fuck if she didnt look the hottest I have ever seen her minus our wedding night.  

  

So the thing I need advice for: How do I tell her this? Do I tell her this? If I tell her this how can I do it in a way that doesnt scream I am an asshole that thinks she is only pretty cause she put make up on?   

  

I want to see her in make up like full on like the snap. Not all day everyday. maybe just like on our datenights. Or even just once a year.   

  

I dont know I feel selfish and assholeish just typing this up. Any help is appreciated.",relationship_advice
"Update - I posted a bunch of creepy texts guys have sent me, onto Facebook and Instagram.","This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqz2h/i_25f_posted_a_bunch_of_creepy_texts_guys_have/

 To recap my last submission, I posted an album of creepy texts I'd recieved from men in my field (computer engineering). Some from classmates and a TA in college, some from people I met through internships and professional development activities, and some I know through my current job. I had been so fed up with the sense of shame and being silenced and not believed, about sexual harassment. And, for what it's worth, putting a large collection of harassing and threatening texts in the public eye, raw and unedited, made them difficult to ignore or explain away. After that post, I got a meeting invitation from my company's HR department, for this Monday.

A lot happened over the weekend. I did a lot of research into employment law, I read through the whole company handbook again, and for each person I mentioned in my social media posts, I wrote out up a detailed account of their behavior towards me for my own reference, stuff that had not been said over text.

I also screenshot and backed up any angry or threatening texts towards me, that I received this weekend from the men whose old texts I'd posted online.

----

I think its worth giving some background on the four people included in my social media posts that I knew from my current job.

(Coworker 1) A few months ago, I had reported him to HR for sexual harassment in the past, and he was moved off my team to another position in the company where he would not have any contact with me. He had signed a paper saying that he must not contact me for any reason, whether that is work related or not. I didn't sign anything during this process.

The messages from him that I posted on Facebook were old texts from him, to my personal phone. Making a comment about how I looked nice at work, and how I must have been dressing up for him. I'd replied that I was not. He asked me who I was dressing up for at work, if not him. Because then he'd know who to be jealous of. I said 'myself' and told him to stop texting me on my personal phone. A few days later, he sent me a message telling me my new hair color was ""hot"" and asking me to drinks. That was a small snippet of creepy things he'd sent me, there was plenty more that I didn't post.

I found out today that he was the one who showed HR my posts, as I understand it, he had assumed I had signed a similar no-contact agreement that he'd had to. I had not ever made that agreement, in writing or vocally. I'd just not been talking to him because I had no desire to.

(Coworker 2) He was married, and in the office, he didn't seem to do anything out of line. He had my number since I would be traveling for work and wanted my team members to be able to contact me. (We don't have work cell phones) 

Out of the blue, he texted me asking me to join him at a fancy seafood restaurant when I returned from my work trip. It sounded like a date. I texted back ""uh you're married"" and he said some shit about how nobody would have to know, and how I seemed like a girl who could keep a secret. I told him to fuck off. 

He was fired a week later for unrelated reasons, so while I'd been thinking about going to HR, I never did. I haven't heard from him since, even after my social media post.

(Coworker 3) He was also married. One time I was at a work happy hour and I left pretty early. He texted me on my work instant messaging platform, which I have on my phone, asking me to go party with him. I asked ""Is your wife coming"" and didn't get a response. I didn't think it was bad enough to report to HR as sexual harassment, because something usually has to be done repeatedly to qualify as harassment, unless it is something egregious. (That was in the company handbook, in less concise words) 

That text exchange was included in my post.

After my post, he sent me a slew of threatening texts. Apparently his wife had seen the post, and I had ""ruined his family"". He said that I was about to ""get what was coming 4 me real soon"", and to ""watch out"" which sounded like a threat. Also called me a couple homophobic slurs. (I'm openly bisexual)

(Coworker 4) He had just broken off an engagement. I didn't hear that from him, just through the rumor mill. He contacted me asking me if I wanted to go out, and I said that he wasn't really my type to date. He said that he wasn't looking for anything serious, just casual sex. I didn't reply for a few hours and then he sent me a second text saying ""Well then go ahead and be a bitch and leave me on read""

Since it happened outside of work, and was not any kind or repeated harassment, I also didn't think that it would be reasonable to bring it to HR unless I saw a pattern of similar behavior. He didn't contact me again, even after my post.

------

As for people from past jobs, internships, or classes...

My college contacted me about my old TA who had tried to hook up with me repeatedly, and stopped helping me with the course when it was clear he wasn't getting anywhere. They asked me if I'd give a statement. Apparently he was still doing that shit, and someone else had reported him. And they saw from my post that I'd likely have something to report too.

A married guy who tried to get with me when I was an intern at another company sent me some really angry and threatening texts, I have to figure my instagram post (with his public Instagram account tagged) caused problems in his marriage. I definitely have been taking extra steps to stay safe when I'm leaving my apartment or going anywhere. I'm considering reporting this to the police because it was the most overtly threatening thing I've received.

A few other people I tagged sent me texts telling me how shitty it was not to keep private conversations private, etc. I ignored all those.

-----

As for what happened this morning, in my HR meeting... I was all ready to go in with (metaphorical) guns blazing, defend everything I'd said or done with sources from the company handbook.

Such as how I did not violate the company social media policy, as it only prohibited pretending to speak for the company as a whole if PR is not your job, or reveal confidential code or design or business contracts online. (I didn't mention my company in my post, or anywhere else on my social media)

I was also ready to defend how I followed the guidelines of what is considered sexual harassment and should be reported. How I reported repeated harassment, but didn't report isolated incidents that were not extreme. (The examples of extreme conduct included unwanted overtly sexual touching, or threats of violence. The handbook specifically mentioned that asking someone out once was not harassment)

But the meeting ended up being much more low-key than I had been expecting.

I'd taken down both posts Sunday, as an act of good faith, though I doubted that would matter much.

When I went in, I sat down and asked if I could record the meeting. The HR representative (I'll call her Beth here but that's not her real name of course) said Ok. She wanted to talk about each of the specific people I'd posted screenshots from, who work at the company. (Those made up less than a third of my screenshots FYI)

First was Coworker 1. The guy I had previously reported to HR and who had been moved to a different team and told that he must not speak to me or contact me. Beth said that he had brought the posts to her attention, as he was under the impression that the ""no contact"" agreement went both ways. I reminded her that I had not entered into a written or verbal agreement. I was surprised it was him who brought it up, but I didn't say anything. She asked if there had been continued harassment or contact from him after my initial report. I said no. She moved on to the next quickly.

Coworker 2 had been fired a while back for unrelated reasons, but Beth still asked if there had been any further conflict between us, while he was employed, other than the text messages. I said no.

She asked me the same question about Coworker 3. I told her that I had received texts from him on Saturday, that came across as threatening, and used several slurs about my sexuality. I gave her a printout of those messages. She read them, and immediately stepped out to show them to her manager. She came back after a few minutes to continue talking with me.

And again for Coworker 4. I told her that he had not contacted me after he said I was a bitch for leaving him on read

Beth asked me if I had any questions, and I basically asked what her next steps would be. She said that she would have asked me to remove the posts so that things could be handled with discretion, however I had already removed both prior to the meeting.  She also said that she would be meeting again with Coworkers 1 and 4. She also said that due to coworker 3's threatening comments, he had been escorted out of the building while we had been speaking. Fired. Apparently he was already on record with them, for another issue relating to his temper, and this was the last straw.

She also asked me why I had not brought coworkers 2, 3, and 4 to her attention before. And I cited the section on harassment from the company handbook, saying that harassment was repeated unwanted comments or actions. And that a single event is not usually considered harassment unless it is extreme. The conversations with those three men had been isolated incidents.

She asked me if I would be more comfortable taking a personal day for the rest of the day, while she speaks to Coworkers 1 and 4. She said she wanted to make it clear that I was not being dismissed or escorted out, I was not getting fired, it was only a precaution so that I would not be around Coworkers 1 and 4, in case either of them wanted to confront me personally. I said I would.

So that's where I'm at right now.

I think my (22M) girlfriend (20F) might be cheating on me with my roommate.,"My girlfriend and I have been together since high school. We go to the same college, and she basically lives me. We live in a 4 bedroom apartment with three others guys.

My roommates and I hang out a lot with my girlfriend, but she gets along especially well with one, we'll call him....Chet.

Chet is really close with my girlfriend. When I go to sleep (I go to bed really early), she goes and hangs out in his room. When I ask her about it, she tells me what good friends they are, and goes into detail about how she just could never even imagine his lips touching hers, that it makes her sick to think about. Part of me believes me, but part of me wonders why she goes into such detail about how repulsed she is by this idea.

Recently, they got into a fight because his girlfriend doesn't like my girlfriend. This fight ended in him buying her her favorite snacks and leaving them on our bed.

This seems like way intimate to be just a friendship to me, but I'm afraid to flat out ask her if they're sleeping together. I don't want to ruin our relationship over them just having a nice friendship. I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments and encouragement. No, I did not set up a spy cam or try to walk in on them. 

I chickened out I think because I deep down didn't WANT to catch them in the act. Turns out I didn't need to.

I stayed quiet about it, which wasn't too hard because I was really busy with school this week anyway. Last night, my girlfriend told me we should throw a party at our apartment. I didn't really want to, but figured why the hell not, I could stand to get pretty drunk anyway. So last night we invited a ton of people over, which is not out of the ordinary for us, and my girlfriend invited her best friend. It started out as just a normal party, until Chet got raging drunk and announced to everyone that he had just broken up with his girlfriend of 3 years. So, I did something sort of manipulative that I'm not totally proud of.

I told my girlfriend's best friend, I'll call her Kim, that she should hook up with Chet. We had all been drinking a lot, and I sort of suspected she was down for Chet anyway, and she agreed enthusiastically. 

Cut to Chet sitting on our couch with Kim quite literally on top of him making out.

I pointed this out to my girlfriend, telling her it would be so great if our bestfriends dated eachother.

My girlfriend lost it. Like completely lost it. She started screaming and pushing Kim off of Chet, telling her she couldn't believe both of them would do that. She ended stopping the whole party because she made such a scene, and I just stood there and watched. When she finally snapped out of it and realized everyone was staring at her, I thanked her for confirming what I already knew, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.

That was last night. I'm still sort of in shock it went down like that. I went to bed right after, and haven't talked to anyone about it yet this morning. I don't really know how I can look Chet in the face after this, so I haven't left my room yet. ",relationship_advice
"My pregnant wife blames her infidelity on ""pregnancy hormones""... What am I supposed to do with a baby on the way...","Title summarises it pretty much. For the last 3 months my life has been a living hell, my wife uses her pregnancy to defend making my life a living hell. Alongside the constant stream of demands during the day, almost every night for the last 3 months she wakes me up in the middle of the night to demand I make/buy her something she's craving. If I'm lucky it's something we have at home, often I find myself making 3am drives to 24hr gas stations or McDonalds despite starting work at 7:30 am. This even included making me fly from Wellington to Auckland to get her a stupid bloody giant ""big mac"" cookie because the store doesn't ship them to Wellington. She literally badgered me for a week before I finally relented and bought a plane ticket to get her the damn thing.

Anyway  sorry for the rambling, to the point of my problem. I found out she has been sexting guys she met on tinder. This all started after she got pregnant, and she is blaming pregnancy hormones for making her feel insecure/horny/etc etc. I know this excuse is probably bullshit, but fuck I'm a guy I have no idea about this sort of stuff.

If she wasn't pregnant I'd leave without saying another word to her. But she is. We have a kid on the way. I feel a moral obligation to make this work. The relationship was honestly MUCH BETTER before she got pregnant, so maybe she's telling the truth? Fuck me I'm rambling again.

How the hell am I supposed to fix this relationship when my wife is an emotional train wreck and uses ""pregnancy hormones"" whenever I try to make her see this?",relationship_advice
I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. How do I address this?,"We had been trying to have a baby for a few years. Eventually we found out I was sterile. We accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what I do in the future. Although we weren't trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. One day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. I was so happy and I thought it was amazing. We joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. The doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

The night that the baby was born I couldn't be happier. I was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. After a few days of taking care of her, I couldn't help but notice that she was extremely pale. For reference, I am black and she is white. I figure she would eventually darken a little and I didn't want to overthink it. 

Then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. They all mentioned that they didn't want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if I ever thought my fiancé would cheat on me. I thought I was very weird and then I knew exactly where they were going with it. I said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. However I still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

Now the baby is 5 months and I can't help but question if she's mine everyday. She has very fine hair. No kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. I know she's a baby but I have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. She is also still very pale. The thing that's been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more Asian in the eyes. I don't mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

Is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiancé when this would have never crossed my mind before? Am I just being paranoid? How do I go about addressing this? Do I even say anything? My biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that I accused her of sleeping with someone else. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.

"My [28F] boyfriend[29] intensely flirted with a ""good friend"" of his on instagram while we were on vacation together. We were planning on moving in together soon","We've been together for one year and prior to this happening, this was the happiest and healthiest relationship I've ever had. After having been in several long term relationships, he's the only one that I've ever truly wanted a future with. I'm also his first love. There was a lot I had to teach him about being a good partner, but I respected him, because when we had our issues, he listened and always showed me that he's willing to fix his side of things. I see him actually make changes to do so.

Now I have never looked into his phone before and had never felt the need to. However, a couple days ago while he was texting someone, I noticed one of his recently used emojis was a flirty one he's never used with me. I just had a nagging feeling someone wasn't right and I brought it up to him later when he was DMing a friend on instagram. When I asked to see his DMs, he got really defensive. I saw this girl's picture and asked who she was and apparently she was a ""good friend"" from his home state. I told him to show me their convo and he got extremely nervous and refused to let me see. After threatening to leave him, he finally showed me. It was a very flirtatious convo which started with her responding to his instagram story of a picture he took during our vacation. He complimented her, saying she's hotter than he remembers and ""thicc"", told her to come visit him during thanksgiving weekend (she lives in another state) repeatedly telling her that he really wanted to see her and take her around our city. She was reciprocative with the flirting but didn't seem to take him asking her to come too seriously. He responded with ""a man can only hope"". Convo stopped and then a couple of days later she messaged him again but there was no flirting and nothing brought up about their previous convo. 

After reading all this, I started packing up my things and broke up with him, I was shaking from anger. He started hysterically crying and begging me not to leave him, that this meant nothing, and he didn't know why he did it. I know he didn't physically cheat on me, but this hurts just the same. If he loved me as much as he claims he does, why would he have done it? We were in a great place, we were always so loving towards each other and supportive. 

He's been a mess since this happened and has been crying so much and hates himself for hurting me. He apologized so many times but has given me no excuses as to why he did it, that ""it just happened"". He even says he's not attracted to her and there were no intentions behind his words to her. He since messaged her with an apology for the flirting, that he shouldn't have done it and that they shouldn't talk anymore. He promises he will never betray me like that again and honestly my instinct believes him. But at the same time, I don't know how I should trust him again? Can I please get some advice on what to do and maybe help me understand why he could have done this?",relationship_advice
"My [27M] girlfriend [25F] spent the night with another couple. I know it's over, but I don't know how to deal with it.","Last night my live-in girlfriend of 3 years spent the night with another couple. A couple that we are very close to. The other couple is married and are male and female.

&#x200B;

Over the past year or so my girlfriend has been starting to experiment with women in the form of making out, dancing, etc. Overall I was okay with this as it's somewhat of a fantasy of mine in a living-through-her-vicariously way. Since I was a kid I have been stuggling here and there with a little body dysmorphia and often fantasize about being a woman with another woman. Normally in my day to day, however, I am very comfortable in my own body. So, like I said, I wasn't against the experimenting in any way.

&#x200B;

After talking to her about it numerous times, it went from just having a good time to not being comfortable with taking things forward to maybe having another person in the bedroom would be a fresh take on things. Typing this out it sounds like the classic she's-been-cheating-all-along, but I truly believe it's more of a discovery process.

&#x200B;

I told her I would definitely be willing to bring another girl into the bedroom and we agreed that the person would have to be right and someone we were both attracted to. Around New Years we were at our favorite bar for a party and I suggested we take a friend of ours home (not one from the couple). My girlfriend was hesitant, and I did not push, so that night we just went home and passed out together.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, my girlfriend made plans to go out to an event with a group of our friends, but I decided to stay home and try to take care of some backlog projects I've had going on. She had been messaging me all night, and finally around 1-2am she said she was coming home and would see me soon. It got to around 4am and I decided to log into her Apple account to use Find My iPhone just to make sure she was somewhere safe. This is nothing uncommon, yet not a frequent occurrence. (inb4 comments about being overcontrolling and other accusations). I figured she had been drinking quite a bit and decided to stay at the couples' place.

&#x200B;

I've had a bit of insomnia lately due to stress from work and side work, so I finally climbed into bed around 5am. Then I heard the garage door open and she came up to the bedroom. She said we should talk about something important. She then said that she slept with the wife. For the first 15 seconds I was happy for her, but quickly realized there was more on the horizon. She then explained that the husband was involved, but was more focused on the wife. Though she did let it slip out there was penetration (not that it matters that much in my mind at this point).

&#x200B;

My girlfriend has endometriosis which makes vaginal sex extremely painful. After talking for a while, our recent struggles with my work stress coupled with her worsening condition made it obvious that our sex life hasn't been great. That's when she let it slip that while the wife was a good experience, she still hurt (which only happens with penetration).

&#x200B;

That's when it finally hit my that I had been cheated on. I explained to her that it's one thing if we're both on board for bringing another person into the bedroom, but to not even be consulted on potentially sleeping with another woman, let alone a couple, is beyond the limits. I love this woman, but between this and our diminishing sex life with a dash of pettiness that comes to mind, I realize this relationship is over. This is my first real relationship, and first sexual relationship. Right now I am just afraid of having to start over. I've been taken advantage emotionally in romances before, and this has done nothing but drum these bad memories up.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] My (23F) [autistic] husband (36M) will only eat ""kiddie food"" [and lied by omission about his autism].","Previous post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bobslu/update_my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie/).

Well.

It's been a lot longer than the one week update I promised. I could make excuses but I won't.

For those of you who don't want to read my original post, I asked for help with my husband's food preference issues and through talking with many people on here and, ultimately, his mother, it was revealed that he was diagnosed with autism as a child.

Some of the comments on my original post were... not so kind. I got a lot of accusations that still hurt me. Some just make me angry, particularly the person who commented simply ""Please don't bully him."" He's my goddamn husband. Not a schoolyard friend, not a sibling, not a child. Infantilizing him doesn't help his case at all.

Moving on.

I was very upset as he had never mentioned anything to me. We've discussed all sorts of medical issues together but his diagnosis never came up.

I want to stress this: This isn't a matter of me not wanting to be married to an autistic man. This is a matter of my husband keeping something important from me and causing me a great deal of stress that could have been avoided if I was aware of his diagnosis.

For example, I continuously pushed him to try new foods or attend concerts or visit loud amusement parks. I knew he wasn't particularly thrilled about any of those things but they are all very normal couple activities that I wanted us to experience together. Had I been aware of his autism I would have had a better understanding of how negatively these things affected him, and made more of an effort to integrate things he liked with things I liked (maybe a smaller local band, or a craft fair instead of an amusement park).

Anyways. That's the backstory. Read below for the update.

**UPDATE**

I confronted him about my conversation with his mother the night before our counseling appointment. I made sure to bring it up casually so I didn't become angry again.

He tried to brush me off at first, saying he didn't know what I was talking about. After talking for a bit he eventually confessed that he not only knew of the diagnosis but deliberately kept it from me. He said I was his dream and he didn't want to do anything to ruin our ""perfect"" relationship.

I explained how him keeping this from me hurt me. I explained how I could have been there to support him instead of feeling like he needed to hide.

He said he wasn't ashamed of it at all. He explained that it's just not something that affects him anymore. I, again, explained how it affects me, but he didn't seem to care. I didn't show him the post I made but I used some of the advice from you all to try to explain why his autism really does in fact still affect his life.

We went to bed upset.

The next day he acted like nothing happened. We ate breakfast (he had chicken nuggets), and went about our day. I kept expecting him to bring it up but he never did.

I didn't have the nerve to bring it up again until later at the marriage counselor's office. I spoke to the counselor so as not to seem accusing and explained that this was an issue that bothered me.

My husband actually laughed and said he assumed I'd ""gotten over it by now"". When I explained that no, I really hadn't, he got angry with me and stormed out. The counselor tried to mediate but it wasn't much use as my husband went to wait in the car. I was worried he'd leave without me so I cut the meeting short.

Our ride home was quiet. It wasn't until we got home that I said I was worried he was keeping other things from me too.

He said he'd been reading online about how women can't understand autism and therefore he didn't think it was important to tell me about it. I said that was the weakest excuse I'd ever heard. He then said that I'd leave him if I knew. I said if I left him it'd be because he's a liar.

Apparently he told all of our mutual friends that he'd ""just"" been diagnosed with autism and I was considering leaving him because of it. Now many of our friends won't talk to me and act very cold when we run into each other in public. I don't know what else he's told them but I think he told someone I cheated on him as a fake account has been commenting horrible things about me and my supposed sexual habits on all of my instagram posts. I keep reporting them but then it seems like another just pops up in its place. 

I haven't decided if divorce is the right path. I know he's been browsing ""incel"" and other bitter male-centric websites (one of his friends is a self-described ""incel"") so I'm even more convinced that this isn't the man I married.

I'm mostly just confused. I've been avoiding him at home and it feels like more of a room mate situation at this point. He doesn't really leave his den until it's time for work, and then he's back in the den until bed.

It seems like everything is messed up, just from me wanting to help. I don't even know what to expect at this point, much less how to move on from here.

**EDIT**

There are so many more comments than I anticipated. I'm trying to at least read through most of them although I think I'm past my emotional ability to reply. I'm really shocked at how overwhelmingly supportive people are being. Thank you.

I'm going to be discussing divorce with a lawyer. I don't know how to bring it up with him but I'm past the point of caring. You're all right; I dread coming home to him in the evenings, I dread if he will miraculously want to talk. This isn't healthy for either of us. At the very least some time apart would be good.

That's all for now. I don't think I'll update past this, as I'm already uncomfortable with how quickly this blew up. But I will be living elsewhere by the end of the month.",relationship_advice
"So my (m/27) GF (f/23) went out for dinner and some drinks with this guy she had a crush on. She always told me he was „just a friend"" and she doesn't „even see him as a male"". Anyway, I recently found out they had sex and kinda dated shorty before we started dating. Is it wrong being hurt?","Hi Reddit,

French guy here, so please excuse my English. But I guess you'll get the point.

Long story short: there was this guy and I always kind of felt like he and my now-gf have had something in the past. I know him and saw him occasionally. However, my gf and I started dating about two years ago and we made fun of this guy on a regular basis and she assured me she had never ever dated this guy nor had there been any feelings between them both. I believed her, since she was looking straight in my eyes when saying these things with a confidence that I would've never doubted that this was the truth. 

Fast forward: we started dating and about two months in the relationship she got a message from that guy asking if she wanna meet the week after to get some drinks, since he was in Paris that day. She told me and asked if I was cool with her meeting that guy next week. Well, I am not really cool with it, but fuck it, he's a friend and who am I to tell her who she is allowed to meet anyway. I told her so. However, I was kind of hurt and also angry (kept this for myself) that she didn't ask if I wanted to join her - I would've not wanted to join (he's a jerk, seriously!), but I somehow think it would have been appropriate to ask though. I would have asked her if I was in her place. 

I told her that I feel uncomfortable that she's gonna meet him.. in the late evening..just the two of them..having drinks..without me. She got annoyed and was arguing with me, giving me the feeling that I was totally wrong and that she really wanted to meet a friend of hers and that it's me who is keeping her from doing so because I was an overly jealous macho (which I am not at all). So I gave in and told her that if she wanted to go and see him, she shall do it. She did,

I was annoyed, but told myself that I had no right to feel this way and with some time passing by I didn't really think of it anymore. A couple of months later I was looking for some documents that I needed for an appointment the following day and, accidentally, found a nice looking scratchpad. I didn't know it and wanted to see if it was empty and if so I would've used it for work notes (I have lots of such pads). So I was rapidly skimming the pages, not expecting or looking for anything and - there was his NAME, literally jumping me in the eye! I wouldn't have read a single word if I hadn't read his name - it was like ""Fuck! Please let it be something trivial."". But it wasn't trivial at all: 

She was in love with him, she even wrote it down many many times, and when I asked her she always told me that they had something a few months before we dated. So all the times we made fun of him being an idiot, every time she told me that she would've never go out with him, that he was just a friend..... All lies, lies she has told me right in my face. And then she would go out with him when we were already dating for months and making me feel uncomfortable because I didn't want her to see him that evening?! 

I was shattered and probably still am. It's that she lied to my face, making an idiot out of me by making fun of him though knowing she had something with him, and telling me she wouldn't even see him as a male so she could see him that evening. What. The. Fuck, 
Sure I was playing things through in my head, everyone is afraid of being hurt, but I seriously NEVER EVER would have thought that SHE would do something like this to me (or anyone else), she's a perfect partner, who just would not do ""such things"". I was so wrong and couldn't really handle my emotions and broke down for the rest of the day, still being in ""fights"" with my mind which fucks with me from time to time. I still think that I am not knowing all about what was going on with him and her and sometimes it's killing me inside. 

I love this woman from the bottom of my heart and I am sure she is ""the one"" for me so I never even thought about leaving her, because I never would. And I have no doubt that she loves me, too. But it hurts so badly and I just had to get this off my chest, hoping there are people who can tell me what they did when they have been in such a situation. What eases the pain and what can I do to trust my partner again 100%? I don't want this to be something that haunts me all my life.

Thanks.

TL;DR
GF met with a guy we both know for dinner and drinks. Didn't ask me to join them and most importantly, she lied about sleeping with him shortly before we dated although I asked her exactly this many times because I always thought they have had something going on in the past. Why didn't she tell me right at the start? - There would've been no problem now at all. Why would she want to meet him anyway?

He was having a conversation with a woman. She sounded very flirty and was saying something like ""you like it better with me than her, don't you baby?"" And he answered that he did.

He must have realized the phone was on because that night when he got home he came right out and told me he's met someone else and wants a divorce to be with her. 

The few people I've told say at least we don't have kids which I am sick of hearing. It's true, but it doesn't make me feel any better.

It has been about a month or so since I posted and I figured I would update you guys(since I love updates). Unfortunaly is not a good one...

My father asked for a divorce about a week after the post, it caught me out of guard and I was shocked. They talked before this but my dad came home even more upset than the day on the restaurant.

He asked me whether I'd like to live with him or my mom and I chose him. I love my mom to death but on the day-to-day basis I get along better with my father. I called her to explain but as soon as I said said she disconnected the call so yeah.... I wrote her a letter and tried to give when we went home to her our things but she ripped off, which was very painful to see. My dad and brother started screaming at her and I left with my SIL.

I went with my dad to have a consultation with my psychologist and they tried to help me see why she is doing this. From what I can understand, there might be some reasons

I went through a pretty tough period, I got depressed, anxious and had some problems with eating disorder but I've been in medication and therapy, which has helped a lot. After this I felt much happier and had energy to work on myself, I started working out with my brother, my SIL teached me how to use make up and my grandma gave me a bunch of gift cards to buy some new clothes. I've also started trying new hobbies and my days are really busy.

We think that my mom started feeling left out and jealous of me, especially since my brother/dad started paying more attention to me and I know they have actively making an effort to compliment me and pay attention to what I say/am interested in.

She thought that with the new baby she would be the grandma but she and my SIL don't get along that well(they don't fight but they don't have much in common either) and I guess she was feeling pretty sad.

After the post I started wondering whether my mom had been through some sort of abuse, which could explain her reaction to my dad seeing me naked and whatnot. It wasn't that.

My dad said he was a victim of sexual abuse and that it came from someone he trusted and was family, so my mom saying this made him enraged. He tried talking to her after but apparently she just kept implying it and he can't keep being married to someone who would say this.

There's more about it but that's basically what went wrong.

I'm honestly heartbroken, I can't wrap my head around what my mom did and I still feel guilty about this whole story(even more now, since it was bc of me that felt left out). I don't know what our relationship will be like, my dad has the full custody but said I could visit her anytime I want but we haven't talked yet and she hasn't tried to contact me.

My brother still talks to her but not as much, he says she is ok, he said she asks about me but I think he's lying. 

We are living with my grandma but will move to a new house next month, it seems like a cool place and is close to my brothers work.

On a happier note, SIL is almost ready for the baby and the name I suggested was the chosen one! I can't wait to meet my niece :D

I don't want my twin sister in my wedding party and my mom can't handle it.,"My twin sister and I have had a horrible relationship for the last 23 years of our life. The kind of relationship that people said ""oh you'll get over when you're older"". Except I'm not over it. She physically and verbally abused me my entire life and continues to do so over trivial things now. 

When I was 18 I ended up moving 44 hours away from my family, but it was to get away from her. She's ruined most of my friendships and I just couldn't handle her anymore. After moving, her and I have been for the most part NC. When we do talk it's always for her to start a fight. Either making me feel bad for not coming home for a holiday, or just something. 

Most of my family understands our relationship but my mom, as she has for my entire life continues to be oblivious to it. ""Oh it's not that bad"" or ""All siblings fight"". She's the kind of  mom you see in those movies saying ""my baby would never do that"", as the child is getting hauled away for murder ... Yep that would be her.  I've been in therapy for the last 5 year to try and get over our relationship.

 But aside from the whole woe is me...

Two months ago I got engaged to the most amazing person. And as one would, I called my parents, then called my older sister and finally I called my twin. Hoping that she would be happy for me, or idk just something..... Welp, she was not. She told me how selfish I was for getting engaged to a man who lived so far away and how she already knows I'm never going to come back home. How selfish that is to my mother and went on like that until I hung up about 30 minutes later. She told me that I should be ashamed for asking guests and my family to come to my wedding so far away. Which I had already planned to offer at least half the cost of plane tickets. Even more for my family.. but whatever. 


This month we have begun to plan the first details of the wedding. The guest maximum for the ceremony would be 100 and I think that's even more than I was thinking originally. As I'm really just wanting it to be close friends and family. We were planning to invite more people to the reception (is that normal? I've never been to a wedding before), people with kids and friends that I'm not as close to. 

We have decided that at most each of us would have 4 bridesmaids/groomsmen. I'm still trying to figure out who will be it as well. However, already I know that the last person I want to be my MOH is my sister. I don't really even want her being in my bridal party. That decision has all but crushed my mother. She's really really upset about it. Calling me names and telling me how selfish I am for not being able to let go of our childhood. 

I hate to see her upset. However I know that having my sister in one of those roles will for sure lead to fights and I really don't want to be judged for every decision I make. 

Would it ruin my relationship with my sister forever if I don't have her in my wedding? I would like to have some sort of relationship one day. What can I do and how would I even tell her that she's not in the party without causing a fight

*** Update****

Thank you for the support everyone! It's been quite a busy couple of weeks for my fiance and I. I have decided not to have my sister in my party and invite her to the reception only.

Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"This has happened with every single guy I've dated or been interested in. I've only had 3 relationships before my current one with ""John"". My twin sister ""Sarah"" has tried to interfere with all of them. 

Two of my ex's cheated on me with her. The third we broke up for other reasons but Sarah still tried to seduce him. He was a good guy and always had boundaries with her, but that didn't stop her from trying. To the point of sending him nudes multiple times then claiming ""oops wrong person"" when he told her he wasn't interested.

When that didn't work she also tried to break us up by lying to my ex and our mutual friends that I was cheating. My ex didn't believe her but some friends did. So yeah that was fun to deal with...

Then, when we were kids like in middle/high school, if Sarah found out I had a crush she went after the guy herself. I used to tell her those things because well, isn't that what sisters do. She always used it against me. I told her I was working up the courage to ask my crush/ the guy I was ""talking to"" to prom. She then asked him and he said yes. She said he'd just been using me to get to her. Another time a few years before that she announced to everyone in a class we shared that I liked this one boy who got bullied a lot. Kids then started teasing him even more and he hated me. I felt horrible for months, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. She also once told a teacher who's class I was doing bad in that I was into him and willing to do ""favors"" for better grades. That got reported and I had to go through this whole counseling thing before it was finally cleared up. It was extremely embarrassing. My sister just blew it off as a prank.

There's so many other situations like this, she either gets guys who are interested in me to sleep with her or ruins my chances with them by making up bullshit to make me look bad. She's ruined some of my friendships lying about me too (told my best friend in high school I was gossiping meanly about her and went so far as faking text messages.) I don't know if she even actually wants these people for herself. You might think it's obviously jealousy but sometimes I honestly think she just gets a kick out of messing with me.

Anyway I've finally got my life more together after wasting the first couple years of college on being depressed and a gaming addiction. I met my boyfriend ""John"" at a campus organization. I haven't told Sarah, but he ended up meeting my parents by accident today. I don't have much contact with them but they decided to come for a surprise visit... they live over 5 hours away and do this a few times a semester even though I've said I don't like it. But that's for another post. John was in my room with me when they got here. I had no choice but to introduce them (he knows I was holding off on having them meet because I don't have the greatest relationship with them)

Sarah lives at home with my parents while going to college locally. I'm certain they're going to mention meeting my boyfriend. And then cue her insisting on coming with them the next time they surprise-visit me. Also stalking my social medias to try to figure out who he is.

I've tried to explain the issues I have with her to my parents. They think I'm over reacting, they say she just wants to know what's going on in my life. To be involved. Yes that is the problem...her involvement. 

And, not to mention we used to be closer before I lost trust in her to stop doing this shit, so I've seen what her own life is like. She does things my parents have no idea of. She takes party drugs sometimes. This wouldn't be a big deal but she has no idea how to be responsible. She drives people around while drunk and high, my parents think she's with a friend studying on weekends but she's actually clubbing in the city and then crashes with her friends for the night. I'm not sure how many real boyfriends she's had but she's hooked up with a lot of guys the same night she met them. This has meant a few times she was scared of pregnancy. I've had to help her get Plan B. It sometimes feels like she sleeps with nearly any man that smiles at her, and told me she's even had ""sex"" with a few girls while wasted however that's possible... she confides all these things to me, but whenever I need someone to talk to she has no time. Never wants to hear anything unless she can save it as ammo. So I've gradually stopped telling her most things.

If my parents knew all this they might see where I'm coming from, it's not just random that I don't want her meeting my boyfriend. It's not because I want to hurt her or something. The problem is, our parents are really strict and traditional, and they'd probably kick her out if I told them any of that. They don't believe in sex before marriage. My boyfriend is the first person I've had sex with, and I'm afraid my sister could use that against me to them if she finds out.

So what do I do? How can I keep Sarah from finding out about him and doing the same thing she's done with all my past boyfriends? How do I explain it to my parents?

TL;DR: my sister has a pattern of interfering with my relationships. She's gotten guys to cheat on me with her. My parents accidentally met him today and will probably tell her. How do I keep her away from him?",relationship_advice
Girlfriend wanted to get the first letter of my name tattooed,"So me (m19) my gf (f19) have been together for 2 years 

She recently brought up the idea of getting a tattoo of the first letter of my name on her wrist 

Im all for her doing what she wants with her body, and i really want to be with her

But i just dont think its the smartest thing 

We are very stable however i just dont think tattoos of a lover are a good idea especially since we are such a young age 

How should I approach telling her i dont think its a good idea and not making her think its because i don't believe in our relationship?

Edit 2: will definitely be getting her a necklace as someone recommended, forgot who and will also talk to her about getting some sort of other tattoo! ",relationship_advice
My sister (F35) asked me (F25) if I could give her my honeymoon after I broke it off with my ex fiance.,"Hi. Sorry for bad English it's not my first lenguage. Also throwaway because my main has too much identifying information. 

So I was supposed to get married tommorow and go to a honeymoon to Santa Marta at Monday.

Well I found out the fuck head had been cheating on me with my (ex) friend for about a month and I broke it off.

I planed to go alone to the honeymoon or with a friend but my sister approached me and asked if she could have them. She is a mother of 3 and hasn't gotten vacation in almost 6 years. She eloped with her husband because of tax reasons and they haven't been on a honeymoon.

I feel conflicted. I love my sister but it would hurt to give my honeymoon to another couple that *is* happy. Idk if I am wallowing in self pitty but some insight would be appreciated.
Edit: my sister is not selfish people. She approached me and said that she understand if it's not possible but if she could have my honeymoon for the reasons stated. She was very respectful


**Update** I decided that my sister would go to my honeymoon. I just went to her place and she actually cried when I told her she could go. I feel much better now. But the husband insisted that he pay at least my flight of I want to get away with my friends. Thanks for your help!",relationship_advice
I (28M) ruined my girlfriends (23F) family's favorite movie and now they hate me,"For the last year and a half I've been dating a girl I met through a friend. We get along extremely well- we both love movies, the same music, stand up
comedians, I'm an avid filmmaker and she likes to edit- everything has been great. 
She's not from around here and we decided to fly out and have me meet her family for the first time. It's been going relatively well in my opinion, but tonight we decided to watch their favorite movie: The Fourth Kind.
For those that don't know, it's an alien abduction movie that tries to act like all of the events are 110% true. I'd never seen it so they wanted to show me. Halfway through the movie her dad said something along the lines of ""I wonder why this wasn't a big deal when it happened?"" To which I said ""well the movie is fake- them saying the events were real is a bunch of shit."" 
Apparently for the last 10 or so years they've believed that the movie was true. The whole family immediately freaked out at me- her dad kicked me out of the house and now I'm waiting to fly back home a week and a half early. I've tried to call my girlfriend but she hasn't said anything to me yet. What should I do to remedy the situation?


Update nearly 24 hours later: girlfriend and I have talked- her and her family got in a huge fight after I left and came home. Apparently her dad was mainly upset of my Polish heritage (they're Swedish so I guess there's bad blood there? I'm not too caught up on that) and me pointing out that The Fourth Kind is fake was just kind of the tipping off point. She agrees that her family is kind of crazy too. I guess we won't see them that often!",relationship_advice
** Update **I (24m) was technically raped by a girl (23f) and now she's becoming friends with my friends,"Original Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bofs9f/i_24m_was_technically_raped_by_a_girl_23f_and_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

So it's been about a week since things happened with finding my friends with the girl who raped me. Many of you helped me understand that and I took everyone's advice and recently started seeing a therapist to help, ty. 

To the people who said I deserved it or who were gatekeeping being a rape victim, I wish that you never go through what I've been dealing with. Even if you're cruel you don't deserve what I've been feeling.

So I met my friends two days later. The were calling me, asking to see me. I had taken two days off sick because I just had a mental breakdown. I couldn't really function. Next thing I know, I'm laying in my bed and I hear a knock on my door. When I went and opened it, it was Friends A, B, and C. They came to check on me. I let them in and they demanded I told them what was going on. 

We sat on my couch and for a moment I was silent. But friend A nudged me, and I came clean. I told him how she and I had been hanging out together, how we had been drinking and I let her stay at my place to sober up, and when I said no to sex, I woke up to her riding me. 

I then explained how to try and gain control, the day after, she asked to have sex and I said yes, but what I hadn't mentioned in my post was that I couldn't get it up, I felt too horrifically gross with her, and that I instead locked myself in my restroom. Saying that I was having the runs and got a Lyft for her home. I cried hard. I told them how when I saw her how my stomach lurched and how I felt like yelling and so angry. How awful I felt and that's why I left, then I told them how my family had blamed me and called me a pussy for not wanting sex. 

I just vented it all in tears, and when I couldn't choke back sobbing friend A hugged me. It had been months since I had touched someone else, I couldn't bring myself to for some reason, but hugging him felt right and that's when I realized he and Friends B and C were crying too.

For a moment things were weepy and Friend B and C hugged me with A and just said soothing things to calm me down. They made jokes, I laughed and said sorry to them. Then then told me how the night went.

So the night they hung out, and I left immediately. friend A, Friend B and C questioned R (Girl who raped me). She said that we had just had a negative experience on a date and that she didn't know why I would be upset. That it probably wasn't even about her. Issue is Friend A had seen how I was looking at her and felt weary, but apparently she's was a new coworker of his at the restaurant he works at and she had wanted to hang with him and he said yes. 

So when they start drinking and Catching up on Game of Thrones (intended thing to do that night), they watched her pop some pills and start chugging down her beers, which were red flags immediately to my guys because she admitted herself she didn't know exactly what she was taking, and tried to get really intimate with friend A. So thing is Friend A is in a relationship so he tells her no, yet she still tries to cuddle him and stuff, though he doesn't want that. 

So the episodes end and she's too out of it to drive and says she doesn't have the money for a Lyft. Thing is my friends have been drinking so they can't drive either so then she asks if they can let her sleep here for the night. They all agree and after B and C leave it's just A, making the couch for her to sleep.

That's when she asks to sleep with him, and he says no. So she tries again, and he refuses. So now A is pissed off, so he tells her once he's taken a nap he's taking her ass home. So he goes to his room, leaving her. He then tries to take a nap only to wake up to find R trying to get in his bed naked, and he flips. 

He was furious and called B and C, and they kicked her out of the apartment with most her clothes in hand. He then notified their boss in the morning and she was fired from her job for drug abuse. That's not the end though,

She went to the police the day after they kicked her out, and she actually filed a false rape claim against friend A, Issue is when police came to question him luckily he had a camera for his room since he's always been paranoid, and now I know why. Police came and he showed them the video evidence that vindicated him immediately. So now she's facing some severe penalties and issues over what she did. False police report and whatnot. 

They asked me to bring up what she did to me with the police. But honestly I don't know if I can or if bringing up something I can't prove like my friend is even worth it. What I do know is at the moment I haven't lost my friends, and I honestly don't care what happens to her. I just want to get over this. So I'll continue to go to therapy, and my friends will support me, and I'll support them. For once I don't feel like my name on here is as accurate anymore.",relationship_advice
"My babies and I escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3AM last night... I'm scared, my kids are confused... I don't even know how I feel right now but nothing seems real.","[UPDATE]
Just received a call from the police in our town. It was a weird area code so I almost didn't answer. He said he was with our police department and that my kids dad called them. I told him we were at a domestic violence shelter and he said he read the report and wasn't calling to get info for him but to make sure me and the kids are okay. I told him about the non step messages and phone calls and he said to make sure my advocate sees all the messages and to write it down and that if he keeps harassing me to call him back even before the protective order is officially filed. Sounds like they are on my side too. Thank god. 
[END UPDATE]

My children's dad and I have been together for about 4 and a half years. The insults, emotional abuse and mental instability were apparent from literally day one but I think I was so broken and damaged back then I was just happy not to go to bed alone.  The physical violence started within a couple of weeks. I still remember crying on my way to work within the first month of us dating asking myself ""Why are you in this? Why are you allowing this to happen to you?"" after he drug me by the hair the night before through the apartment to the bathroom after I didn't clean it to his standards. 

When I finally told myself I would rather be lonely than treated this way and was prepared to leave I found out I was pregnant and everything changed. I was always told I couldn't have kids so this was my miracle and I wanted to see if I could make this family work. I spent almost the whole pregnancy in the hospital with HG and cardiac problems wracking up medical bills and losing everything including my car since I couldn't work. By the time my son got here though none of it mattered... he was my world and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. On the way home from the hospital my ex's sister asked me if he had ever been abusive to me and it caught me off guard... I just said no and stared ahead as she told me of his history. Another dumb move on my part just hoping I could make it work. 

Almost every day there was some type of conflict... any inner turmoil or demons he faced would turn into him trying to take anyone around him down with him. My name basically became ""cunt"" and the bruises faded and new ones came and faded again. 

I became pregnant with our second child and nothing changed still. I still have the photos from when he punched me in the face and busted my upper and lower lips open when I accidentally burnt his pizza. 
Our baby girl arrived and once again was the most precious gift to me but things continued to take darker twists with every unstable mood he would come home in.  His favorite thing to do was tell our toddler son to ""get a knife and stab mommy""

Last night was the end though. I have been saving to leave and was hoping to be able to be out by summer. The day started with him angry about nothing and coming home from work telling me I'm a worthless piece of shit. He left to go to a bar and came back around 11pm so drunk he could barely put words together but was still able to throw soda cans, objects and food at my head, start yelling the ""n"" word over and over again and call me every name in the book through his drunken slurring. After he threw something else and tagged me in the face I finally called the police and before they got there he took off. I filed a report and locked all the doors. 

He started texting me saying some of the most psychotic things like ""I hear you beating the kids, stop beating the kids, why are you doing this. Let me in, stop beating he kids"", so I had to take pictures all over the outside and inside of the house to make sure I have time stamped proof he was out of his mind. 

I called an emergency domestic violence shelter I was referred to and they said they would get us in at 7 am but before I could even get done packing he busted down the deadbolted door so I threatened to call the police again, picked up the kids and ran. We got to the police station where the shelter volunteers got us safely to the shelter. I have never felt so much relief in my life but so much anxiety of what is to come. 

He has been texting me all day going between threatening messages and apologies. Saying he would rather the kids end up in foster care than with me and that he will make false CPS reports against me. 

The shelter is helping me get a protective order and build cases against him for both victims compensations, CPS, and custody and are helping with counseling and legal aid. 

It's so strange to say it's over... there is so much ahead but I'm free. My kids are free.... 

Sorry for the rambling... I can barely process what's been happening ",relationship_advice
Me (15F) My mom (30sF) cares more about drinking and fucking guys than being a parent.,"Yo I'm 15 and utterly clueless how to deal with my ""mother""

That's in quotes because she doesn't act like one. Never has. I don't know who my dad was. Neither does she. Yep she's that kind of person.

None of my siblings dads are around. They're either locked up or didn't care or she refuses to talk to them for who knows why. She stopped persuing child support from the one she had contact with bc it was ""too much work"" but when she used to get the child support, she just spent it all on shit for herself. Like tattoos, alcohol, clothes.

She's addicted to online shopping, the apartment is stuffed with her shit and she doesn't even use most of it. Also she doesn't clean. I have to clean (I'm the oldest) or it doesn't happen. Before I learned to clean, we got tons of ants and flies, we had roaches for months before she finally was willing to pay for getting rid of them. Said she ""didn't want to waste money"", but she wastes money all the time on whatever she wants. Food and bills are an after thought. She has WIC but literally can't be bothered to get us food unless I nag her when we're flat out. Then she just loads up with garbage from the dollar store, so I'm really worried about my siblings, bc some of them are getting really overweight and she doesn't ever take us to the doctor and I don't even know if we've got health insurance.

She bounces around between temp jobs, nothing permanant, bc if she worked fulltime she couldn't party. She's almost always out at night sometimes during the day. Or she's passed out drunk. I've dragged her to her bed bc she blacked out in the bathroom or on the floor. Or, some random dude shows up after midnight hauling her in the door as she's unable to walk. How do these men have keys??? She just copies the key and gives it to literally ANYONE she trusts. Which is practically everyone, she has no idea who's a good person or bad person. As a result there are men who have touched me when I was younger. Now I can fight them and protect myself and my siblings. She never protects us. She doesn't care. She called me a liar bc that's her boyfriend so he wouldn't do that blah blah blah. 

There is a revolving door of these ""boyfriends."" They don't last longer than a year and even when she's with a guy guaranteed she's fucking at least one other. Me and my siblings can clearly hear the telltale slapping sounds and disgusting groaning and fakeass porno screeches coming from her room. It's happened at all hours of the night waking us up. We've even found nasty sex toys and fetish outfits in places outside of her bedroom.

She's pregnant right now (kid number 8) and STILL doing this. Still drinking too. I mean what the fuck, I started suspecting she's doing this for money (she's randomly suddenly had cash after nights like that after saying there was no money for food or whatever) and asked if she was a prostitute, she slapped me across the face. Well that's my answer I guess. I know she's been a stripper so it's more than likely. Anyway I still said why is she okay poisoning a baby and risking one of these abusive guys injuring it, she said I can't judge her until I'm a mother. So whatever. I'm never gonna be one looooool

Then, despite constantly being broke and relying on the minor government aid + whatever these fuckboys give her (she begs online for donations all over social media), she went and got a huge fucking boobjob a couple years ago. I was only 13 but I've been constantly aware of our poverty. I've been bullied for it, even my 5 year old brother got teased at school about his clothes. It's impossible to NOT be aware. I started learning when rent and bills are due to try to get my mom to keep on top of it so our electricity and heat stops getting shut off. Then she goes and buys fake tits. It's like, what is even the point. She's gonna blow her money every time no matter what I do.

I'm so scared and sick of always worrying about money. We've been evicted 5 times that I can remember. Utilities shut off countless times. Half the time I have to make my younger siblings ramen for dinner because it's all I can afford from the change she leaves us.

I'm so sick of the grossness of the apartment, the grossness of the men always coming and going, her dressing like a hooker, using her tits to get men now that she looks twice her age thanks to alcohol addiction, the trashiness of everything in my life. The apartment is 3 bedrooms with half the living room hosting me and my next oldest sister's bunk beds and the other half hosting my mom's piles of junk. The rest of my siblings are split between the other two bedrooms and then my mom has the third. Everyone's room is covered in clothes toys books and random junk on the floor, bc there's simply no space for anything that could store it. Garbage and masses of toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom and mold in the shower. Garbage always overflowing in the kitchen. Dirty stove fridge and oven I can never stay on top of. Everything's old and falling apart. No AC or fans in 90+ heat. It's just shit. She couldn't care less she's hardly ever here so sees no reason to care.

I hate that I can't give my siblings a better childhood. I hate that she won't make a single effort to do that when it's her responsibility, SHE'S THE PARENT NOT ME, but I cannot stand to see them neglected. They all see me and my next oldest sister as parents more than her. We are ""their moms"" they say. We bathe them and dress them, do laundry when we can. We take care of each other when we're sick.

Please get one thing clear from my post besides that I hate my mom, it's that I love my brothers and sisters. I would do anything to make their lives just a little better. But I don't know how when we're stuck living in this place with this person. I realized we'll have to get out on our own for things to get better but even once I'm old enough, they won't be. I could adopt them but I doubt I could get custody of all 6 + the baby that's coming + however many fucking more kids she decides to pop out over the next 3 years.

Plus even though they listen to me about hygiene and chores they don't listen about school. No matter what I try, short of bribing with junk food I can't get them to do their homework. But I'm a hypocrit bc I don't always do mine either, I don't have time sometimes or I'm so tired I just can't.

Is there any way to make my mom be an actual mom? How do I at least get her to stop drinking while pregnant and stop hooking up with randoms. Like the older I get the more fucked up I see it is, and the angrier I am. I don't wanna hate everything but so many days I do.",relationship_advice
My husband [M34] gave me [F29] herpes after cheating with a sex worker,"We've been together 7 years, married for 4. My sexual preferences are pretty boring, I just like regular old vanilla stuff. His tastes are a little more adventurous. I've always said I'm happy to try anything once. Trouble is I've never enjoyed any of the things we've tried and I feel like I'm leaving him unsatisfied. He floated the idea of maybe seeing a sex worker to allow him to explore some of these kinks and I said maybe that was an option we could consider at some stage. We are in Australia where sex work is legal. 

Anyway, recently he went on a work trip to Italy for 10 days. He used the services of a local MtF sex worker. He didn't tell me about it. We had sex the day he got home. A few days later I was feeling unwell and experiencing strange symptoms, went to the doctor and found out it was herpes. 

I confronted him about it and he admitted what he had done and that he had also noticed a spot/mark on his penis but 'didn't think anything of it'. 

I'm so upset that not only did he go ahead and sleep with someone without checking in with me, he also put my health at risk. The least he could have done was get an STD test afterwards. I'm also now wondering if he would have ever told me if he hadn't been 'sprung'. 

I've always tried to be accomodating and understanding of his needs so I don't know why he felt the need to go behind my back. I now find it hard to trust him and I don't know if I can have sex with him again. Is our relationship salvageable? Or are we just sexually incompatible?

I think my (28m) gf (28f) might be cheating on me. How to approach the subject without accusing her?,"Throaway because she introduced me to reddit and reads this sub.

My GF (28f) and I (28m) have been togheter for two years. She's everything I have ever dreamed and we will move together next year. We have talked about marriage and starting a family together. I don't see a future without her tbh. 

She has always been loyal, she is against cheating due to her father cheating on her mom several years ago, and I have never had any doubts until now. It's a very touchy subject for her and she has begged me from the start to leave her if I ever want to cheat. To accuse her of cheating would hurt her for sure. 

However since a couple of months ago she has started using an old phone of hers, I have never seen her using it before and she doesn't use it in front if me but she is not secretive about it... she just leaves it charging in her room in the open, but it's always charging when I am at her place so I know she is using it. 

I thought it had something to do with her studies because she is very tech savy but today her rommate let me in and when I got into her room she closed it as soon as she saw me and she seemed guily as fuck.
But again, she did not hid it, she put it on her nightstand and we went out. 

Now I'm home and she is asleep next to me and I can't stop thinking about that damn cellphone. 

I don't know how to approach the subject with her: I cannot snoop because she uses an anti-theft app on all her devices so I will be busted immediately, and honestly I don't want to breach her trust.
I am afraid she will get mad and hurt if I accuse her of cheating, especially if it's not true but I can't think of any explanation for this fucking cellphone. 

Ant tips on how to approach the subject?



EDIT: I woke her up because I couldn't sleep and since the general consensus was to ask I did. 
She was pissed because I woke her up and when I told her why she started laughing. 
She took the phone, put the password ( it was the same as her main phone) and showed me.... it was a mobile game. 
She was embarassed because it's a ""stupid game"" and she feels too old to play mobile games. She is using an old phone because it's addictive and this way she only plays at home with the wifi. 
She gave me the phone and it's the only app installed, whatsapp was disabled, facebook as well. 
She apologized for making me worry but she said to just ask next time. And she went back to sleep.

My wife is cheating on me on F*cking Valentine's day,"I am crushed right now. Now I have a real reason to hate valentine's day. This morning, before leaving to work, I[32M] saw my wife's[33F]  phone notification light flashing so I checked, it was a message from a private number so I read through all the messages. The messages were from the night before and here are how some went; 'hey can't wait to see you tomorrow my husband is going to work so we have all morning long' 'Look wear something like this for me tomorrow baby' 'I wanna be inside you already especially inside your own house' 'I will do anything you want me to do for you in bed, I'm doing specially for you I don't even do it for my husband'. We have been together for 12 years total and we had plans to have kids already and have a family

I took pictures of the chat with my phone since I think this is most likely ending in a divorce. I decided to come home early and I walked into my house silently and it was confirmed they were cheating on my own bed. I left without making noise and I had a big beautiful rose for her, I cut a small part of my wrist and let some blood on the paper with the rose and I wrote a note to her saying 'here is your love'.

I drove off to a liquor store and bought whiskey and swishers and I picked up half an ounce of Marijuana from a friend. I drove to a mountain that has a cliff of the whole city and right now I'm here and she keeps on texting and calling me like she is desperate. I am losing my mind here. I am still up here just looking at the lights and I feel like my world just ended. I hate the thought of myself now and I just feel like I don't even belong here anymore

Tl;dr my wife is cheating on valentin'es day and I don't want to be here anymore

Update 1- I am driving home now and will probably sleep outside in the hammock or something

Update: I am home safe now ordered some food and I have another blunt left but I will stay outside in the backyard for now- I am invited my cousin and his wife over, he is basically like a brother to me so I will most likely be okay

Update- she heard my cousin and his wife pull up and she came out. Okay she started crying and basically throwing a tantrum and begging me to forgive her. Well my cousin's wife Maria took her inside and sat down with her so they're talking and I'm outside with my cousin taking a smoke break

Update: I woke up to her crying to me and begging. I didn't say anything. I feel dead on the inside like if somebody ripped my heart out and smashed it on the floor

Edit:i didn't expect even half of these comments thanks a lot for the support sorry if I don't grt to reply to everyone I fell asleep. I am off to work for the day and will rewd your comments after I am back thanks again

Edit: I haven't done much yet but I plan on going up the mountain again with my cousin and his wife to look down at the lights. We are going to hang out up there and hit some Wax to relax a little. I talked to my wife finalky asking why she cheated and I don't know whether to believe this or not but she said 'it was the thrill of having a new guy showeing with attention"" then again she cried and begging to work it out and I went for a walk without saying a word. Apparently she has been talking this guy for a few months and met him at a grocery store. She told me the while truth and that they onky went in dates and that that was the first time the had sex. I am not trying to be cucked so fuck no I am not trying to fix this shit anymore I'm done being a helpess mister fucking nice guy. I know I kind of overreacted at first but thank you guys for helping me stop hurting myself. I am not going to use any hardcore drugs just some Mari-J and some whiskey nothing more. Sorry if I snapped at you in the comments I am just having mixed emotions of anger and sadness

Update: I give up now. I can't take it or handle it anymore I just give up",relationship_advice
"Boyfriend of 7 years likes his co-worker, and is persuing her outside of work. Help.","Boyfriend 32, whom I have known since we were both in fifth grade together, (I too am 32. Our birthdays are a week apart), and have been dating for 7 years after many years of being such good friends, is pursuing his co-worker. 

He would always get so defensive of her if I were to ask why she blocked me on Facebook, when I have never met her yet she works with my boyfriend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and goes to the dog park together, unbeknownst to me. Found that one out by finding a video clip of her on his phone at dog park. 

Then I started working at same company, and happened to walk past her in the cafeteria area for employees, and she went out of her way to not even look at me. As well as my co-workers, ( boyfriend and I work in different departments even though it's the same company), saying it seems like he is embarrassed of me or something, the way he never wants to hug me, or say love you have a great rest of your day when we do accidentally run into eachother in the hallways. 

Yesterday, March 12th he tells me all casual and nonchalant, "" oh I got my birthday off from work"", ( I should mention his birthday is March 17th, so he is now just letting me know, five days before his birthday, and about a week and a half too late for me to request off from work to be with him), so I reply very confused and offput, "" uhhhh, why are you just telling me this. I didnt realize you were going to take the entire day off, I would have too. He instantly quips back with, "" oh well you wouldn't have been able to anyways, you don't have enough time saved up. So I say back, "" what are you talking about, had you given me proper time as you know, you work there too, I could have just request the day off. By the way, that happens to be his co- workers day off.

Then came the major break, he fell asleep on my bed after basically agreeing with me that he's not in this anymore, ( whilst scrolling through his phone barely looking up as if I'm bothering him to be so concerned of the subject), so I looked at his messenger between him and her. WOW. He has been straight up saying to her, "" well if you need a viewing partner let me know"". Another occasion he says, ""you should invite me over to watch with you. I have insights, lol"". Another, she replies with, "" well my mom would probably have you watching cops with her"" he replies, "" I like cops. I'll watch that"". Then another time saying he would keep her company whilst she's out of work for surgery, even if it is just watching cops together"". 

He went out of town on his vacation to Ohio to see his nephew, and was messaging her pictures of him with the baby, and pictures of his sisters dog, and how they both just miss being at work :/ Mind you I NEVER ONCE RECEIVED OR HARDLY HEARD FROM HIM while he was gone, let alone pictures :( I always asked him if they talked, and he would say, "" I'm making shit up in my head, and that they only ever talk about work stuff. 

Needless to say, I woke him from his sleep, told him to please get his things and get going. He didn't even question me as to why I was asking him to leave. Am I tripping???? Help please.",relationship_advice
I [24F] am dating a [25M] an almost unreasonably picky eater and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope,"&#x200B;

TL;DR: My partner exclusively eats pizza.

&#x200B;

I \[24F\] met Jake \[25M\] about two years ago while out and bonding over the fact that we graduated from the same college. We went on a couple dates and were getting to know each other when he let me know that he had more or less eaten pizza every day for the past three years. I didn't love the idea but I thought he was pretty cool besides that and figured it was just a little quirk he had that he was, exaggerating and that the dude just really liked pizza.

&#x200B;

He was not.

&#x200B;

He eats it every single day without fail. Each time we go out, it has to be pizza and after a few fights here and there, it's been pretty much an unspoken understanding that when we go out we will be getting pizza. Also, it's not just ANY pizza, he's even picky about his pizza. He'll make us go to a few totally inconvenient pizza places that requires a subway ride trip and is far from where either of us live. We live in NYC and I'm sure most of you know you pretty much can't pass a single block without stumbling upon a pizza place, so it's not like these places are our ONLY options.

&#x200B;

I can name all the foods he eats on both my hands. All are simple carbohydrates, but pizza is his absolute favorite. The others he'll just settle to eat if pizza is not immediately available. No vegetables, no fruit, no protein, whatsoever. He absolutely refuses to even try them despite never trying most of them before. 

&#x200B;

I've tried to gently push his boundaries, but it always fails and the one time we went somewhere I wanted to go he pouted the entire time and ordered french fries. He's promised to be more open and that this pizza thing won't be forever, but that it's working for him now (whatever that means.) He claims to be high functioning on the spectrum which honestly, I'm not totally convinced of but that's another story, and that's why he can only eat pizza. This made me more cautious of discussing my issues with his diet because I know how easily he can claim I'm insensitive to his disability and that it's something he truly cannot help, and he has. I do firmly believe he has some sort of avoidant eating disorder, that is clearly not debatable.

&#x200B;

I've more or less dropped it because it always starts a fight, but the resentment is still there. Something I wasn't totally sold on when we first met but convinced myself was a small quirk is turning into genuine disgust and bitterness towards him and his unwillingness. I guess he thought I got over it since I stopped bringing it up as much, and he informed me of his plan to stop eating pizza everyday after 10,000 consecutive days of eating pizza. To do the math for you, that's roughly around 2040 factoring in the days he's already gained. He's going to document it on his instagram story and show everybody his ""streak."" 

&#x200B;

He seemed so proud of this idea and commitment and I'm genuinely stunned. He thinks this is just some interesting, cute little tidbit about him that people will support because ""he's such an offbeat guy."" I could not believe what I was hearing. Taking away the inconvenience of ALWAYS having to eat where he wants to eat, not being able to cook for us, me being bored stupid over eating the same shit every time, it's simply not healthy. He claims because he's outwardly fit it's not a big deal, but I disagree. 

&#x200B;

I was sort of putting up with the whole pizza thing at first but upon this announcement, I don't know if I can I deal with this much longer. It's inconvenient, it's unhealthy, and in my opinion it's selfish. Everybody you go to eat out with has to cater to a single person's self imposed dietary restrictions. He's going to Germany with his family for vacation and he's already mapped out the available pizza places he can eat at (german pizza over authentic german cuisine?!). It very well could be something he can't help, and he has claimed to be getting help through therapy with it but I'm seeing no progress and honestly I don't think he wants to and only says he's working on it to placate me. He talks about having a future with me and having kids, and there's no way I would even consider that if he continues to commit to this streak, for the fear of setting a bad example for our children's eating habits. 

&#x200B;

We don't live together and only see each other about three times a week and the pizza thing is driving me crazy. He proposed moving in together and I immediately shot that down for the time being. If I can barely handle it now I know living together would only amplify it.

&#x200B;

I've tried gently coaxing, I've tried showing him studies on how his diet affects his life and sets back the fitness goals he's always complaining about never reaching, I've tried fighting and anger only to be told I'm an asshole because I need to accept him as he is and that he can't help it. Maybe he is right. I have to accept it or I have to move on, and at this point I truly don't think I can. He's great in almost every other way except for this. I feel guilty for letting it go on this long when it bothered me from the very beginning, but I can't change that now. 

&#x200B;

Do I concede and let him eat whatever he wants as he's a grown man? Should I draw this boundary and continue to push him to push himself and give an ultimatum? Or do I just need to throw in the towel at this point and move on with my life? 

&#x200B;

My boyfriends birthday is today and he is mad that I didnt make a big deal about it. The only reason i didnt is because he told me not to.,"I have been asking him what he wanted for his birthday and he insisted that i dont have to get him anything. Yesterday i went to the music store because he said that he wanted a keyboard stand and i wanted to get him that. The only problem is that i didnt realize that the make and model matter when purchasing a stand. So i didnt get him that. 

I went to the music shop to pick out a cd for him instead but i wasnt sure which one to get.  I didnt get him a present. The next day hes upset because i didnt get him a present or even a card for his birthday. I feel terrible but he told me not to get him anything. 

I feel like i let him down and now hes really mad at me. Hes moping in his room and im on the couch in tears feeling like the worst girlfriend ever. How do i fix this?",relationship_advice
"[Update] What is the best gift that says, ""I know you are cheating.""","I apologise for the late update and I appreciate everyone's advice I received in the original post.

A little backstory first because I left it out of the original post.

Let's call my now ex-girlfriend Beth, I am myself, my roommate is Bruce.

Bruce and I have lived together for going on 4 years. Beth and I started talking about January 3 years ago. Beth lived in another state (I used to live there and that's how we met), and we talked for a year before deciding it was time to move her up here. There is more opportunity and overall a better quality of life. She moved up here and everything seemed fine. She got a job and started making friends. 

Well Bruce and I's lease was up Dec. 31st. Beth and I started looking for places to finally call our own. We found pretty much the perfect place. 

This is where things start to falter a little. A few days around Thanksgiving I've noticed her texting non-stop all day long. Which isn't necessarily out of the ordinary since she has several group chats with her friends up here and back home. The part that really stood out to me was the she was laying next to me texting a number that wasn't saved in her phone, at 1:30 in the morning. I ask who she is talking to and she says her friends and Mike. I'm curious as to who Mike is because it's not one of the friends she normally mentions and she says she works with him.

Fast forward a few days and I have to get up early to open my store. I go to swap the phone charger from my phone to hers and when I do, her backlight lights up and shows a message from this unsaved number saying ""Hey beautiful, I just got home.."" this definitely peaks my curiosity.

I'm off the next day and she works early in the morning, so I stayed up and drank while she went to bed early. About 3am my drunken curiosity gets the better of me and I go grab her phone and head to the bathroom. She had basically been lying for a couple of weeks about them hanging out and cuddling and saying that she felt more chemistry with him than anyone else.

I was taken back and I was hurt. I waiting another couple days and did it again. This time Beth was talking shit on my roommate Bruce. She was making plans to go to ""zoo lights"" for a date with Mike and his friends. She was telling him how she would have left earlier in the year but didn't want to screw me on the lease. She was just going to suffer through being with me for a few more months and basically set it up for this guy to ""wait"" while they discussed when they could hang out around my work schedule.

Her and I were still planning on getting that place too. We had signed the lease, paid the deposit, and we were just waiting to take control of the property. The next morning after reading through her messages. I went down to the apartments we we're going to get and I asked them to cancel our contract. Since we hadn't taken possession of the property they were able to cancel it and keep the holding fees we paid. In order to cancel it, they needed both parties to confirm the cancellation. So they had to call her and ask if that's what she really wanted to do. I ran into an issue here of ""how do I cancel this without letting her know that I know she is cheating?""

So I lied. I called and told her I found a place for 3/4 the price and was closer to my job and would save us a ton of money in the next few months. She said it sounded like a good idea and I convinced her to agree to cancel the new lease when they called her.

I had to wait because my boss throws a spectacular Christmas party every year and he had already purchased everything for her to be my +1. This party was on a Sunday and I almost ruined everything by being impatient. The Saturday before the party she went out with friends (which I've never had a problem with) and then she decided to ghost me for the night. Which she knew would piss me off and was well in her intentions. So instead of confronting her then, I went to Mike's house (his address was in the messages they sent back and forth) and I put the ""Love Book"" I made her for Christmas last year into his mailbox. I then drove to my job and slept on the floor of the office. Bruce sent me a message at 4am saying she had just gotten home.

My plan here wasn't for him to find it until he checked the mail on Monday, my plan didn't work out. My assumption is that a neighbor saw me put it in the mailbox and gave him a heads up. (Because who checks the mail on Sunday) But Beth texted me that Sunday morning after a little bit asking why I would go to Mike's and give him her book. I know that she knows at this point and basically ask her what possible reason I could have for doing such a thing. Her response was basically ""well what do you want to do about it?"" And I told her let's make it through the night, have fun at the party, and we would discuss everything the next day. 

We had fun at the party, went to a comedy show, followed by dinner at a nice restaurant. Everything went fine, my coworkers knew but we're on their best behaviors about it. She could tell something was up, she messaged one of her friends saying that she thinks everyone knows and is judging her. They did know and they were judging her.

We go home and she goes to bed because she has to be up early for work and I set the rest of my plan in motion. I slept in the recliner and after she left for work that morning I drove down and picked up the Uhaul I had set up for us to move into our new place and I loaded up all of my big stuff and took it to storage. She came home, realized what I had done, look her cat and left to a friend's house.

Beth basically says she will be back in the next few days to get her stuff. So the weekend before Christmas comes around and she is waiting until that Sunday while I'm at work to get the rest of her stuff. I tell her to hang out at the house because we need to talk and figure it all out. So she is there Sunday and is doing laundry waiting for me to get off work. 

I come in and I just start helping her fold laundry. I ask if her cat is enjoying her friends house. Just small talk. After folding laundry we go to the living room where I set up my smaller than because I'm still in the house for a few days and want to play games. As I'm rummaging through wires, I tell her that I'm glad she has a place to go and will be taken care of. She says she is glad for the same thing for me. I scoffed and told her I was basically homeless because of this whole situation and she asks about the other apartment. I just tell her I lied, there was no apartment, it was the only way to get her to cancel the lease we were going to have. She sits in silence for a moment then goes to the bedroom and starts crying. I wait a few minutes and hear the dryer finish. Her last load of laundry is done. I grab it and help her fold it and put it in some boxes. I help her out with her stuff. She comes in to make sure she has everything and as she leaves I tell her to drive safe and shut the door behind her.

Now the second phase of my plan was the scrapbook that she had made me that was full of our pictures and concert memorabilia. I was going to wrap it and drop it off at Mike's on Christmas with the note that says ""if she cheats on me, she'll cheat on you."" BUT clarity hit me and before she could pull out and leave I ran out with the scrapbook I had hidden away and knocked on her car window. She rolled it down and I place the scrapbook in on her seat. She said that she made that for me, I can keep it. I just looked at her and said, ""I was going to give it to Mike, but I've already been enough of an asshole. They are your memories, you keep them."" and I went back inside.

I spent the last week of December working and using what spare time I had to move the rest of my stuff to storage and clean the apartment before the lease was up.
I'm currently on a friend's couch, but have found an apartment in her complex that the landlord said I could have on the 15th.

Beth and I are done. I love her but I can't trust her. I watched her lie to my face for about a month. She knew what she was doing and didn't feel guilty about it until she was caught. I'm just going to move on. Take some time to make myself a better person. Lose all of the weight I gained while her and I were together. Get active again. Find hope again.

Thank you to all of the Redditors who gave sound advice and an even bigger thanks to those who wanted to help me be petty. You guys really cheered me up with your gift suggestions and got me through a tough time with the laughs. ",relationship_advice

LAST UPDATE my ex girlfriend spent the night at a random guys house and FaceTimed me in the morning eating breakfast with him in bed,"Probably the last update since I'm not changing my mind and that's it. A ton of people are asking so sorry for those who think I'm going on too much about it 

She took an early flight and is back in New York. Of course all her friends were texting me saying she's innocent and didn't do anything and I better forgive her and not break her heart ""or else"" (as if these 5' girls are gonna attack me or something. fr bitch.. cmon. Am I the only who hates when girls say shit like this lol) and that I'm overreacting. And she came to my fucking house and of course, my mom let her in and I told her i didn't wanna see her and she wasn't listening and just cried to my mom saying I broke up with her for no reason and making me seem like the bad guy so I told my mom that she spent the night at a random guys house and was in his bed in the morning. Yeah that was embarrassing to tell my mom our business and it got messy but she was acting so innocent and she's the one who came crying and shit all dramatic. Anyway my mom was just trying to get her to calm down but I left bc I hate bullshit like that 

Currently at Panera bread eating a Tom moz panini and half lemonade half green tea. waiting for my brother to text me that she left our house. He told me she is still crying to my mom and saying she didn't do anything. Yeah unfortunately I am done with her, that's it, no more chances. I just wanna go home wtf. 

anyway thanks for everyone's advice. You guys are the best and i appreciate all the messages I got. I will not waste anymore time on her

Tbh I am a very passionate guy, I would never cheat on a girl or mistreat her. When I make a girl my girlfriend, like another comment said, that means she's a potential wife. I don't take that shit lightly. I love intensely and with all my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. And I'm sure a girl is out there who wants a guy who is obsessed with the relationship like I am lol. If I love a girl, I am all hers but I refuse to be disrespected and stepped on like what the fuck. Spending the night at some random Jersey Shore Pauly D lookin ass guy's bed and then crying to my mf MOTHER that I dumped her for no reason?? That shit was embarrassing, my fucking dog got in the middle and was staring like ""wtf some shit is going on, I have to see this."" Got damn. First of all I would never even go on a vacation without my girlfriend, what's the point. that shit is boring. Drinking and dancing at a club and then going to an empty hotel room alone while everyone else is hooking up , how the fuck is that even fun, I'd need my girl there to have some fun with. That's like torture, not a vacation. Idk anyway I'm fucking over it

I [28M] think my girlfriend [26F] of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.,"I saw their messages last week and I haven't been the same since. 

I borrowed her old iPad for work purposes and her Facebook account was still logged in the device. I was going to log in on my messenger because I forgot my phone at home and I was going to message her but then I saw that she had messages from her ex-boyfriend. Let's call him Andre. 

Her and Andre dated for two years. They were each other's first love and she never told me what happened between them. I met her a year and some months after they broke up when I went on a trip with my family to California. 

I didn't know anything about him other than the fact that they dated sometime in high school and college.

When I met her, we instantly hit it off, she showed me around LA and me living in Australia wasn't a problem. We were in a long distance relationship for a year until I saved up enough money to move out of my country for her. Other than that, it took me months to look for a job in Los Angeles so that I would be financially secure when I got there.

Three years later, we're still going strong. Or so I thought.

When I clicked on their conversation out of curiousity, I immediately noticed the kiss and heart emojis. Right then I knew what was happening. I don't wanna go on about the details but the only message that stood out was her talking about leaving me for a few months so that she could take care of him. He has cancer, it's at stage 1 but he reckons he's going to die. On one of his messages to her, he asked if she would visit him in his house.

And I'm pretty sure she did because they mentioned how they had a great time together and that it was good to catch up. 

Well, it's been a week since I found out. She doesn't know that I know, or that I took her old iPad out of its box and that I had spent two days reading their messages. She has no idea at all.

She thinks everything is okay between us but I actually want to cry for a long time and that I want to physically hurt myself. I have no friends in LA, all of them are back home and they're all living their own lives now. I don't wanna talk about it to anyone because thinking too deeply about it hurts. 

I guess when it all comes down to it, she never really loved me and I'm still trying to accept that. 

I don't know how to approach this. I have written my resignation letter for work and I have messaged my parents that I was going to go home sometime next month. I did both when I was extremely upset. 

I just need advice on how to approach this. I don't wanna talk to her about it, at all. I can't even look her in the eye without wanting to break down. Please help me on what to do and how to approach it correctly. As of now, I'm thinking of leaving while she's at work. ",relationship_advice
"[Update] My wife (30F) says I (30M) am unreasonable to ask for adjustments to the ""core of who she is"" for the sake of our marriage.","Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbydc3/my_wife_30f_says_i_33m_am_unreasonable_to_ask_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I'll try to keep this as short as I can!

So, over the weekend we talked much more calmly about some of the stuff that I approached her about. I started off by apologizing for the way I phrased my wants, but also said that just because I was an asshole in the way I handled it doesn't change that those wants still exist. She acknowledged that it is definitely fair to want the relationship to passionate and exciting after being together for  five years.

We came to some of the following agreements:

1. Exercise/physical challenging activities together - she confessed that she can't get back into going to the gym because she associates the gym/working out with ten years of her life where she was forced to work out, constantly told she wasn't good enough/needed to be better, and being yelled at by coaches in high school and college. Turns out this aversion is something a lot of athletes deal with, which is news to me. I started looking into physical activities we can do together and we're planning to try some different things. We have an indoor rock climbing date planned for this week, which we are both excited about.

2. Effort into date night - I backtracked big time on the ""make up and be more fun and exciting"" thing and said that I was a total jerk for saying that and it's not what I meant. I used a horrible example there. I explained in a little more detail that I basically wanted to feel more like she wanted me to be attracted to her. She agreed that it was unfair for her to pull up after work on date nights and just have me run out to the car so we can get to the restaurant and chow down. We will both be putting more effort into date nights. I will do a better job of picking new and fun places to try. She will be more open to trying new things and spend some time after work getting ready. Which brings us to the last point...

3. Her work hours - she didn't realize the toll it was taking on our relationship that she was exhausting herself at work. She said that she will make a bigger effort to leave by 4:30 going forward and to go in less on the weekends. Which will leave more time for us do  things together, even if it's as simple as relaxing by the pool.

I didn't mention the sex stuff. I'm hoping that if these changes stick, that will naturally result in a more passionate sex life.

I ended by asking if there was anything she wanted from me and that she didn't have to respond now. She said she will take some time to think about that, as she hasn't even thought about anything like that lately.

Thanks everyone for the advice and I'm excited to see where our relationship goes from here!

More happy update:

She's currently planning a date for us for the weekend, which is a trip to tequilafest in our local Downtown. This is something so literally beyond anything she's ever shown an interest in that I'm totally floored lol. Sorry I'm not trying to brag just really excited. And I understand that she's probably not interested in tequila, but that she's doing it to make an effort to do stuff together.",relationship_advice
My fiance (24M) cheated on me (F23) 2 months before we were supposed to get married.,"A lot of people advised me not to get married this young but i didn't listen to them. I told them how we were in it for the long haul and us getting married is just a way to secure our relationship and make it stronger. 

I've been with this guy for 5 years now. Ever since I was 18. Our relationship had its ups and downs but was fairly strong. We didn't fight that much and usually resolved our problems before going to bed. 

He popped the question 8 months ago in our anniversary and I was so ecstatic that I immediately called my friends and family. I was confused as to why my father wasn't as happy as I expected him to be about this news. I later learned that he didn't think I should get married yet and that i should maybe wait a little longer. 

I was so in love with this man that I didn't listen to my dad's advice. I later announced that I'd get married this upcoming March.  

Everything went ok and me and my SO were really happy about everything. We were going to move into a bigger place and he even got promoted . We didn't have any problems whatsoever.  He was affectionate and didn't act different or cold towards me. 

Until one day he got home later than usual because he went to a work party. I didn't really think much of it.  I thought that he deserved a break since he was working a lot lately. 

The next day, he acted very strangely. Even when I simply hugged him, he didn't hug me back. I, again didn't think anything of it and just thought that he might be stressed out because of work ( stupid I know ). 

He usually uses my laptop because he broke his own. So when I found his Facebook page open, I don't know what made me want to snoop around even though usually I don't. 

I found very explicit messages between him and this girl that he works with. I kept scrolling to a month ago and saw how they were meeting when I wasn't home  and  were having sex. I even saw a selfie with the girl and him in bed. To say I was heart broken was an understatement. All those late nights that he spent ""working"" , he was apparently with her.

The sad thing about this whole situation is that we were getting married after two months. He could've at least told me that this didn't work for him anymore instead of letting me plan our wedding while also working and having to go on work trips often. 

I was sleeping 3h a day so I can juggle all of that while also trying to maintain a social life.

I confronted him and after a yelling match, he confessed that he's been with her for 3 months.  3 FREAKING MONTHS. While I was working my ass off and being freaking sleep deprived. 

I told him that I couldn't continue my life with a cheater. And he cried and told me that it wasn't serious and that he loved me. 

I left the house because I knew that I was so weak that I would probably take him back because I truly love him.  4 days later and I am currently at my dad's house. He still calls and texts me daily and I ignored all of them because I know that I'm currently very emotional and that he could take advantage of that. 

What I hate the most is the mask that I have to put on whenever I Go to work. The fake smiles. 

I don't know what to do. No one knows about this except for my dad and my best friends. What I hate the most is having to tell everyone that the wedding is off. I can't even think about that.

My life is so intertwined with this guy. I don't know how to get over him or over the fact that my  wedding dress is sitting in my closet and I'll never get to wear it. 5 years gone to waste. Really great. 

I know at this point, my wedding is probably off. But it's so hard for me to understand that. I've been working hard to make this happen. Yesterday I slept for 12h for the first time in so long just because i was so angry.  

I am sorry for the long post. I am just trying to vent and this is the only way I can do it. 

TL;DR  my fiance cheated on me two months before our wedding and I am devastated.",relationship_advice
I (21 M) am unsure whether to breakup with my girlfriend (21 F) over marriage concerns,"I'll try and keep this short, or as short as is possible with these kind of things.

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for ~ 2 years now, we complement each other well and are very loved up. Our relationship has had its peaks and troughs, as is normal with any, but there's always been this wholesome, unfettering love through thick and thin. 

We've always talked about longevity and our future in a sort of daydreamy way. However, recently it's become more of a serious conversation and it's quickly transpired that it's very unlikely that we will be ""together forever"".

The crux of the issue is that we are different religions. I'm not a religious person really so I don't really care, but she feels her religion is a strong part of her identity (although she is not that religious herself) and has made it clear that she wants to raise her kids as such (and will not compromise on this). 

The problem with this is that my parents are very religious and my relationship would never be the same with them if I did raise my kids like that. It would ruin them, to be frank. The only people I love more than my girlfriend are my parents (and my brother), so estranging myself from them isn't something I'd consider really.

She recognises all this, and accepts that it's highly unlikely we will be together forever— i.e. it's not impossible but it is extremely improbable. 

The issue I'm having is that despite the fact that we are so young (with marriage being at least 5+ years away), I don't know how I could stay with someone that I was probably only going to be with temporarily? Her viewpoint is that we should value the time we have together, as much as it may be, and make the most of it, together - even if we only have a couple of years she has made it clear she'd much rather take that over nothing since she loves me so much.


I, on the other hand, am really having trouble reconciling/justifying a temporary relationship in my mind. I wish I thought like her, I really do, since it would make things so much easier. 

Realistically, at 21, marriage talk is so early, but most couples will assume there is a decent ish chance they will stay together forever, rather than thinking eh I expect this to last a couple more years then we'll probably break up. 




TL:DR

Boy and girl have religious differences meaning marriage is likely impossible. Girl wants to stay with boy for as long as she can despite this, boy not sure if he can stay if relationship is likely only temporary.



I'm at a loss for what to do, could anyone provide some advice? It would be much much appreciated.

I've slowly been making my way through all the replies, giving each careful thought and consideration - I appreciate every single one of them and will get to replying to them as I can.

I just wanted to clarify that once I am married I plan on loving my wife and children more than anyone else in the world, my family will be my number one priority.",relationship_advice
Trigger warning. I don't know what to do. Initially consensual sex became nightmare.,"I went to a coworkers party tonight and got very drunk. It seemed like a very safe environment. Another coworker and I were flirting hard (after months of sexual tension) and he asked me to come to the bathroom with him where we kinda fooled around but not really because I felt super uncomfortable about it. He asked me what sexual things I like. I felt silly but I told him, which included that I like to be submissive. We talked about other things and left the bathroom.

We get an uber and leave together. I remember that, and I remember when we started to have sex. And then everything got bad.

He asked to have anal with me. I said no. 

He wouldn't stop asking. And then he had his hands deep in my hair and was pulling super hard, he was slapping me without asking and on my face, choking, and all the while wanted to penetrate me anally. I kept saying no. A few times he tried to pretend to mishear me when he said ""where to you want it?"" 

As I rejected him, he'd get more forceful. He choked more, and I became truly scared, like he was drunk enough to really hurt me, choke me too long.... He finally put me on him, held me tight, holding my head tight against his, and said ""you are going to do this"". When he did it, he pulled my hair super hard, and made me say ""yes, sir"". He didn't use lube.

From that point forward I had no choice. I felt more scared than I ever have and I just did what he wanted and hoped he'd just finish and stop. The bed was covered in my hair, he pulled so much of it out. He didn't end up orgasming.

He fell asleep abruptly but it took me a little time to be brave enough to make a run for it. I left his place as quietly as I could and got an uber home. The first thing I did was write here.

He's a super well liked person in our company and I think he'd be believed over me because I'm newer and he didn't cum so I can't do a rape kit and the first part of our sexual interaction was consensual. 

I think this was rape, but I don't think I can do anything now but get a new job. I never want to see him again.",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

Throwaway, first time poster, English not first language, tldr at the end, blabla... I am 21

We've been together for 4 years. At the beginning, like all teenagers do, we also fooled around, she was genuinely turned on and wanted to do stuff but we never got to penetration. We were both virgin and to her, virginity was always the best thing she can give me, it's ""the only thing she can give only to me in the whole life"" and to be honest, that's why I\[21m\] didn't push for it at all and wanted the take her pace.

Around 2-2.5 years ago, things started to cool down. She no longer wanted to do it(referring to touching and oral) as often and a year ago she started pushing away even though I would ask twice a month when I was sexually frustrated. I really loved her, and I still do, and I think she is smart, intelligent and beautiful and that's why that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Two weeks after our 4 years mark, she said she felt trapped and that she wanted to take a little break from our relationship. I was crushed because I didn't see this coming at all. Her ""trapped"" definition was that she felt bad going to concerts and doing stuff without inviting me, and to be honest, I always encouraged her to go with her girlfriends and have fun, I have a feeling she trapped herself? I think she just wanted to take a break and couldn't come up with a better reason or the real reason was offending to me or she just lost attraction although she denied it. We talked it through and we decided that we will take a break and she will call me once the break is over. She was supposed to move in with me in may.

It took a toll on me, I performed bad at my work and I was distant from my family, I was crushed and I hoped she would come back and that we would cry together, agree it was a mistake and move on.

Well, after around 3 weeks, she messaged me and said she wanted to talk. I was so excited and I invited her to my house. When she arrived, shortly after, she basically broke down crying, saying she met a guy\[23m\] 2 weeks ago and that after 3 days they slept together. She said she tried to connect with him but it wasn't nearly as fun as with me and that she wasn't sure why she wanted to take a break from me in the first place. Now, I consider myself 7-8/10, I am tall and work out semi-regularly. She assured me that it wasn't my looks. She said she wanted us to be together again and that she would do anything to earn back my trust and make me happy. The guy she slept with was 10/10 and a lot of muscle, although I didn't know him or anything about him.

This happened yesterday. I am broken. I couldn't come up with words and just said it's gonna be okay and later politely asked her to leave so I have time and space to think. I can't help it but feel like a backup plan, she sacrificed our 4 years together and basically made me a fool for waiting for sex and thinking that I am something special for her. It bothers me so much that she was ready to fuck some guy, less than a week after we broke up. Even if we get back together, am I supposed to have sex with her now or what...

I will provide more information if needed, but I am really struggling for some advice on what to do.

My [28/m] mother in law [55/f] opened up several credit cards in my wife's [28/f] name and now we can't buy a house.,"Pretty short and sweet but my mother-in-law has completely screwed us out of a chance to buy a house in the next year or two. After 3 years of saving up money for a big down payment, furniture, etc. we've now learned my wife's credit is in the toilet because her mom defaulted on 3 credit cards two years ago. When my wife confronted her about it, she kept saying she was sorry but she was going through a tough time. She's offered to pay the entire amount (around $3000) back in a lump sum but that doesn't erase the bad credit score. She has also asked my wife not to bring it up to her siblings. It just seems like shes aloof about this whole situation. Is there anything that can be done to make her realize how much she has screwed us over?

I [22F] just found out my boyfriend [27F] has been having sex with me when I'm sleeping after I've taken sleeping pills.,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsfbde/update_i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27m_has/)

My boyfriend and I have been together for a couple of years now. Our sex life is good. I have no complaints. Don't think he does either. We sleep together multiple times a week. I hardly ever refuse him when he initiates because I have quite a high sex drive.  I rarely refuse him because I'm not in the mood. 

I do occasionally say no because I have Insomnia and occasionally take medication. The medications knock me out so hard that you could probably do surgery on me and I wouldn't wake up. Because of this, if I have taken my meds I'll not sleep with him because of the reaction I have. I wouldn't want to fall asleep on him.

Well a couple of days ago I was feeling unwell and did refuse him. I went to sleep and all was well until I was awoken about an hour later with my boyfriend inside me and kissing my neck. I went into panic at first because I didn't realize it was him and I felt a little trapped.

When I asked what he was doing his response was that he thought I had taken my meds. When I asked again he admitted that he has done it before and didn't think it was a big deal because we have woken each other up with oral sex before (I will add that we have pretty much ongoing consent that either of us can wake the other up with oral sex in the mornings). I explicitly told him no before I went to to sleep. I was shocked and still am a little rattled.

He still doesn't think it's a big deal because I wasn't awake for it. He thinks I'm overreacting. But to me, if he thought it was okay then he would have outright told me he had one it the first time he did it. The fact that he's done it multiple time just doesn't sit right with me. And the fact that he pretty much waited until I drugged myself to do it as well. It makes me feel a little icky and gross. I can't describe it.

I don't know what to say to him. Any advice?

TL;DR I have Insomnia so have to take meds to help me sleep. These meds knock me out so hard that I'm pretty much dead to the world. While I've been drugged my boyfriend has been sleeping with me, even after I explicitly told him no before I fell asleep he thinks it's no big deal and that I'm overreacting.",relationship_advice

My GF likes me to go by different names.,"To make this a bit easier to read, my name is Jason.

My GF and I have been together for 1 year and for the past 6 months we've done a mini vacation at least once a month. We go to another city usually within a 5 hour drive for the weekend and rent the most expensive hotel room we can afford. This usually leads to the wildest sex because we don't know anyone there. In the past 4 months we've gone on 5 mini vacations and every time she wanted me to go by a different name. 

It's always been the same name, Matt Blank. I figured this was just a fantasy name and went along with it. She's done things with Matt that she's never done with Jason. Matt took her anal virginity and deep throat ""virginity"". If I bring it up to her that Jason want to try those things with her, she says she's not that type of girl. 

She's pretty vanilla when we are at home, which I won't complain about. I never needed to have anal sex or be deep throated but now that I know it's an option I feel like I'm missing out. 

Here's the kicker, I had to pick her up from work a few days ago and walked into her office to look for her. This was the first time I had been to her office. I spoke to the secretary to ask where she was and started on my way there. As we were leaving, her coworkers came to introduce themselves to me. From down the hall I see this guy coming towards all of us and he says something along the lines of, ""Hi I'm Matt Blank, SVP of marketing"".

After we finished talking to everyone we went to the car I waited for her to say something but she never did. I don't know what to say to her or if there is anything to say. I feel really uncomfortable and I see our mini vacations in a completely different light now. Is this something I should be worried about or is it normal?

TL;DR: I've been fucking my GF using her bosses bosses name.

How do I tell my sister I don't want my unvaccinated nieces to visit my newborn?,"So a little bit of pretext, I live several states away from my family so seeing them is far and few between. In January I found out I was pregnant after losing twins last year, so my family is ecstatic to say the least. My sister and her husband are going through some financial struggles so I understand it's difficult to make a trip to visit, so it came as a shock when she suggested the other day, they wanted to plan a trip up here when the baby is born. The problem is she's an anti vaxxer. 

I have two nieces, 7 and 4, who haven't gotten a single vaccine in their life. I love my sister dearly, but she firmly believes in the hype surrounding their dangers, along with many beliefs with western medicine. They have no health insurance and when the kids are sick, she takes them to a chiropractor. Every food must be gluten free, organic, natural, because, without testing, she just ""knows"" her children have egg, dye, and gluten allergies. Ironically she's also a massive germaphobe, keeping her kids homeschooled. My point is not to knock her, my point is to stress how much of a lifestyle this whole thing is and therefore not as easy as just saying she does one thing but not the other. She is a full 100% on board with the term ""vegan crunchy granola mom"". 

Last year she talked about coming up alone to visit my twins which wasn't a problem (we were vaccinated as children) but now her mentioning bringing up the kids when my baby is about 2-3 months old and therefore not up to date with shots, is sadly not an option. I was scared before but now with the measles making a comeback I'm even more freaked out and don't know how to word this. 

I know she's going to be offended and I know she's going to be upset but this is not an option nor is it up for debate. She chooses to believe in not vaccinating but my husband and I firmly believe in science and medicine and after losing two children I'll be damned if I put another child in harm's way. Any advice on how I can word this to soften the blow would be very much appreciated. Like I said, this is not a negotiation and it's a firm no they can't come up but I'm sure there's a better way to word this than, ""I'm terrified your children are going to kill mine.""

Update: Thank you so much to everyone who commented and left suggestions on how to proceed with this! I had the talk with my sister and while keeping it courteous but not personal, she was very understanding to my concern. Ironically, she was nervous about the notion of being around my child once he/she *was* vaccinated as she believes the vaccine can shed and therefore infect her kids (but that's another story!) It ended on a good note with no bloodshed with her respecting waiting until my baby is good and vaccinated. Thank you again to everyone, this was quite the success story!",relationship_advice

I have no idea if anyone cares about the outcome of this situation but it is almost cathartic to write it all down so i'm doing it anyway. I finally have a calm moment to sit at my computer and compose a logical thought.

Upon me returning home he and I had very little communication at my request. I had originally planned to spend the week at my friend's home to process this life altering event but early this afternoon he texted me telling me he was home. Now, some people might think that shows a lot of effort on his part, that he's remorseful and rather than enjoy his vacation he flew home to talk. Perhaps I would feel that way too except I asked for space. I told him that if he had ever loved me he would give me time alone. He couldn't even give me that.

I agreed to meet with him at our apartment to talk. I only wanted to talk about and sort out all the details. Our finances, home, etc. We agreed on paying to break our lease, to stay on the insurance policy and phone plan together for now but unenroll auto pay so we're able to make our payments separately. I also asked for him to reimburse me for what I paid towards the vacation from hell. I wanted to wrap things up enough in that moment to where I would have to see and speak to him as little as possible. I know that some communication in the future will be inevitable but right now I can't deal with it. I told him he can stay in our apartment until we have to leave. I packed some more of my things and left.

I don't know if he looked upset or if he was crying. I honestly barely heard anything he had to say because I was so enraged at the person in front of me, a complete stranger. I don't know if the past 3 years were all a lie, I don't know if he has cheated before or that he would cheat on me again. All I am sure of is that he was capable of lying and cheating now. I refuse to be another cautionary tale of a woman who loved someone more than herself so she forgave a cheater only to be cheated on again.

There is a big difference between guilt and remorse.",relationship_advice
My (20M) girlfriend (19F) won't stop calling me Onii-chan during sex,"I'm sorry if this is long, but I have a lot on my plate right now. I'm using an old, shitty account from like 3 years ago for this because I don't want this to become a permanent stain on my main one.


So before I get into the meat (heh) of things, I want to provide a little context first.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months, and recently we've started to have sex for the first time ever. We're both our firsts. I'm a mixed black and white dork standing at 6'1 while she's a pale, short dork standing at 5'4. She's always been a bit shy but that's probably what attracts me to her the most. I really want her to open up to me about anything and everything. Her interests, her anxieties, her desires, etc. I just want her to be honest with me while I do the same for her. I don't think either of us want to have some sort of surprise secret coming out of nowhere in the coming years, so it's best to be open early on. We're both looking for something long term and exclusive, likely to get married and settle, and possibly have a kid or two.


But there's one thing that's been bugging both of us lately.


Keep in mind that neither of us have any sort of Asian ancestry whatsoever. That's going to be important for later, probably.


About a month ago we played a fun, harmless game of truth or dare. We didn't do anything stupid, just talked about some of the interesting things that have happened in our lives so far. I asked her if she ever kissed a girl before. She said no but she did actually touch lips with a girl when she ran into her in elementary. Good, my girlfriend is straight. We laughed it off, I called her a dopy little klutz, harmless fun and games, right? Then the next question.


Have you ever watched hentai?


Now she's a big anime fan. Me, not so much. I would consider myself a very basic anime fan. I grew up watching DBZ and that's pretty much it. I've seen Akira, Cowboy Bebop, FMA:B, and a couple others on my own terms. But sometimes we watch anime together, and she's into some shit I've never heard of before. But again, it's all harmless and just for fun.


I told her yes, I have watched hentai before, but mostly as an experiment to see if I actually like it. I kinda did, kinda didn't. A lot of it is very rape-y and I like my porn to be more wholesome. I told her this and she says that she watches hentai semi-frequently. She told me she's glad that she was finally able to tell someone this. I'm glad that someone was me.


Fast forward to a week ago.


We decided to bump bellies for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. We do a bunch of twists and turns and all is well. But then she hits me with this:


A ""Yes, Onii-chan!""


At that moment, I tried to internally solve this with advanced algebra and calculus and shit. By the time I solve the Pythagorean Theorem of this angle she's as red as a tomato. She realized what she just said and starts breaking down crying.

For the next half hour I get her to calm down and told her that it was completely okay. People let things slip during sex all the time, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Harmless.


I take her home, tell her everything is going to be okay, and go about my night peacefully. She texts me the next day saying it won't happen ever again. Great. We both agree that our first time didn't count since neither of us got our socks rocked off.


Fast forward to last night.


We're rockin' and a-boppin' all night long, and again, it's fantastic. This time I got to ult and now it's her turn. I go to town down there and she hits me with another one of these:

""Right there Onii-chan.""


I unplug my lips from hers and what do I see again? Another cherry tomato. At this point we're both visibly frustrated. I take her home again, but this time I don't get a text.


I've never known what Onii-chan actually meant, just that it's used in hentai a lot, so I decided to look it up this morning. Apparently it means ""older brother"" in Japanese. So I'm connecting the dots and have come to the conclusion that she's watched so much hentai that it's started to affect our relationship. I don't want to leave her. She's cute, sweet, and we play Switch together. No one plays Switch with me.

My question now is, does she want tall, dark, and kinda handsome? Or does she want Onii-chan? Does she want me to RP as her older brother, or does she want me to go 2D like Paper Mario?


tl;dr My gf has called me Onii-chan twice now and it's looking like there's no end in sight. I am absolutely perplexed on what my next move should be. Help me out please.

FINAL UPDATE: The fiancé (33) of my mom (34) raped my sister (14).,"A lot has happened in the past few days and I'll try to explain what I can.

On Thursday last week, I decided to tell my stepfather (my sisters' biological father) about the situation. He made the right call and contacted DCF while I was at work, and they sent a social worker over. Once my shift finished, I went outside to wait for my mom. At this point, I didn't know a social worker was at the house, and was curious why she was taking so long. 

After about 10 minutes, she pulls up really fast in the parking spot, almost hitting me. I get up quickly and she tells my 12 year old sister to stay in the car. She starts walking towards me and asks ""What the fuck were you thinking?"". From then on, all I heard was just a flurry of insults from my mother as she described how horrible of a person I was and how I was going to ruin their lives. She personally blamed me for all of the upcoming hardships they were going to have, and how I would likely be the cause of Kyle commiting suicide. She tells me I'm not going to tell the social worker anything at all. A few minutes later, Kyle starts texting my mom, apparently saying his goodbyes. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently he's had a gun with bullets all this time. My mom starts breaking down and tries to text and call him, but she gets no response. She got in the car and started slamming her head against the steering wheel, asking ""What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and ""How could you do this to us?"". She then blames me for his death, and yells at me to ""Get the fuck in the car."" By the point, my 12 year old sister is crying and I'm frozen in fear, and oblige.

The ride home, which normally takes 10 minutes, took closer to five. She was speeding and driving erratically, continuing to berate me the entire way home. She states that she has nothing to live for now, and she should just kill herself too. This just makes my sister bawling, and she starts begging my mom not to do it. About halfway, I assume she got a text from Kyle, and started calming down and told my sister to wipe away her tears for the social worker. I was texting my Dad the whole time and relaying info to him, all the while he was on the phone with the social worker. We pull up to my house and I see the social worker's car parked on the driveway. As we pull in, my mom makes me promise not to say anything, and to play dumb. I make the promise, knowing full well I'm gonna break it in the next minute.

The social worker tells me that she received a report that sexual abuse had occurred at the house. I start telling her the story, but she then tells me to wait, as she requested a police officer to come on scene and she doesn't want me repeating myself. Once he shows up, I tell both of them what had happened, and I see more cops arriving on scene. I tell them that Kyle has a gun with ammo, and who resides in the house and where they are so they can get everyone out safely. Once they get things going, I ask if I can be taken away from the house while this happens to talk more with the social worker, and she obliges, taking me down the road in her car. I give her the full story, and she reassures me it was the right thing to do, and that it was brave. A couple police officers also come by the car and tell me the same thing.

A couple hours later, a detective arrives at the scene and brings me into his car to record my explanation of the entire situation. I swear under oath that everything I say is true and it goes by smoothly. I also provide them the pictures I've taken of the evidence, and let them know that the phone with the audio is inside. Later that night, the cops start bringing our backpacks (which are then filled with clothes) to the social worker's car. Not too long after that, my Dad pulls up with his wife in their car. He said he was proud of me for what I'd done. My sisters are also released to us, and we are told to meet up at a nearby gas station for more questioning. 

The night lasts a long while. By the time we get done with all the questions, it was around 5 AM, and I got some much needed sleep at my dad's house. As of right now, my sisters and I are finishing our last week of school, and we're living with our dad until further notice. There is a legal no contact order for two weeks between us and our mom and Kyle, or any 2nd or 3rd parties. 

We are safe, and I'm glad for that fact. The court should be making a decision soon, and we should be going to grab our things later on.",relationship_advice
UPDATE : Not sure how to deal with my 37F Antivaxx Husband 35M,"Original post:

Well guys, I did it last week. I started vaccines.

I took them to our county medical office on a day that accepted walk-ins, we waited and they got the first round, about 4 combos each, with another walk-in suggested to me for 3-6 months to catch up the rest.

They cried so hard! The oldest kept crying off and on for an hour afterwards, so I took them to a Chick-fil-A for ice cream and playing to distract them. I took the bandaids off before we returned so my husband didn't notice.

That whole day, before I left and when we returned,  I thought somehow my husband knew, or would figure it out, but here we are about a week later and he's got no idea.

And guess what? They're perfectly fine now, no complications! (As I expected, DUH)

I don't want a prize or a cookie from y'all or anything, after all I remember to feed them and bathe them so vaccines are just another important and required step of parenting.  

I do want to say thank you so much to those that encouraged me to do this even though my husband was not in agreement.  I don't want my marriage to have any lies, but for THIS, it was the right thing to do.

Lastly, and most importantly:

For any parent out there in the same situation with your partner/spouse (many, many of you DM'd me) YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Take care of your kids and get them vaccinated, even if you have to go around your spouse like I did. It's worth it.



Tl;dr:  I vaccinated them last week. Husband has no idea. Walk in vaccines are available at the county health office, no appointment needed. Ice cream followed afterwards. Thanks for encouraging me, Reddit

My (23f) boyfriend (28m) says my vagina is too big,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months and he told me yesterday that my vagina is too big ""for my size"". I'm somewhat on the smaller side (5'3"" 135 lb) and he said I must be lying about how many guys I've been with. When we first started seeing each other we spoke about our past and I told him I've been with two guys before, both longterm boyfriends (which is the truth). We haven't talked about that since until yesterday with him saying that my vagina couldn't have been stretched out that much from just two guys and I had to be lying. I asked him why he is bringing this up now if it is such a problem and he said he always thought it was big and just didn't want to bring it up until now. I told him that really hurt my feelings and that was a horrible thing to say and he just said he just wants to hear the truth about who I've been with in the past. I told him he is an asshole and left and haven't spoken to him since yesterday.

I just want to point out as well that neither of the guys I was with in the past ever seemed to have a problem with the size of my vagina and neither of them were that big either (but both were bigger than my current bf). I don't have a problem with my boyfriend's size and enjoy sex when we have it, but he said he has a hard time finishing inside me because ""he can't feel anything"". When we first started going out it didn't seem to be a problem, but recently I have been needing to finish him with my hands or mouth for him to go.

I don't know, this just really hurts. He not only insulted me by saying I have a loose vagina and he doesn't enjoy having sex with me but also basically said I'm a slut and I'm lying to him. There isn't like there is anything I can do about it if I am too big (I looked). He is a great guy otherwise and I really love being with him and it is just really hurting me thinking he is going to end our relationship over this and that he is capable of saying those things to me.

Well, it's been half a year or so since the original posts and I wish I could tell you guys that everything worked out well. It has not. Unfortunately, my ex-GF went full high school, psycho immature after the break up and my fears have been realized.

After we broke up, she texted a bunch of friends and family members, telling them I broke up with her because I have a small penis and that I am insecure. For those of you that read the original posts, you know that is not the issue. She would also leave me drunken, slurred messages telling me not to be ashamed of my size. These messages were clearly meant to mock me. I hit the bottle hard for a while after the breakup and was missing work and social functions. I've pulled myself together over the last 2 or 3 months and even started seeing a girl. Unfortunately, this issue won't go away.

Two weeks ago, I brought this new girl to a local bar I used to frequent. Sure enough, I ran into my ex-GF and her new, muscle-bound, Affliction wearing douche bro boyfriend. Myself and the new girl were set up in the booth towards the back of the bar, and I had to walk past the table with my ex and her new BF. I didn't know how to react and decided ignoring her was best, as the relationship certainly did not end on good terms. It became apparent that they were already drunk and were now aware of my presence. I'll skip the complete rundown, but they started a verbal escalation that came very close to being physical. The bartender called the police who came, but as there were no fists thrown or damage, they basically just told all of us to go our separate ways.

I then got to have an awkward conversation with the new girl and explain all of the background info. She has been nothing but kind and understanding. Here's where the new problem starts:

Last week was finally time to seal the deal with her. We have been out on several dates. She told me she wanted to take things slow, didn't want to hook up right away, that she was looking for a BF, not a fling, etc. All of that is great as I really want to be in a relationship with a kind, loving person. When it came time for sex, I couldn't get it up. I cannot get my ex-GF's insults and actions out of my mind. Last night, same ED problem. The new girl has been very cool about this, but it has completely destroyed me. Again.

&#x200B;

How do I go forward? Should I just ghost everyone? Move to a new city, get a new job, literally cut people out of my life? How can a past relationship ruin this one? I'm at a loss. I have no idea how to proceed.",relationship_advice
"Trying my luck on this sub. ""My [37M] Son [21M] Slept With My Girlfriend [32], I Don't Know How To Process This Level Of Betrayal""","**Deleted off the other relationship sub, advised to repost here**

I apologize in advance if this isn't the most coherent thing in the world, this is partially just me venting to the void. About 4 years ago I lost my wife, the mother of my son, to lung cancer. We had been together since we were 14. It was the darkest time in my life, I had considered suicide on a nearly daily basis. I pushed on for my son, and because my wife made me promise to make the most of life.

We had our son pretty young, I worked two jobs to keep us afloat and thankfully was able to provide a decent upbringing until he moved out at 16, although I still paid (and continued to do so until this happened) a portion of his bills. The loss was extremely hard on my son as well, he came back to stay with me for awhile and we'd work through the grief together every day. I got him into therapy, pushed him to get involved in things to keep his mind busy and when he moved back into his apartment I'd call every night to check on him and visited multiple times a week. We were always extremely close.

My wife told me outright after her diagnosis that she didn't want me alone, so I made myself available. My girlfriend and I met about two years ago and hit it off. She isn't my wife, but I loved her for who she was and we really connected. I was reluctant to introduce her to my son because I was afraid he'd feel I was betraying his mother so I held off for the first year, which I regretted as they ended up getting along very well. We'd hang out together, my son was happy, I was happy. She moved in with me about 5 months ago.

This past Thursday he was over for dinner and movies. We've had this little game since he was a teenager where I'd pop up over his shoulder when he was on his phone in common areas and say ""stop looking at that!"" in an accusing way to mess with him even though he was never looking at anything. Turns out this time he was doing something and I seen topless photos on his phone. I recognized the photos to be of my girlfriend, same tattoo placement between the breasts. I grabbed the phone from him and he immediately starts pleading his case. I go into gallery and there are easily two dozen photos of my girlfriend, some of him I'm assuming he sent to her, one or two of them together. By this time he's crying and trying to grab the phone back, I check his texts and he has two weeks worth of conversations with her (under a different name) detailing the fact they've been fucking around behind my back. My girlfriend is in the room begging to know what's going on.

I'm not proud of the fact I lost myself. I screamed at them both, I smashed the phone (yes, I know this is unacceptable, yes I'm in therapy, yes it's the first time I got aggressive with either of them), I demanded details. My son kept apologizing and saying he didn't know why and that it had only started two weeks ago, they slept together 3 times. My girlfriend was sobbing and kept trying to hug me, telling me it was ""a mistake"", purely physical and that she'd never speak to him again. I screamed at my son that I'd given my life to him, that he knew what this meant to me, that he was all I had left. I pulled him upstairs and gave him the money for his phone and kicked him out. I went upstairs to our bedroom, turned her drawers upside down and packed her clothes into two travel bags while she kept asking me to listen. I put them outside, guided her through the door and told her she could have someone else get the rest of her belongings this week.

Both of them have been texting me nonstop until last night, at which point I blocked their number. I feel completely detached. The fact that after 2 years my girlfriend, knowing my history, could betray me is painful enough, and absolutely nothing will make me forgive her. She refuses to get her stuff until I talk to her so I'm having a friend drop it off to her. The fact my son, who I dropped everything for, worked non-stop to provide for, who was all I had left in this world could do this to me knowing what it would do is another pain entirely. It feels like I lost another family member. I ache for my wife all over again. I know everyone processes grief differently but this was two years after her passing, he had a girlfriend and I was there for him (as were therapists) every step of the way, so I have a hard time believing grief is the cause of his decision. I can't see this as a mistake, he didn't trip and fall. It was a conscious choice to betray someone who loved him.

I want to honor my wife by giving my son a chance, to hold on to the little family I have left. But this isn't like he stole money from me, it isn't even something that happened once while drunk. He was there for that grief with me, he knew how hard it was for me to move on. Of all the women, he chose mine. All the apologies or future effort can'r erase that fact or the memory of it. I never did wrong by him, and now I feel like the kid I raised isn't there anymore. Thanks to friends I'm not drifting into thoughts of self harm again, but I don't know if I have it in me to ever forgive him. If and when that day comes, what steps can I take to process what happened, talk to him without feeling disgust and open the door to trusting him again? And if that day never comes, does that make me a bad person?

**Edit** Some brief clarification since people on the other relationship sub took this and ran with it. 1.) Nothing caused him to move out, he asked and said it'd be cool and I helped pay his bills. No hidden resentment I've ever been aware of. 2.) Yes, popping up over his shoulder sometimes was something we both found funny. No I wasn't actually trying to invade his privacy, yes he was a part of the joke. 3.) Yes I know I was aggressive. I paid for the phone and will be discussing it in therapy. 4.) Yes I know this sounds like something out of a movie, it's not.

**TL;DR**: Lost my wife four years ago, just me and my son ever since. Found out he's sleeping with my girlfriend, feel completely empty inside. Need some sort of comfort or advice on how or if this can ever be fixed between him and I, and if that doesn't happen will I ever feel whole on my own again.",relationship_advice
Dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. Am I wrong to be angry?,"My dad left us and started a new family when I was 14. This had a profound impact on myself and my family. Life as a child of a single parent was hard as you can imagine. The government benefits was hardly enough to support 3 kids. We lived below the poverty line. My mom became an alcoholic. I started working as soon as I legally could to help with the finances. I sacrificed my childhood so that there was electricity and gas in the house. I started failing at school and payed out of my own pocket to hire a tutor. I went to university locally even though I had better offers elsewhere. I have a good and stable career now. My family lives with me but I feel they are not respecting me.


Recently my dad got in touch with my younger sister through Facebook. She met up with him and brought him back to my home. He didn't apologize for the pain he put me through. He made it all about himself and tried to gain sympathy with his plight. Am I the asshole for not caring and not wanting him in my life. I told him to leave. My mother and sister tried to defend him.  We got into an argument and I threatened to evict my own family.

I(20F) opened up my boyfriends(22M) Pandora's box and I heavily regret it,"Hello reddit, it's currently 4am and I can't find the will to sleep so excuse any typos and the format. 

I did something horrible and scummy, something that shows I'm insecure and have zero trust, nothing will excuse my actions but they weren't without reason. My boyfriend of almost a year, our anniversary is in less than two weeks, has been growing more and more distant. He hardly looks up while talking to me when we're at home and just stares at his phone half the time, he has told me he's cheated on every girl he's dated in the past and stayed pretty honest about that part of his life. 

Despite his growing distant nature we have plenty of happy moments and haven't had any major arguments recently. Though I've had a growing horrible gut feeling about a girl he has on Snapchat. We are hardly intimate anymore and any attempt is typically ended by him halfway. After a couple of drinks and a growing insecurity of why I might not be good enough I snooped through his phone to check out his conversations between mentioned girl. 

It didn't take much effort, he's told me his passcode to get into his phone numerous times and I figured a quick peak couldn't do much harm. I know I should have talked to him like an actual adult and voiced my concerns but recently he's been lying a lot and lying super easily. Typically about minor things like whether or not he's done any chores I've asked him to do around the house but it's scared me how easily he can lie to my face. Either that or he would get extremely defensive or upset over the fact that I'm upset.

To wrap up this post though, what I found was horrible, heart shattering and has left me sick to my stomach. His conversations with her are filled with her telling him how much she loves him, how much she wants to be with him and extremely sexual conversations. He's returned all these feelings and seems just as crazy about her as she is for him. At one point in their earlier conversations he mentions how he's only with me because it covers half the rent. I woke him up with my crying but couldn't explain to him what was wrong. Frankly I have no idea what to do or how to even go about talking to him about this. He hasn't physically cheated on me(at least to my knowledge) but they have talked about visiting one another or her moving in with him(if it wasn't for me of course). 

I'm sorry for the long rambling post but honestly what are my next steps how do I function after this and how would I even go about talking to him about this or if I'm better off dropping it and ignoring it forever. 

Edit/update: wow, thank you all so so so much you have been kind and wonderful and even the critical comments are eye opening and appreciated. I know I shouldn't have thought I was special and I know I should have paid attention but when you love someone you don't want to see the bad and I would typically be called untrusting or over paranoid. I have a lot of anxiety/depression so he would typically use this as a way to try and dodge any suspicion or conversations about him talking to other girls. This morning I attempted to act normal and keep a brave face until I could talk to family/friends but I ended up getting sick to my stomach and breaking down. I told him what I saw, I really just wanted an explanation or maybe I just wanted to know why the fuck I wasn't enough despite constantly throwing money at him when he needed it and picking up slack with things fell short. I didn't get much out of that. He couldn't offer any words of comfort that didn't sound selfish or like utter bullshit. He's at work now so off I go to plan for my future. One that involves me being happy and safe because this situation will only offer heartbreak and more depression. Again thank you so much, I'm crying but currently they're tears of happiness from all the support. ",relationship_advice
I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant.,"I'm a mess and on mobile so I'm sorry if this makes no sense. My boyfriend of almost 2 years has essentially been living a double life. I'm baffled as to how he pulled this off. When we met, he told me he was on the tail end of a nasty lengthy divorce, but that he had moved on and it would never pose an issue, and until now he was right, it never has. Last week I took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning I had a OBGYN visit to confirm. I was honestly ecstatic, I've always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven't been together for the longest time. I was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. His face went pale and he looked confused, not what I expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn't know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. Not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he's been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. I have no idea how I never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. That being said, it's not like he hardly spent any time with me. I'm heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. I'm still pregnant, with his third child, and he's still very much married. He left right after that conversation, and I've called and texted but the only response I've gotten is that he'll speak to me tomorrow night after work. His demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that I'm terrified he's going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. Another part of me doesn't want him anymore. If he's this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? What else COULD he lie about? I also would hate to break up a family like this. I feel disgusted in this whole situation, I've never felt more alone and confused. Should I be preemptive and leave him or are there other ways I could go about this?

Update: I think it's clear that I need to leave him, but that's about all that's clear for me right now. I want to be a mom, but these are the worst circumstances for that that I can imagine. I'm trying to think of ways to contact his wife and can't think of any. I do believe I was at the house where they once lived at one point, but he has moved since then (allegedly) so I have no idea what the new address is. I can't seem to piece this together at all. I don't understand how I was fooled for so long, I think I'm still in shock. To recap, I am leaving, I'm not sure if I want to abort, and as much as I want to tell his wife I have no way of doing that. I guess I'll wait until he speaks with me tomorrow. Thank you guys, if you'd like updates I'll keep posting.

UPDATE 2: I found his wife through a website someone sent me. He wasn't lying when he said he had no social media, but she does. Seeing the pictures of them made me realize I cannot keep our child, his family is beautiful and it breaks my heart to know he could do this to them, I cannot have the father of my child be someone like him. I still have no idea how to tell his wife.",relationship_advice

He said I'm too slow and I should go really fast and I should also put on a show for him because it's more fun that way.

I just told him I didn't wanna do anything anymore. I'll be honest, I cried in the bathroom for an hour. It was actually so embarrassing being told that...

Then, he sent me some videos saying ""this is what I meant. see how they're flipping their hair and look good.""

He's such an ass and he thinks he's being nice by educating me on what he likes so I can be better next time. And those videos involved some serious core strength that I don't have

I don't even know where to start. Part of the reason I didn't update right away was because my thoughts have been all over the place as of late. I have been making major adjustments and dealing with a lot. 

My daughter is not actually mine. While it was incredibly hard to get through at first, I think that a small part of me was already mentally prepared for it. I just had a feeling. I hoped it wasn't true and I convinced myself that I was doing this just to rid my anxiety but I think deep down I knew. 

I took a lot of the advice given and I thought about it for a few days. After deciding how I was going to approach the conversation I asked my fiancé to drop the baby off at her Mother's house so we could have a night to ourselves. I made dinner and then tried to talk about things that we had been going through recently and how our lives had changed since having the baby. I explained that I had been having bad anxiety and that I believed that it was partially caused by becoming a new parent but also the fact that I was sterile one minute and then told we were having a baby the next. Right away she saw where I was going with that and she did get a bit defensive. She continued to tell me that ""miracles happen"" and that she couldn't believe I didn't trust her. I explained that I saw exactly where she was coming from but asked that she saw it from point of view as well. We argued and she refused to do the test. I told her it was fine and that I would leave it alone. 

I wanted to leave it alone but she kept bringing it up all night even after I had apologized and said that I wouldn't bring it up again. She kept telling me that she couldn't believe I would think of her that way and that I should just ""be happy that we have a beautiful healthy daughter instead of trying to accuse her of cheating"". That's when I started to question her. Something just didn't feel right and I knew I had to do the test regardless. I did the test the next day and waited a few days. By the end of the week I found out that she wasn't mine.

I cried for about two days straight, I just couldn't handle it and I had no idea what I was going to do. I tried to spend as little time in the house as I could because I knew she would see something was wrong right away. I struggled with figuring out how I would let her know that I knew. I also contemplated wether or not I should say anything because I knew that this would change things with my daughter. I  finally decided to just tell her. Of course she denied it and said that the test was wrong and that I need to just drop it. I explained that the clinic said there was no way this could be an error. She continued to deny it and I just couldn't believe that she would still lie to me straight to my face. 

She threatened to leave and take the baby even though she has no where to go seeing as her own mother doesn't want to get involved. We've been pretty much ignoring each other when we're not dealing with the baby. She said that she will be out in 2 months and I'm glad. My concern right now is wether or not she has the right to take the baby. I love my daughter more than anything but I refuse to stay with this woman. I know the baby is not my blood but if I'm on the birth certificate does that help. I at least want to have shared custody. I bring on over half of the income of provide everything for the baby. There is no way that she could take care of the baby without me. She will not be able to afford it. I know there's probably no way possible for me to get some custody but is it pointless to fight for shared? I can't lose my daughter. As much as I hate what my fiancé did, I don't even hate her. 

I can't explain how hard it is having to deal with losing someone I love so much but also knowing that they would do something so terrible. It's hard enough having to end this with her but I don't think I can handle not seeing my daughter anymore either. Please help with any advice as far as how I can fight for shared custody if that's even possible given the circumstances. 

Tldr: My daughter is not my blood. I don't know how to move forward. I don't want to lost my daughter regardless of the circumstances. 

Edit: For ever person that feels the need to comment rude things like ""she is NOT your daughter"" please stop wasting your time. I am aware that she is not my blood. That does not take away from the fact that I have been the one taking care of her since she was born. I have been the one changing her diapers, feeding her, etc. It baffles me that some of you don't have the decency to understand that after creating this bond with her, I refuse to say she's not my daughter now. I know that this is reddit and that I am probably asking a lot of some of you but seriously how hard is it to just be decent person? ",relationship_advice

Thanks for all your responses, they helped me so much.

Yesterday morning, I texted him with the reasons why I found his words to be so hurtful, thinking he'd my message and apologize. However, I should have known that he'd just ignore me.

He left me on read for the whole of yesterday and today. Finally, at night, he texts me to say that he's been really busy at work the past couple of days. Then he was like ""Can i be honest with you? I'm really not feeling this, so lets end it. Been on the fence about it for some time but after our fight I knew that this wasnt right."" 

Thats it. He already unfollowed me on Instagram and unfriended me on Facebook. I was venting to a friend (incidentally, his coworker) and she told me that he was kind of bummed out all day because he found out his ex got a new boyfriend. 


This honestly sucks. I actually felt like we had something. But I should have seen the red flags in hindsight, of which there were many. I get it though. Dude dated a beautiful fashion model for 5 years, how can he go back to being with a normal woman. But unless he knows any other models, I guess we mere mortals will have to do.

TL;DR: BF ignored my messages after the fight, then he texted to break up with me. ",relationship_advice

My mother was extremely emotionally manipulative and a narcissist herself... she would be overly controlling and critical, throwing in overt and covert put downs and cruel verbal abuse, in addition to attempting to control everything I did. ""You don't have it as bad as I did, you wimp."" ""You could be so much better than you are if you worked as hard as I do"" ""You're going to that crazy school where they teach you the wrong things. Come home and stop letting them poison you.""

From the book: ""For those who have been abused as children by narcissistic parents, trauma literally changes the structure of a child's developing brain which is extremely malleable during that time. Dr. Martin Teicher (2006) pointed out the growing evidence that verbal abuse in childhood can change the way a brain is wired... There has been corresponding research that confirms that parental verbal aggression can in fact lead to changes in the brain."" (pg 160)

Also from the book: ""For those of us who have experienced narcissitic abuse since childhood, many of us are familiar with the trauma bonds that can keep us locked in the vicious cycle of meeting and mating with narcissists."" (11)

That second quote is the first line of the introduction. I was hooked. 

There are biochemical bonds that are formed, especially in children, with victims to abusive people. 

""When trauma survivors encounter stimuli that remind them of their trauma... the amygdala (which processes emotions) reacts as if they are experiencing the same event."" (163)

In fact, the biochemical bond is so strong it can even affect memory in a phenomenon called ""abuse amnesia"". The reason that I can't always remember exactly what hurtful things my partner said to me is because my brain literally programmed it out. 

The chemicals my brain associated with my partner were: Oxytocin, Dopamine, Cortisol, Adrenaline Norepiephrine, and Serotonin. You may have heard of some of these: Oxy, the ""feel good"" drug, the drug labeled ""Dope"" - the drug that rewards us for certain behaviors, Cortisol, the stress hormone, adrenaline and norepinephrine as the ""fight or flight"" hormones, and serotonin is the mood regulator. With an abusive partner, these rise and fall at any given moment. This leads to what is called a ""Trauma Bond"" - the result of intense emotional experiences that happen with our abusers. (162-175)

Abused people are basically kept strung out on certain types of drugs and hormones for their entire relationship. My abuser has never ever had to show her true self because with narcissists, there is no true self. They rely on masks and fake emotions to get their way in any situation. 

""What abuse, Throwaway? It can't really be that bad."" 

There is a cycle of narcissistic abuse, and it all starts with Trauma Bonding. The cycle is Idealize, Devalue, Discard, Destroy, Hoover. The Trauma bonds are located in the entire cycle, see if you can spot them. 

Idealize means your partner fawns over you, often called ""love-bombing"". It's a honeymoon period with occasional insights into their narcissistic nature that good people often chalk up to human error. See, the narcissist only looks for targets who are prime candidates for emotional manipulation. My wife and I dated for three months before we decided to get married. She also made us having sex extremely frequent and completely mind-blowing, as that was something I hadn't experienced before and (we'll get to this later) she had a LOT of practice. This idealization also causes most normal people to open up and be vulnerable with their partner, but this is just fuel for the narcissist's next phase:

Devalue means that they will begin to pick on your insecurities, hopes and dreams, and character. Once you're ""hooked"" on the Dopamine and the Oxytocin, everything is exploitable. The narcissist will employ covert and overt strategies of putting you down and making you feel worthless. I experience this with harsh ""jokes"" - ""My husband is such an idiot he forgot to unplug the coffee machine. He probably needed more coffee!"" Oh, yeah, this happens in public too. I also got overt put-downs. ""You wouldn't have lost the tickets if you weren't so stupid. You can't focus on anything, you need to get your shit together."" ""Why don't you ever think about me? You're so selfish."" She also attacks my support networks, calling my friend my ""butt-buddy"", and bombing my phone with text messages whenever I'm at his house (once a week to gather with friends and hang out). -Even typing that made my cortisol rise, thinking about how my self-care could be interpreted as selfishness when it is NOT. Your value plummets, setting you up for the next phase: 

Discard is when the partner throws you to the curb, literally or figuratively. There is a moment when the narcissist gets tired of the ""supply"" (The attention an admiration of their ""trophies""... we say trophies because the narcissist only views people as objects that are extensions of themselves, like a purse or umbrella), and when the narcissist is tired of the supply, it will move on to a new one. In my relationship this looks like ""I'm done with you."" followed by excessive doting on our kids (her new supply). However, she gets worn out with them even faster, because while I can hide my emotions, the kids cannot. The other day one of the boys accidentally kneed the older one in the nose, and he started crying. She told him he has an ugly cry, and then he cried harder because he was called ugly and then my wife said ""What? I didn't say you were ugly, I said you had an ugly cry"". I cradled him in my arms and told him mommy didn't mean it. She dismissed us all and went to go chat with her boy toy in her bed. Her favorite words, each and every day, are ""I'm done!"" Then she emotionally abandons us, sometimes for days on end. This is another element of trauma, and this is what I'm worried about for our kids. What happens when this is the norm when I'm not there, and I can't help organize the pieces when trauma happens... I say pieces because trauma is literally a fracturing of the brain. Oh yeah, did I mention that I've been relegated to sleep in the guest bedroom... because I went and helped a friend with a woodworking project after the kids were asleep?

Then, destroy. The narcissist will use their posse to destroy the character of the abused person, making it seem like they are the crazy person. Fortunately, in my situation, I have the support network where she does not yet. It takes time for her to establish, and she hasn't had enough of that yet. So, it's only 2-3 people right now. 

Then, the most significant piece for me, ""hoovering"". ""This is when the narcissist, like a hoover vacuum, attempts to suck you back in to the traumatic vortex of the relationship. Usually this occurs when the narcissist loses control of the victim and wants to regain control at the very moment the victim attempts to move forward with his or her life."" (51) I'll update the post with the way she tries to hoover back in after she's served. In the past, it's been with sex. After the conference, she had sex with me every night for a week. Probably because she'd already hooked up with her current fling. I had no idea. 

Now, what specific elements of abuse are we looking at?

Buckle up folks because it's about to get very real for some of you. If your partner exhibits one or two of these, it may be NPD, or it may be something else. But if they exhibit 7, 8, or 9... Then DM me and we can talk about how the book says you can get out of that abusive relationship.  

Toxic and abusive behaviors exhibited by someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 

1. Being overly critical and controlling towards their partners, covertly and overtly putting them down through cruel verbal abuse - name calling, harsh insults disguised as jokes, contemptuous remarks about victim's appearance, lifestyle, line of work, or support networks. 

2. Being physically and/or sexually abusive - coercing into sexual situations you aren't comfortable with, or even threatening to leave or ruin the victim's life if they do not comply with their wishes. 

3. Engaging in Hot/Cold behavior (alternating through different hormones and drugs). This is the cycle of idealize, devalue, discard. They love you completely or they hate you. 

4. Controlling every aspect of the partner's life - isolate the partner from family and friends and sabotage important life events or goals and aspirations. 

5. Stonewalling into silence: any concerns about the relationship are met with silent treatment, ""I'm done"", or disappearance. 

6. Triangulating Victims with other love interests, comparing the victim to previous lovers and relationships. 

7. Gaslighting - diminishing the abuse so that it doesn't feel real, deflecting accountability. 

8. Smear Campaings - Slander the victim's character and reputation so that the abuse victim is left with no support network. They project their own bad behavior onto the victim. 

9. Blameshifting - projection of malignant traits onto the victim so that they seem like the crazy person, and the aggressor appears just fine. 

That's all her to a T.

So, there you go. That's why I think she's an unfit mother and that's why it was so hard to realize I needed to leave. I had set a boundary (don't fuck other guys) and when she broke it, I realized all the other stuff that was off. Narcissists don't have boundaries, and kids need boundaries, among all the other crazy emotional abuse they'll be subjected to with her. 


UPDATE: This week has been exhausting. I went to visit three lawyers and contracted with one. The papers are being worked on. It will take at least 24 hours to process, then they'll talk with me about a plan to serve her. 

You might be wondering how I secured a lawyer. Well, I had not really had ties with my family. My dad and her are always at odds, and after one time that he didn't follow one of her rules with one of the boys, she lost it at him. She convinced me he was the toxic one and that he was bad for our relationship. So I hadn't REALLY talked with him in like a year, even though I had convinced her to let him come visit once, she didn't say a word to him the whole time. 

I didn't know where else to go so I called him up. He picked up immediately, excited to hear from me, and this was our conversation: 

""Dad, are you alone? And you promise not to freak out?"" 

""Yes. What's the matter son?"" 

""...my wife is having an affair."" 

""Oh Throwaway... I'm so sorry."" 

My parents had gotten a divorce when I was 18. He really was sorry. I continued:

""Dad I'm sorry."" 

""Son you didn't do anything wrong."" 

At this point, I can't hold it all together anymore. I lose it, completely, in car, at the parking lot of the grocery store. I haven't sobbed like that since I was a child. I'm crying right now as I type this. 

""...Yes I did, I'm so sorry. I've been awful to you.""

At this point, he starts crying too. And I sob more. 

""I'm just sorry you're in pain, Throwaway. I'll tell you this so you don't feel like you have to keep saying you're sorry... I forgive you, but you haven't done anything to wrong me."" 

That's what love looks like. I'd been missing that feeling this whole time. This understanding that love makes sacrifices; doesn't focus on itself. And my dad has always loved me.  

Then he told me he'd pay for whatever I needed, no matter how he had to do it. 


When this is all over, I'll have a proper update probably in a new post. I'm so tired of pretending, but I need to hold out for another week. My little ones, my conversations with my dad, my close friends and the support from y'all keep me going. I hope to have another update by next Friday. Wish me luck. 

Also how long has there been a typo in the title?? Sheesh. 



TL;DR: stuck in a relationship with a cheater. 

Throwaway for obvious reasons and details changed, Yadda yadda. 

It all started a few months ago. 

There was a continuing education experience that I was looking into attending for my job. However, when I brought it up, my wife expressed interest in also going because it was not only something she was interested in, but she hadn't been able to go in years because of our kids [2 boys, under 5 years]. I know moms work really hard to care for their kiddos especially in those younger years. I work full-time so the moment I get home I take the kid's so she can get some rest. 

Anyway this request seemed difficult but I decided I'd put my neck out for her. After all, she deserves to grow too, right? So I spend my proverbial chips asking my boss if she can go instead of me. Surprisingly, he's actually ok with it after our frank and candid discussion, so she's able to go. I spend the week mostly home from work except when kids are at preschool, take care of the house and kids, and it's an awesome week. The boys and I get really close, playing all kinds of games and solidifying the bedtime routine... 

Saturday rolls around when my wife is getting back, and she's over the moon. It seemed like the conference was really good for her. She came back with a lot of stories, as she loves to tell stories about her events. She informs me she's so happy she has friends she can talk to now and mentions that she'd like to go hang out with them now that she knows them. We live in a suburb, and they can all go hang out in the city together. I'm very excited for her as I haven't seen her this happy in a while. She typically experiences bouts of depression so this was amazing. 

Fast forward a bit. She is getting ready to go hang out with them and she comes out from getting ready and she looks **cuuuuuute**. Little tank top, shorts that make her booty pop. I comment and just says thanks. She'll be back in a while. 

She gets back and I ask how it went. ""Good."" 

""...who did you hang out with?"" "" I don't know, people? You don't know them."" 

I brushed it off, but notes that she didn't tell me any stories. She always does that. 

She does this three more times. I start getting suspicious. She's getting distant and she's always on her phone. I start to put two and two together. 

Well, I see she's on google hangout a lot. We know each other's passwords for accountability, and hers is already up on my phone whenever I log in (but I don't often log in). I start to think maybe she's cheating. Then I have to convince myself she's not. She wouldn't do that. We've been married 9 years, we have two kids. She's over in the city right now with her friends, it's just a chill time to be herself. Right? 

I tried so hard but I couldn't stop. I logged into google hangouts and there it was. One of the guys she met at the conference and her was at the top of the message list. All their correspondence was right there. 

It was vile.

Things my wife and I had never said to each other. They were rendezvousing, just the two of them, to fuck. They were meeting up right now, at the ""usual place"". 

And when they weren't fucking, they were sexting like crazy. My kids were in the room while she was sending those messages. I almost threw up. My heart rate was at 175 at least. I felt every possible emotion a person could feel while sill having to care for the boys: make dinner, do baths, get ready for bed. I told them I was feeling sad, but not because of them, and that daddy might need a little more patience. They were amazing. 

That was 6 days ago. 

I've had to pretend, for 6 days, that nothing is wrong. 

I contacted a lawyer and I am filing for divorce. However, the retainer fee is way, WAY more than I or anyone in my family has. 

So I have to pretend everything is ok while I find this money. 

A couple nights ago she asked if I wanted to have sex and I said I had a headache. Then I *actually* was sick to my stomach and almost vomited again. I can't have sex with her as the guy may not be clean and I don't want a VD. Plus... it hurts to think about how she could do that. What did I do wrong?

I have no idea what to do. She's keeping up the charade just fine, but I'm cracking as time goes on. What should I do? I have to protect my boys from her... she's not stable. Pathological liar, inappropriate conduct, and the kicker? 

We're in the middle of marriage therapy. 

What should I do?

Edit: People are asking why I am concerned about my kids. Good question.

When I was 22 I met her at a convention... much like this one. Huh. It turned out she only lived like half an hour from me, so we started hanging out. Found out that until recently, she had a fiancee. No big deal... that's totally normal for a 20 year old to have gotten engaged and ended it, right? She said he cheated on her. [Press X to doubt]

She showed up after we'd been dating for a bit with a suicide note in her hand.

I took her inside and from that night onward, I didn't leave her side. I wanted to make sure she was safe. She would lock herself in the bathroom with razor blades and cut herself.

Since the beginning of our relationship, and after we got married, she'd said she felt depression and thoughts of suicide at least five or six times.

She also has absolutely no impulse control (obviously), she is a narcissist (everything is someone else's fault, never her own), and she doesn't have any emotionally healthy behaviors with the children (yells instead of communicates, tells them ""I'm done"" instead of parenting and just leaves it to me).

My kids won't got to bed unless I put them down. I wake up with them every morning, and when they wake up in the middle of the night. I make and feed them breakfast, she sometimes makes them dinner (like she did last night) but usually she asks for fast food. Which is unfortunate because she does cook really well.

All that and she lies about everything.

She's unstable and inconsistent, and kids need emotional stability and consistency.",relationship_advice
"My [23M] gf [25F] has a disgusting fetish, and I don't know if I can handle it.","So, I met this beautiful woman about 7 months ago at an alumni function. We hit it off and honestly she's everything I could ask for. I'm not sure if I'm still in the honeymoon phase, but so far everything is working out and she even moved in with me two months ago with no problems.

However, this past holiday season she started doing something gross. Honestly, it's so disgusting I haven't even asked my friends or family for help on this matter. On Christmas Eve, I woke up pleasantly surprised to see that she was cooking breakfast. But, when I looked at my scrambled eggs, it looked really really sketchy. It looked way too moist. My gf told me she used a fancy cheese which is why it was extra moist and smelly. I believed her and ate it. The texture was absolutely horrendous, but taste-wise it was fine. She beamed and started planning our holiday. 

Then on New Year's Eve, we were cuddling and doing couple things. She brought strawberries and whipped cream. We did some fun with the whipped cream and she fed me the strawberries. Then she chewed up a berry and fed it to me. I thought it was weird, but I was so horny I didn't mind. We finished the rest of the berries in the same manner, and the subsequent sex was AMAZING. 

But... now she's starting to chew her food and feed it to me. Sometimes not in a sexual manner. Steak, chicken, salad, eggs, etc. It's so disgusting. When I tell her to stop she starts crying and says I don't love her enough. All of our fights were about this issue. I eventually eat some and its so gross. I recoil whenever I think about the texture. 

Help??? I thought maybe she needs to talk to a therapist or maybe I should contact an ex of hers to see if he went through something similar. She is perfect for me except for this one issue. 


--**Update**-- 
So in the comments below, apparently her saliva started fermenting/digesting the eggs for me. This is probably why it had a sour smell. Also, she's very attractive and needs constant validation. She makes me eat her regurgitated food as ""proof"" that I love her. Besides this, she's honestly my ideal partner. I don't want to throw this away. I will be meeting with an ex of hers tomorrow. Will keep you guys posted. ",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [25M] wife [25F] has 1000 matches on tinder. We are high school sweethearts.,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/byt7xr/my_25m_wife_25f_has_1000_matches_on_tinder_we_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I finally worked up the balls to confront my wife over this three days ago, on Sunday. We went out to brunch, and after, I told her straight up that I saw a tinder notification.

She told me that she uses it as a confidence boaster, something not so surprising. She then opened her profile and showed that she hadn't talked to any of the guys she matched with; I scrolled around for a bit, something she let me do, and found that she was telling the truth. There were only incoming messages, no outgoing. 

I told her that that made me very uncomfortable, and that I still loved her very much and that she shouldn't be unconfident. She said that she was insecure about her pregnancy body, she didn't think I was attracted to her anymore, she had nagging thoughts that I was having an affair (not true at all), and that she would never see another man. 

I asked her to delete it, and she did instantly. She told me that, if I was still paranoid, I had every right to snoop on her phone from time to time without permission. I told her I had no intention of doing that (I dont) because I don't want to be ""that husband.""

We're off to couples therapy, but I think we'll be alright. I just hope she gets her confidence back soon; she has no reason to be insecure.

TL;DR Wife insecure as I expected, used tinder as a confidence booster. Proved it, now off to couples therapy.",relationship_advice
I(21M) got caught lying about my age by my girlfriend(25F). Her anger has mostly subsided. But her friend who outed me has been egging her on to dump me. What should I do?,"Last year I got dragged into a meetup for Asian foreign students by my Indian roommate. Btw I am a 2nd gen Japanese-American. We were late and had already missed the introduction stage. The room had already divided into groups and from the corner of my eye I saw this really tall and beautiful Asian girl standing alone holding a big dictionary in her hands. It took me some time to approach her but I finally did. I said hi and she introduced herself in broken English. She was from Korea, a few years elder to me and was doing her grad studies in a university near mine. I introduced myself too and only mentioned my university name which is an ivy league university. She was really impressed as my uni is pretty famous back in her home country. I took her number and we started texting.

We mostly texted about her classes (she is a business grad) and I was pretty good in those subjects too. As days went on our conversations got deeper. After a few weeks I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said yes. I started calling her 'boo' and she started calling me 'oppa'. I thought it meant the same as honey or babe or something in korean.

It was only after a few more months that I came to know that something was wrong. My roommate overheard her calling me oppa on the phone. He asked me that whether my gf was okay with dating someone younger to her. I asked him why would she worry. And then came the bombshell. It turns out that oppa means big brother in korean. It is usually used by girls to address guys who are older. But its also used as a synonym for honey or babe for boyfriends who are elder to their girlfriends. It cant be used for guys who are younger than their girlfriends. Also, it turns out that age is a pretty big issue in korea.(My roommate watches a lot of korean dramas.)

So the next day i asked my girlfriend about it and all of it turned out to be true. That day she was introducing me to her other korean classmates too. When they asked me about my age, before I could even answer she told them I was 26. Later on I asked her how she knew my age as I had never told her directly. She told me she got it from facebook and was happy that I was older as she would have probably not dated me if I was younger. (I had created my facebook account when I was 10 and put a fake bday ) And at that moment I knew I was in trouble.

I was trying to figure out how to tell her the truth without making her so angry that she would dump me. Before I could do that I was outed by one of her friends. My gf stopped taking my calls and ignored me for 3 days before she agreed to meet me. She asked me if I was trying to play with her feelings and was it all a joke. She was very angry and I had to do a lot to convince her that I really love her. I was so scared that she would dump me that I started crying. I guess that melted her heart a little bit. She told me to let her calm down for 2 days. After those two days she accepted me again.

She has decided that she is not gonna let my age matter to her. But her korean friends have already termed me as an american playboy who is going to cheat on her any day.  I am scared that one day she would get brainwashed by them and dump me for good. What should I do?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: I took her out for dinner yesterday. Her friends joined us afterwards. We talked it all out. Luckily my gf was on my side. I guess her friends took the story in a sporting manner too. Though i did feel some glares from one of them. 

Before that my gf and I had a long talk. From what I understood she was just scared that I was just playing a game with her or something like she had seen in many American shows. She comes from a small town in Korea where people have many weird stereotypes about Americans in general. Anyways we sorted it all out. I told her about my fears too. To that she said if we were to ever break up it would be because of something between us and not because of someone from outside.

Btw my roommate suggested me to call her 'noona', so I did but she straight up got angry at that stuff.  It seems I have a lot to learn. I can also see that sometimes she gets conflicted in the way she addresses me but I find it cute.

Thanks for all the advice. I was in a very bad mental state when I wrote this post. She is like my first girlfriend whom I would really wanna marry. To lose her would really break me apart. I know I am a man and stuff but this is one of the places I can really let it all out.",relationship_advice
I say my parents and boyfriend down to have a long and much needed talk.,"My last post talks about how my dad and mom bully my boyfriend. I've been keeping my boyfriend away because of it. 

Okay here's what happened. Mom made a huge dinner Wednesday night and said she wished she had more people to enjoy it. I took the opportunity to get this over with. I called up my boyfriend and told him to come over. Boyfriend showed up, we sat at the table to eat. Here's the conversation that followed. 

Dad: ""Well look who decided to finally show.""

Me: ""Dad, I'm tired of this.""

Dad: ""Tired of what, I'm just kidding, gosh!""

Boyfriend cut in and shut it all down. It was amazing. I thought I was going to do most of the talking but here boyfriend does this wonderful thing. My parents faces were a mix of shock and sadness. 

Boyfriend: ""No it's not joking. It's not just kidding around. It hurts when you single me out. It hurts when you both laugh at me. Why? What could I have possibly done to deserve this? I've treated you all, including your daughter, with respect and this is the thanks I get. I've been staying away because I always get talked down to. Yes I'm a landscaper, yes I have anxiety, yes I'm human and I don't need you both to act like I'm not.""


As requested an edit:

My dad excused himself from the dinner table. My mom kept picking at her food. Boyfriend and I ate with smiles on our faces. 

Boyfriend stayed over and Friday morning my parents apologized. He took boyfriend aside to talk to him. I heard from boyfriend that dad felt terrible for his actions and was unaware of the fact that he was hurting him. ",relationship_advice
"My grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (F24) to marry him (26). I don't know what to do, since I don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).","What do you do when you find out that someone you love more than anything in the world actually has some bad qualities? 

I was orphaned at 8, and my paternal grandparents took me in. They've raised me with the utmost love and care anyone could ask for, and I'm not lying when I say that they'd readily die for me - but most parents/grandparents are like that so you all know what I'm talking about. 

I've always looked up to them, and they've always set the very best examples for me; I've never ever seen either of them be unkind to a single soul, and they've always taught me to be that way too. 

Recently though, I received the shock of my life when I saw their reaction to seeing my boyfriend (let's call him Sam) for the first time (who happens to be black). I've never pegged them for racist people, and it was honestly unexpected. They tried to hide it but I could see it on their faces, that they didn't approve. 

Since then they've just never liked the guy, and have always been like really nit-picky about him, criticising him about the smallest of things, always judging every single thing he says and does very harshly etc. I've tried time and again to convince them that he's a really good guy, that he loves me and cares about me but to no avail. 

Well, he proposed to me, and it was the happiest moment of my life. When I told my grandparents though, it was clear they were upset. This time, unlike before, they didn't make excuses about why they didn't like him and just straight up confessed to having a problem with his race. 

At first I was incredibly pissed off, but I tried to reason with them and get to the bottom of why they felt this way. They think all black people are really similar to the way they're portrayed in racist stereotypes. This is all despite the fact that he's nothing like the racist stereotypes portray black people. He's a college educated, well dressed, well spoken man with a good job and a decent salary. This doesn't sway them. 

Another thing that really confuses me is my mom, who was Asian. They were apparently not only okay with their son marrying an Asian woman, they loved her like she was their own daughter. They're also really good friends with my maternal grandparents, who are from Korea/Singapore. When my maternal grandparents found out, they weren't too happy either, and they were actually much more direct about it compared to my paternal grandparents. 

I honestly don't know what to do. My~~boyfriend~~ fiancé has always sorta known that my grandparents didn't really like him, but he doesn't suspect that it's because of his race. 

My friends have all unanimously sided against my grandparents and said stuff like ""they don't get to dictate what you do with your life; tell them to either accept it or you'll cut them off permanently; just cut them off they're toxic people"" etc. 

While my grandparents are definitely in the wrong about all this, I can't even begin to fathom cutting them out of my life. They gave everything they had and more to raise me and give me the best life they could. They're the reason I am who I am today; they were always there for me, took care of my every need and always put me above themselves. How can I just abandon them like this? After everything they've done for me? 

On the other hand I can't imagine losing Sam either. 

What do I do?

P.S I gave my maternal grandparents an earful, and told them straight up that they had no right to say the kind of stuff they said about Sam, and that it was extremely rude.

**Update:** Just posted [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2l5lo/update_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/) My apologies for the concerns questioning the validity of my post. I used the same throwaway account in another sub to ask a question in which I scrambled identifying information. Thanks to the mods here for keeping shitposts out of the feed, and for taking the time to verify my identity. 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (24F) leave on a flight in 3 hours for a 5 day business trip. My husband (28M)  is currently sleeping, and I'm finishing packing. I text message popped up on his phone saying, ""Yeah, I'd love to spend the night! That'll make things so much easier."" It was from a friend (18F) of his who we've had disagreements over before (mostly because he doesn't feel the need to tell me anything about her, when they hang out, etc. Which he does on his own for all of his male friends). He has a number of female friends, and I really don't mind. They're good people, and there seem to be boundaries in place. Not with this girl though. Texts from her frequently pop up throughout the day, and as late as 1 and 2 in the morning.

I'll admit it, curiosity got the better of me, and I read their previous few messages. He invited her over to go on a day trip with him to his favorite place to smoke weed. It's her first time. He then invited her to stay the night before, so they could get an early start the next day.

Thing is, as we were going to bed last night, I asked him what his plans were while I was gone. He usually makes an effort to do something fun for himself, and to get one big honey-do item taken care of. When we were talking about my trip last night, he was VERY detailed in his plans (down to what he'll be doing each day, which was unusual) but he made no mention of this girl, and made it sound as though he was making the drive alone. When I suggested he hang out with one of his friends, he said ""I dunno. I think I could use a quiet weekend in.""

I'm freaking out a bit. We have been having some trouble, and I saw in their messages that he's been talking to her about it... A LOT. I get needing to have a friend to talk to, but he's always telling me he doesn't want his friends to think poorly of me. Yet from their messages, she obviously does.

Reddit, what do I do? How do I handle this?

Edit: I should mention that he's had a history of hiding behavior with women from me. Thing is, I'm really easy going and whenever he tells me ""so and so is coming over"" I'm the one who brings home snacks for them. Yet he's also lied about talking with a female coworker about sex (very late at night), and sharing a bed with someone he used to hook up with, to name a few. I feel so stupid.

Edit 2: Any advice for bringing this up? Part of me wants to confront him before I go. We had a really great (I thought) conversation last night where we decided to take this time apart to figure out what our marriage needs, and what each of us needs individually, so we can make things work. Apparently he needs her.

The other half of me wants to wait until I know she's there, and then ask him what's up. I'm not really sure what to do, I've never been in this position before.",relationship_advice
FINAL UPDATE I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant.,"Short update because I realize it kind of seems like I left you guys hanging. 

First I'd like to address that the pregnancy was not unexpected but not explicitly planned. ""Accidental"" was not the right word, but I'm aware of how babies are made. I was in a sense trying to get pregnant, but only because my ex lied to me and convinced me he was onboard. I'm not gonna sit here and explain the ins and outs of how I was duped, I was stupid and missed some flags but I absolutely planned on bringing a child into what I expected would be a healthy, safe, loving environment. 

That environment is not real. I am not ready to be a mother under the current circumstances, I am not mentally or emotionally fit to carry out a pregnancy, and I am most definitely not going to put a child through the adoption system. It is just not a guarantee of a good life and I can't in good conscience do that. For those and other reasons I've explained before, I have begun the process of getting an abortion. 

I collected photographs, videos, screenshots of texts, and everything I could find as evidence to show my ex's wife. I tried to find texts in which he referenced being divorced or just any lies to prove that I'm not at fault, but I heeded yalls warnings to not try and help her or push her too far since I don't know how she'd receive these news. I simply found her on social media, sent her all the pictures and screenshots, and a short run down of what her husbands been doing for 2 years. It took a day for her to respond but all she said was ""thank you"" and once I saw that, I blocked her. 

I have not heard from anyone and I hope to never have to hear or think about this situation again. It's behind me. I have no idea what happened with my ex and his wife, and I probably never will. 

Thank you guys for your support.",relationship_advice
"Me 23 M with ex 23 F, we were high school sweethearts. She left me to ""have fun"" in college. Now is out of school, back home and is pissed & has everyone else pissed at me because I wont take her back","Sorry that title was super wordy.  But it kind of explains most of the problem here.  We had been together since we were juniors in high school.  We were each others first everything and I thought that we were going to be together forever.  But she went away to college and midway through her freshman year she comes home and tells me before she leaves that while she loves me with all of her heart and I am the one she wants to be with forever and marry that while she is in college she does not want to be tied down and needed to be able to have her fun.  She was telling me this as though she were explaining the directions to hooking up a computer.  In other words no emotion, just simply statements of facts and my thoughts and feelings on the situation did not matter.  She even went on to tell me that she wanted to make sure I knew she would always practice ""safe sex"" for our future together.
  
Well my reaction I guess was not what she planned.  Needless to say I'm not very proud of how I reacted at the time but I became very emotional with her.  I begged her not to do this and that under no circumstance would I ever consider this okay.  She basically said I was being immature and that once a couple of weeks passed I would be able to talk to her rationally.  Oh and as a bonus she wanted to get my assurance that I would practice safe sex as well for when we got back together.

The two weeks went by and she called me and acted like no big deal.  But as we started to end the call she wanted to make sure that I was ""better"" about her sleeping with other guys.  I use the present tense because as she then informed me in that two weeks she had already slept with two other guys.  Again not proud of this now but I broke down when she told me this.  She said she did not want to hurt me so she wouldn't be telling me anymore about what she does.  I told her that I had no desire to talk with her anymore period.  That I was willing to work on things before she slept with other people but that was the end of it for me and I told her I was done.  She said once again that I was being immature and that she would just wait on me to contact her when I was grown up enough to understand that there is a difference between sex and love.  That was the last time I spoke to her until about 1 month ago when she moved back home and showed up at my house one night acting like we had been together and not apart for three years.  She did not expect nor appreciate my reaction to her showing up.

I opened the door and there she was with a big smile on her face.  She immediately asked to come in and I said I would come outside which obviously caught her off guard.  I asked what she wanted and she said and I quote ""well that's a hell of a way to greet someone you love"".  To which I told her that she was delusional and that whatever love I had for her died the day she told me she had already started having sex with other men.  She honestly had a very confused look on her face and then said and I quote again ""are you still uptight about all of that"" and then said ""I would have thought by now you would have grow up about that"".  

I told her that not only was I not over it, that I would never be over it other than to be over us.  At which time she proceeds to say to me ""you mean to tell me you are throwing away everything that we are together because of some stupid physical issue"".  ""I know we love each other and are meant to be together so how do we fix this"".  

I was just dumbstruck.  How in the fuck can one person be this stupid.  I asked her what I was throwing away.  We have not spoken in almost 3 years other than via text and even then it was her texting me and not me replying.  

She left very disappointed and that should have been the end of it.  But here is the kick in the ass.  I have now been inundated by friends, her family and hell even some of my family wanting to know why I was throwing away someone so special.  

I ended up telling my family members the truth and after they heard about it they quickly recanted and told me to tell her to fuck off.  But to her family I just said she dumped me years ago and we hadn't been together for almost 3 years.  This came as a shock to them as she had been telling them all along that we were still a couple and even when she was home on breaks would tell them we planned on marrying.  At first they didn't believe me that we hadn't seen each other in years and I'm still not sure they do.

But the friends are the ones that piss me off the most.  They know the truth and yet they think I am being ""weird"" about all of this.  They said when you are young you are supposed to play the field but if you love someone you know that in the end you will be together.  I don't have enough time to write out all of the words I said to them but I can assure you it was laced with lots of curse words.  I am now down a few friends but IMO they weren't friends really anyway.

Here is why I'm here.  I feel good and confident about my decision.  However because I have had so many people question me I am here to ask anonymous strangers this.

Am I wrong?  Should I have just accepted that she was going to play around and now that she is older she wants to settle down and start a family?  Am I just so out of touch that I don't I want to be with a person who would want to do that and then spend the rest of my life with them?

Also just for info here, there is nobody else.  It's not like I'm saying no because there is another girl, which she is accusing me of to our friends btw.

EDIT:  Wow I posted this and then went out for the evening not knowing if anyone would even respond.  I get up this morning and this thing has blown up.  There are lots of great comments and I want to thank almost everybody for making me not feel crazy.  There were some legitimate questions that were asked as well and I think I'll just answer them here instead of trying to chase down every post.

Why did I not slam the door in her face?  That really is a legitimate question, one of which I do not have a good answer to.  All I can say is that I was caught completely off guard, I had not seen her in years and I had no idea she was even back home.  So I opened the door not knowing who it was and when I saw her I froze.  I thank God I have a screen door as well because I have a feeling had there not been a barrier between us she would have tried to hug me.

Question 2 how the hell did she make her family think we were still together for three years even though we were never together, I never went to their house and there are no facebook photo's of us during that time?  Well the answer to this is simple.  I have no idea.  From what I can tell she had them convinced, because I guess she also had herself convinced, that we both agreed to the ""open"" relationship during college but would be back together permanently when she got home.  Personally I think the entire thing is fucking stupid because let's pretend for one minute that I would actually agree to this bullshit (never would in a million years) why the hell would we avoid each other for the three years whenever she was home on break.  So to be blunt either they are dumber than I thought or she has manipulated them to the point of not even questioning simple issues.

Now the one thing I guess I did not mention in my original post is that her cousin, who actually is sane and has been level headed about all of this, did tell me that she had a complete and total meltdown after I booted her off of the porch.  She said that she cried for three straight days.  I just don't get it.  How in the name of God could she be this upset?  I mean she hasn't seen or spoken to me in three years, how could she even care?  I mean that, how do you even care about someone after three fucking years?",relationship_advice
"Update - My (38f) brother (36m) stole $50,000 from me. Should I take him to court or walk away and never talk to him again?","Update from original thread:

I decided to sell the house and gave my brother the option of buying me out.  He strung me a long for a few weeks, then decided he didn't want to do it.

I sold the house to an investor. I offered my brother money to move out and a large chunk of money from the sale of the house (almost as much as he originally invested) if he was cooperative.  I haven't heard back from him about the offer.

He hasn't replied to my phone calls, texts or email.  So, I'm guessing he's pissed.  But, I believe I did the right thing, even though it was really difficult. I put myself first for once. Thank you for your advice!!!",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My [37M] Son [21M] Slept With My Girlfriend [32], I Don't Know How To Process This Level Of Betrayal","Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/98lvk9/trying_my_luck_on_this_sub_my_37m_son_21m_slept/) 

First off, I'd like to thank everyone for the enormous outpouring of support. I've had numerous people offering to their well-wishes privately and such compassion from those who commented. I believe it was this support, as well as that from my friends, that kept me from doing anything stupid. I'll try to keep this as concise and short sentenced as possible.

It's been a busy couple of days, to say the least. I unblocked both their numbers shortly after posting. My now ex called again that night, which I answered. I told her if she wasn't calling to make plans to pick up her stuff I was hanging up, and we decided on the next morning. I called a platonic female friend of mine that night and she agreed to be at my place before my ex showed up as a witness. I had everything packed up and waiting by the door. She showed up as expected and started crying immediately when I came out with her stuff, trying to pull the bags to the ground so I'd have my hands free for a hug. I put the bags beside her car and asked her to check if I missed anything, which she refused. I agreed to a quick hug, told her to take care and walked inside, my friend pulled the chair she was sitting in on my porch over so it was in front of my door, and told her that she was calling the cops if she didn't leave. She did, and I blocked her number again.

I texted and called my son numerous times, and left a voicemail telling him that we needed to talk, but first he had to come clean to his girlfriend and accept responsibility for his actions. He didn't respond, so I called her myself. We chatted for a while and she told me he was out with a friend. I asked if he had spoken to her about anything recently, and she said no. So I told her myself. Mostly because I felt it was the right thing to do, as she was a victim in this too, but I'll admit partially because he's a grown man now and needs to deal with the consequences. He showed up to my place that evening, and I let him in. I'm ashamed to say I wasn't nearly as calm as I hoped I'd be. He asked if ruining his relationship made me feel better, and I told him that he ruined it. Pretty much any hope of productive conversation went out the window and it became a screaming match, at which point I told him to get out and figure out how to deal with being as alone as I was. He slapped me in the head. This is a kid who never even threw a toy out of anger in childhood, who wasn't even spanked. As disgusting and twisted as it is, this exploded into a physical fight with me being struck in the face multiple times while trying to restrain him as I didn't have it in me to hit him, my son very much not being a fighter while in my younger years I very much was, until I took him off his feet and held him to the floor. I've never felt that level of rage before, how incredibly overwhelming it was.

When I seen the fear on his face I let him up and sat beside him on the floor. I told him to get out. He started crying and told me that his mother would be ashamed of him. This made me break down, pathetically so, and realize how fucked up this while thing has been. I agreed that she'd be ashamed of both of us, and we hugged while he cried into my chest, something he hasn't done since my wife passed. He asked if it was too late to talk, and I told him it wasn't. I cleaned myself up, we sat at the kitchen table and talked. He told me that he'd stopped therapy a while ago and lied about it, because he felt it wasn't helping. He told me that he was hurt when I kept my girlfriend from him the first year, because although he knew it was to prevent him getting attached if it didn't work out, he still felt excluded. It came out that he hid a very well concealed alcohol problem from me, and even his girlfriend. He told me he didn't sleep with her to spite me, that he was just feeling lost and he made a stupid choice. I asked him why he couldn't have been honest with me before it came to this, and he told me he didn't feel like he could be honest with himself anymore. 

We cried together again, prayed together despite neither of us being religious, looked through family photo albums together. We discussed the road forward, and we agreed that the loss we both felt went far deeper than we thought. We decided on attending therapy together, we're going to look into support groups both for his drinking and other families dealing with loss, and now that he's without his girlfriend and I'm aware of the extent of his issues, I agreed to let him move back home with me so I can make sure he attends his appointments and avoids alcohol, and hopefully so we can bond again with the stipulation that any more violence and he's out the door.

He asked me if I can ever forgive him, and I told him honestly that I couldn't, but he's still my son and I love him. And I reminded him of what his mother told him when he was a kid, that everyone messes up, it's what you do afterwards that makes the difference. I'll never forgive what he did, but if he learns from this and becomes a better person then I can forget it and have a great relationship with him regardless.

Aside from the fact my lip resembles the mouth of the vampires from Blade 2 for now which has prompted concern from neighbors and friends, the past two days have been great. We've been talking, we cooked dinner together, we've gone on walks and we're set to start looking into professional help this coming week. He's incredibly apologetic and has a tenderness I haven't seen from him in years. I have no illusions about the amount of work to be done nor how serious this incident was, but I'm feeling very optimistic about the future.

**TL;DR** Ex is out of my life for good. Son was left by his girlfriend, which led to a physical confrontation and an outpouring of honesty. The road ahead looks like it'll be long and full of hurdles, but we both seem committed to each other and getting through it together.",relationship_advice

I am working out and i will talk to her. But after this i think slowly her reality of boyfriend or life is getting out of hands with all that TV shows and all those movies she watches i also see people here are saying my BF is off, but this is just what the personal trainer messured me at.  I've lifted weights since 2011.  I would post pic but not yet while this is going on.**

Hello all, i'm a bit overweight Forgot my age. I'm 25. Male. i'm 21%Bf going down, 106kg (233lbs) . And 1.77m  tall.  I used to be 18% and 101kg (222lbs) when i met her. But over the 3year course of our relationship i've gained weight.   I went to 25% bodyfat because i stopped working out. Now i'm lifting again and gone back down to 21%bf (just got messured)  

She is around 1.63m tall and 89-91kg (198-200lbs,) last time i knew which was 4 months back she was 91kg (200lbs)  she doesn't train anything she used to swim when i met her and back then she was 75kg (165lbs) 

So you all see we both have gained a bit fat. But i'm working on cutting but i got problem with binge eating at evening.  We do not live together but i know she has been watching TV show that involes many shirtless guys, of course all with ABS.  And yesterday i was at her place, watching this TV show with her. I tried to escalate, she said she didn't want to.  I said *oh okei*  then all of sudden she asks. *why can't you have six pack?*  i told her i was working on it (for myself not her) and she said she doesn't feel as much sexually attracted to me because i'm fat.  I couldn't say a word i just awkwardly laughed.   Then 20 min later i decided to go home.

She wasn't joking she was dead serious. Ever since she started watching TV shows like this our sex has decreased.  

I almost broke up with her because i feel like she doesnt deserve me when i loose my weight, she isn't doing anything about her weight. Is this acceptable off her?

**TL;DR** GF doesn't feel like having sex anymore because i am overweight. But she is too and i'm working on loosing weight for myself but she isn't

My (28F) girlfriend (26F) didn't stop when I used the safe word.,"My girlfriend, Sam, have been together for 8 months now and I are into BDSM. Not to an extreme of the lifestyle but we like doing some BDSM type stuff in the bedroom from time to time. We've been doing it a lot as of late and it's become quite fun. We're really getting into it.

That being said I'm more a submissive type and I don't want to get into too deep of what we were doing. But let's just say I was tied up and there was a safe word we had. I started to feel uncomfortable and didn't enjoy what we were doing. 

I yelled out the safe word 3 times and Sam didn't stop. I started to yell and cry. She didn't stop until tears were visible.

We didn't talk about it. She went to shower then go to bed. I left. I'm at my place right now, and I feel so helpless. I don't know if I want to break up with Sam. She's a great woman but when she didn't stop it hurt me. I feel so violated.

I'm(26M) proposing to my girlfriend(31F) tomorrow on the day of our 4 year anniversary.,"Just saw the Feel Good Friday post and wanted to do my best to contribute. I know I'm a day early but I surely won't be on Reddit tomorrow. 

I have planned a fun romantic weekend for my girlfriend and I in Denver, CO. She knows of the trip but doesn't suspect a proposal at all. This woman is so perfect for me. We have had many issues to begin the relationship, often dealing with stupid fights and immaturity on both side. However, we have always remained committed to each other and most importantly willing to work on ourselves and be vulnerable about our flaws. I know a relationship and marriage is work and she is worth all of it. 

I just wanted to share with this community because I wanna shout it from the mountain tops. I hope everyone can find someone that makes them happy. Love is work but it is so rewarding when it's for the right person.

**Edit for those interested. She said YES!! It couldn't have been more perfect. I'm extremely grateful to the redditor that volunteered to come take photos of us and suggested Chautauqua Park. Thank you so much for your generosity and kindness sir!

My (17M) parents (45F) and (48M) bent me over their knees and spanked me for getting a bad grade on a quiz.,"I don't even know where to start unpacking this bullshit. Or if this is the right sub for this. 

My parents have always been on the crazier side. Super strict military type dad, mom who blindly follows my dads rule. His word is equivalent to that of God's and if it's not followed all hell breaks loose. 

So I'm typically an A-/B+ type student. Nothing great but not bad. Science (chemistry) has kicked my ass this year so far. It's never been my best subject so whatever. I've gotten by. But I've never gotten less than a B-  and even then my parents grounded me for two weeks. but this past quiz I got a C+. I got it Friday afternoon and told them about it Saturday morning. You'd have thought I came to tell them I'd murdered someone. Dad screaming, mom crying, threats to kick me out, promises I'd amount to nothing. The whole nine yards.

But then they really went off the deep end. My mom was sitting on the couch when all this was happening and my dad was standing to my right. All of a sudden he grabs me (he's 6'2 and muscular, I'm 5'10 and have a runners build, I'm strong but not like him) and pushes me down over my moms lap and starts spanking me. She does nothing, just sits there. He probably hits me about fifteen times before pushing me off her lap onto the ground. He stormed out. My mom continued being a spineless twit on the couch and my ass was stinging like hell.

I think I'm (28f) in an abusive relationship with fiance (31m) of 7 years.,"I'm on my phone, sorry. 
He's done a lot of mean things to me. He has hit me before on more than one occasion but only when I let things escalate to that point. I'm usually pretty good at keeping him happy and calm although I do feel like I'm walking in eggshells most of the time. 
We live together and he likes it when I tie his shoes before he goes to work. If I don't do this, or anything that he wants, he makes me feel bad. He will pout or say mean things until I do what he wants. I usually just do what he wants to avoid the drama. This includes sexual stuff as well. I have to make sure not too much time goes by between me getting him off or he complains saying he needs it to feel normal and content. He forces me to let him touch my breasts and if I resist he says my body is his body and I should be grateful he appreciates it. 
My parents are ready to move me out tomorrow. I've been staying with them since Wednesday night when he randomly started yelling at me in a restaurant, calling me a cunt and telling me to go fuck myself  then kicking me out of our apartment without my phone or anything but the clothes on my back. It's been so long since something like this happened but I think it's only because I cave to everything he wants and anticipate his needs so well. 
This is abuse, right? Even if sometimes your happy and in love? And it doesn't happen all the time? Why do I feel like I don't want to leave him even though he makes me miserable and anxious? 
He keeps messaging me asking me to come back and saying that he will change but I don't think he sees his behaviour  as a problem and he just expects things of me because I've been doing it for so long and don't complain. I feel like he's confused as to why I'm leaving because I've put up with it until this point.
Sorry for rambling. I am very upset.

I [22F] found out that my boyfriend [26M] of eight months is secretly a massive creep," 

Because I recently discovered his reddit account and his post history on here is extremely worrying to me. On a post with a gif of a young teen girl doing an acrobatic exercise he commented how she was a ""beautiful, cute nymphet"" and then proceeded to argue with another user about how it was ""perfectly natural to be attracted to girls that age"". On a post in a porn subreddit one user said how the girl ""looked 13"" and he replied something along the lines of ""I know, right? So hot. Wish more adult women had her built."" And more, comments about how he thinks young teen girls are hot.

&#x200B;

I don't know what the right term is and I don't really care, for me being attracted to girls that age is definitely pedo territory and it makes him a massive creep in my opinion. Now I don't want to stay with him any longer, obviously I'll break up with him, should I just do so without telling him the reason or should I tell him that I'm disgusted that he's such a creep and is trying to justify his sick desires online? Another thing I've wondered about is whether I should let others know. He doesn't work with children or teenagers but for instance he has friends who have younger sisters around that age and maybe he's not the kind of person they'd like to keep around.

[UPDATE] My [38M] girlfriend [32F] of 3 years owns a pornstore/strip club. I want her to sell it before I propose.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb1wh7/my_38m_girlfriend_32f_of_3_years_owns_a/

I decided to tell her that the sexual side of the store and club bothered me, and that I wanted her to sell it before I would propose. I made breakfast before she left to go over to the store for the day.

She dumped me on the spot. She said she enjoys her work, loves the adult industry, and has no plans on selling ever. She said she has worked too hard and too long for that sort of ""bullshit.""

We don't live together, so we walked through her apartment to gather my things. We gave each other's keys back.

She already blocked me on facebook.


TL; DR: she dumped me for telling her I want her to sell the club",relationship_advice
Should I [29F] divorce my [49M] husband?,"I am in a horrible situation and need some sound advice. A little background, I've been married for four years, together for five, no kids. When we met I was in the midst of a sever heroin addiction and he was my ""savior"". My mother was trying to get me to go back to rehab but he let me move in with him instead. Thank God I've been clean 3 years, but my life is miserable.
He asked me to marry him after a month of dating. A year later he basically said ""we are going to go to the courthouse and get married THIS weekend"". I told him I wasn't comfortable, because I'd only been clean a month at the time. He told me if I didn't marry him he'd leave me because our relationship is pointless. I married him because at the time I was a totally weak person and thought I couldn't live without him. I'm ashamed of it but that's the truth.
Throughout the next year I relapsed a few times, and drug him through hell. I got clean and thought the worst was behind us.
He began drinking every night. For the past two years he berates me every single night. It starts with him saying ""I hate our relationship"" and ends in him calling me fat, ugly, and telling me I'm the worst sex Hes ever had. He has stalked me at work, waiting for me in the parking lot. I had to quit my last job because of him. He called my crazy boss and told him I was having sex with his son, which I wasn't. He was just jealous because his son was young, closer to my age, and we were friends. Another job I lost because he got mad at me one night and left all of my clothes outside the front doors of my work on the busiest night of the week. He has physically assaulted me and I've told a few close friends that if I ever end up dead, it was him. He scares me. 
But the thought I keep going back to is, maybe I deserve it because of all I put him through when I relapsed. When I used I went to the deepest darkest places of hell and he went through a lot. He claims he's traumatized from all I've done to him. But I'm sick of my life with him, sick of him, and just want to get the f out. What should I do?",relationship_advice
My(23F) sister(25F) and friends(20s) talked about how I'm not good enough for my boyfriend(25M). They don't know I heard and I don't know what to do,"Firstly, my sister and this group of friends are what I would consider my closest friends. I love this girls to death. I literally tried to donate a kidney for one of them. I am 100% heart broken

My bf is an amazing guy, kind, funny, smart as hell and pretty much a model. He's just gorgeous. And asexual.

This isn't a problem to me and we worked it out. He's also very open to it and everyone knows(which I entirely support!).

We were supposed to hang out a week ago but after spending about half an hour his job called him and he had to leave. This didn't bother me a lot bc I had a killer headache and went home.

My sister and I share an ap. to save money and we have a year long lease so I guess I'm screwed.

Long story short, I closed my door, didn't light up and got a nap. Next thing I know I wake up to my sister voice. She and those friends were at our house(from what I heard they were going to a club and were drinking a bit/waiting for the others).


I didn't get up bc I was lazy and would have to put pants. Then they started talking about me. I'm not proud but I was curious.

They were talking aboyt how they couldn't believe I was dating my bf, how he was too good for me, how I was too ugly to get a guy like him. My sister then started telling how being asexual is obviously a excuse to not have sex with me.

I'm not pretty and while it does makes me insecure I know I have other good characteristics but it was very hard hearing that.

They also made fun of my learning disability(they calle the r-word, which I can't even fucking write it). That I wasn't even financially stable, made fun of my job. They said I had to beg to be fucked.

All of my friends laughed and all of them shit talked me. I was crying pretty hard at that point. They left and I didn't know what to do.

I went to bed and basically made myself scarce this week. I get up earlier, get home later or stay at my bf. I have answered their messages but was somewhat cold.

I know I have to talk with them, even if it's to just cut off contact but I can't open my mouth right now. I feel so ashamed and sad.

My bf is also worried but I can't get what they said from my head. I know it's not true and my bf *is* asexual but I feel like I'm not worth being with him.

My sister is my best friend. I fucking told her how I feel too ugly and stupid to be with him. I showed her our messages and we spoke about his asexuality. I love her so much it hurts. I can't stand looking at her knowing she was saying those on my back, and that none of my friends said anything.

I just don't know what to do. I could break my lease, I guess(even tho it would be very expensive) but I don't know how to say why I'm doing it or how I can face them. I don't know if I should tell my bf.

TL;DR: my sister and friends mocked me for not being good enough for my bf. They don't know I heard them and I don't know what to do

Edit: I can't begin to explain how much you guys rock! Thank you so much for all the advice, support and tough love, it has truly helped me and it warms my heart ti see so many people taking their time to write to a stranger on the internet

I'm trying to respond to all the comments but if I haven't please know I have read it and and considered!

I promise I will talk with my boyfriend tomorrow, we are going to his place and I'll probably just show him this post

Edit 2: hey guys, again, thank you so much for all the messages and well wishes! It truly made a moment of pain more bearable and it made me feel better to know there are so many of those who care!

I really need to sleep now but will do my best to respond to the comments tomorrow! 

Thanks everyone ",relationship_advice
"I (27M) just learned my wife (27F) lied about her past, including being sexually assaulted by my best friend.","Update:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b5t9l7/update\_i\_27m\_just\_learned\_my\_wife\_27f\_lied\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5t9l7/update_i_27m_just_learned_my_wife_27f_lied_about/)

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Also sorry for the long post.

&#x200B;

My wife(W) and I started dating about 5 years ago and got married 2.5 years ago, and we've had 2 kids since getting married.  We've known each other for over 10 years however, and I always thought she was a trustworthy friend.  She expressed her feelings for me a year before we started dating, but we had both just gotten out of other relationships and needed time to heal.  She then studied abroad for half a year.  When she got back, we hit it off and started dating within a month.  When W and I became ""exclusive"", my best friend(F) ghosted us.  I couldn't figure out why, seeing as how the three of us were all good friends, and had hung out several times since W had gotten back.  I had even talked to F about W and I possibly dating multiple times, which never seemed to bother him, he even encouraged it.  F had a girlfriend of his own at the time anyways.

&#x200B;

About a month into dating, W tells me a story of something that happened between her and F.  4 months prior, F went to visit one of his friends who was studying in a neighboring country to W.  He also decided to stop and see W for a couple days to see the country she was in.  In W's words, they went to a bar one night and she had way too much to drink.  She woke up in her bed that night to F taking advantage of her.  She pushed him off but he kept on trying over and over.  I hear this and instantly I am livid with F.  He had already been avoiding me for the past month, so I just stopped any attempt at talking to him.  I figured F stopped talking to us/didn't try to explain himself because he was ashamed of what he did.  W said she was confused about the situation and didn't really get angry about it until she had returned from abroad and seen F in person.  I had no reason not to trust W at this time and she seemed very sincere and upset talking about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

That was 5 years ago.  Throughout the years when F comes up in conversation, W always talks about how gross what he did was.  Recently however, W and I have been going through a rough patch in our relationship.  We started to fight a lot, which exclusively is always started by W.  She would complain about things I did(or didn't do) around the house, which would lead to name calling, threats of divorce, and even accusations of lying and even cheating on her(which is not true).  Our sex life went from okay(I'm the HL in the relationship) to a dead bedroom.  She blamed it on hormones(pregnancy/postpartum) but it really was getting extreme.  These things made me suspicious of her.  I thought maybe she's feeling guilty about something.

&#x200B;

So I snooped.  I know its a kind of shitty thing to do, but things have gotten bad and I wanted to know if she was hiding something.  I went on her laptop when she wasn't home, and I found all her iphone backups.  Long story short, nothing incriminating came up since we've been together.  Just texts between girlfriends about kids and whatnot.  That's a relief.  But then I found the texts from before we were dating.  I know she had some experiences when studying abroad, she's told me everything(or so I thought) so I took a peek.  And there they were, the texts between W and F talking about hooking up when they were abroad.  W saying how great the sex was, how F should visit again so they could do it again, and how she felt bad because at the time he had a girlfriend.  Plenty of graphic details that all seem 100% consensual.

&#x200B;

This honestly crushed me, and not because they hooked up.  But because she's been lying to me for FIVE YEARS about this.  She convinced me that my best friend raped her.  I've even told my family about how much of a scumbag he is, and I erased him from my life entirely.  There were plenty of other lies about her past that I found throughout her phone that just twist the knife even further.  I feel like the last 5 years of my life has been shaped by this series of lies.  Had she told the truth from the start, I probably could have looked past it.  But here I am, just learning about these things now in an entirely more complicated situation.  I don't even know how to start a conversation about this with her.  Whats the best course of action here?",relationship_advice
"(34M)What moment with your future wife made you think ""Yup, I'm asking this (28F)girl to marry me.""?","She (28F) invited me (34M) to her apartment to cook me dinner. On my way, I picked up a prescription and promptly took the first pill. Five minutes before dinner was ready, I had an adverse effect and passed out on her couch. Woke up and she was gone. Figured she went to the bar across the street we go to. Nope. As I was getting ready to leave, she returned with a fresh set of clothes and toiletries for me for work the next morning. She walked 9 blocks up the hill to my apartment, got me everything I needed for the next day, and came back. This was our second date.

TLDR: Met my wife (28F) few years back and got impressed with her",relationship_advice
Family left me (18M) when they thought I wasn't my dad's son but now they want to get back in touch,"Bunch of friends reddit, so alt

I don't think the technical details will matter a lot, so I'll get right down to business.

4 years ago, dad found out my mom had a life long affair (more than one, but that's another story). He knew about a couple of affairs she had in the past and forgave her, hanging in there for the kids, moving on, yada yada 

But that time (4 years ago), he found out me and my two siblings might not be his kids, considering time of affair.

This was the first time we all heard of mom's, well, everything really.

There was a whole DNA thing and it turned out my siblings were my dad's, and I was not.

Cool right. So dad leaves mom, divorces her, moves out, takes both my siblings with him. Not me tho

I stay behind with mom, who hits a new low finding herself alone, and we both become pretty much outcasts as far as most of the family is concerned. My older brother was particularly mean to me. We were really tight before, and the shit he did to me, I swear, had I been bigger at the time, I would have punched him hard, more than once.

I don't wanna get into details because I can't since I could be recognized, but stuff happened and I got DNA again and as it turns the fuck out, DNA #1 was messed up and and I am my dad's kid.

Now, I don't need legal advice on this. Grandpa is the man, always had my back, we got a lawyer and are looking to settle. 

But dad wants back in my life. Brother is calling and wanting to meet up and talk shit.

I don't fucking want to.

I want these people out of my life.

Mom already forgave everyone, she is going on a ""date"" with my dad and I feel sick, but not my business right

I wish them both good fucking luck, but I want none of it. Only nobody leaves me be. I keep hearing that they're family, and I ought to hear them out and give them a chance or I'll regret it later, and that the only reason I wont talk to them is cause I'm a teen and stupid or some other shitty explanation. 

So, give me some perspective here, please. Do I sound unreasonable when I say, thanks, but fuck no, thanks?

 tldr dad thought I wasn't his kid, left, turns out I am his kid, so he wants to be pals again, and I want him gone",relationship_advice
My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"So I've been with my fiance for 3 nearly 4 years and I've always known that he enjoys casually playing video games. I'm not really a 'gamer' myself but I haven't had a problem with it until now. A few months ago he started playing an online video game that's a battle royale type game where you have teams and compete against other players. At first he would just play it in the evening after work like any other game for an hour or two and then we'd watch TV or a movie while I did schoolwork. However, he then began to play it from the time he got home from work at around 4pm until 2 or 3 in the morning. I wasn't a huge fan of this because it's a very loud game and he would yell into the headset to communicate with other players which was very distracting as I was doing schoolwork and we live in a small flat so sleeping was difficult. He has started started acting very differently while playing this particular game, for example he screams and swears at other players on his team if they mess up in the game or if they lose. He will also argue with other players over the messaging system and say really vulgar stuff. I mentioned being upset once b/c he was saying stuff about rape, using the n-word, etc and he told me to calm down as he was ""just joking"" and that's what everyone does.

&#x200B;

three-ish weeks ago I came home during a break between classes and he was home during a workday. He told me his job cut back his hours to only three days a week. Since then he has devoted all of his spare time to gaming. I am in nursing school and also work so I'm gone most of the day, we have one day a week that neither of us work or go to school. We used to go places or run errands on those days but now if I can even get him out of the house he gets antsy and has to rush home to play so he doesn't ""miss anything"". He also expects me to continue doing a majority of the housework (which I have always done) like cleaning, laundry, and preparing meals. I told him I can't realistically go to school, work, and clean and cook. He will call me repeatedly at work or in class begging me to stop off on the way home and get him chips or beer. I'm pretty sure he lives off of crap junkfood because none of the healthy meals I prep seem to get eaten by him. Junkfood is expensive and since he's barely working I am trying to shop cheaply so we can pay our rent and other expenses.

&#x200B;

The final straw for me is the way he reacts when he loses in the game--he has started throwing stuff, screaming, swearing, and lashing out at me. He has broken a lamp, knocked a leg off the coffee table, and broken multiple glasses. He broke his headset and used my amazon account to order a new one. I have tried to talk to him about this and asked him to either find another way to cope or play in an area of the home with less breakable stuff in it and he told me that I don't understand how it feels to lose an important game. He accused me of being controlling and abusive towards him which was very hurtful. He also is in a group chat with the people on his team and I once saw him (i looked over his shoulder while he was chatting, which was shitty I know this) text in their group instagram chat that I was a ""nag"" and ""always bitching at him"". Even worse, a lot of the players on his team seem to be teenage boys or girls so I doubt they understand what it's like to be a in a longterm relationship. I have tried multiple times to tell him that the video game obsession is too much for me to handle, and yesterday suggested couples counseling. He has pretty much ignored me every time or promised that he'll be less aggressive on the game/limit his time. I almost dread going back to our flat bc I know he'll be gaming all night. I am aware this sounds like a very stupid problem to have, but I feel a bit like I'm living with a teenage boy.",relationship_advice
Update: Just found out my husband (28M) invited another woman over to spend the night while I'm (24F) away on business. How to proceed?,"
[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2xkpx/update_2_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

First off, I just want to thank everyone for being patient while I sort this shit out. As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0hmre/just_found_out_my_husband_invited_another_woman/), I left on a business trip, and had actual work to do. I also managed to get my account banned from r/relationship_advice because I suck at Reddit, but thanks to the helpful mods here who helped me get verified. I made the original post on very little sleep and in a very bad headspace, and honestly never thought my post would get as much attention as it did. While I read through as many of the comments as I could, I needed a few days to sort through my own thoughts, because this situation may be entertainment to you, but it's my real life, and has real, lasting consequences that I'll have to live with.

There is a lot of backstory that's necessary to truly understand the State of Our Union, so rather than post multiple updates, I've broken it up into sections. Feel free to skip over what you're not interested in, and skim what you are. TLDR; at the bottom of each section and at the bottom of the post.

# Confrontation:

Thank you to those who responded in the early hours. It was 1:30am when I posted, and I'd gotten a whopping three hours of sleep. Needless to say, I was not in the best headspace. Someone gave the advice to tell him ""I'm hurt and disappointed, I'm leaving, you need to fix this."" Someone else said to tell him that it doesn't matter how I found out, what matters is that it happened. Thank you for that, too. Both those comments really stuck with me, and I lay in bed waiting for him to wake up, typing out how I would respond to whatever direction our conversation took.

\*\*Quick side note: we've been together for 4 years, and other women have been a constant problem in our relationship. He, and many people close to him and me, all say he's not the guy to cheat. He's flirty, but he'd never cheat. He's a long-term relationship guy, and loyal to the core. That being said, he's had a history of withholding information from me because he thinks it'll make me mad, and he doesn't want me to be upset with him. I'm a pretty chill person, and honestly wouldn't have cared if he'd asked this girl over and told me about it. In the past, I haven't handled him lying to me very well, hence wanting to have a plan.

While I was waiting for him to wake up, I did something I'm not very proud of. Where I know he'd lied to me, and I wanted to have proof of the things he told me about her moving forward, especially where I'd be gone, and she was supposed to be spending the night, I set up his iMessages to come to my iPad. I know all his passwords, so I deleted the email alerts, and just added his phone number. I'm not proud of it, but I didn't have cameras at home, and needed to know whether he was telling me the truth while I was gone.

He woke up, and I decided to give him one last chance. As I was gathering my things, I asked him what he had planned while I was gone. He gave a very detailed report of his daily plans, casually leaving out anything about this girl staying the night or going to Colorado with him. I was so livid, because just the night before, we'd gotten into a pretty big fight where he said, ""And you don't trust me! I've done nothing, ***nothing*** to deserve it, but you still treat me like I'm sneaking around."" That hurt, because we've been going to therapy, and I thought I'd been doing really well at giving him the benefit of the doubt. I used to check his phone (b/c of the earlier problems we'd had) but haven't done that in months. It made me feel crazy and ashamed at the time, and now here I was, standing in our bedroom, watching my husband lie to me through his teeth.

I said, ""I know you're lying to me. I know you're not going to Colorado alone, and I know you invited a fucking 18 year old to spend the night in my bed."" And then I just waited, the silence heavy. He took a deep breath, and said he had two questions. 1) How did I know? (It doesn't matter. I know.) 2) Did I know during our conversation last night?

\*\*Quick side note: We've been having a lot of problems lately. We both have mental illnesses which are sometimes exacerbated by the other's (he has ADHD, depression, and PTSD - and I'm starting to wonder maybe bipolar of some sort, and I have PTSD, anxiety, and a number of health issues), and he's not very good at controlling his anger. Nothing more physical than throwing things or punching walls, but it is absolutely verbal and emotional abuse. I wasn't sure if it was before, but after a recent fight we had in which I asked him to stop screaming at me so I could finish packing, he said, ""You can multitask."" Yeah, I realize he sounds like a shit person. And when he's in that headspace, he is. It's very much a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde situation, and when he's kind and calm, he's the sweetest, most loving person I've met, and that's who I fell in love with. I care for him, even at the same time as I know that I don't deserve him. So the night before, we had a very heartfelt, emotional talk, in which I told him I wanted him to be happy. I could tell that he wasn't, and I thought he should go home (several thousand miles away) for a few months to figure himself out. I told him I would be his biggest cheerleader, and that if we ended up staying together or divorcing, I would always love him, and he would always be my family. We've been through some shit, both together and separately, and we were both sobbing by the end of it. But here's the kicker: I told him that if he needed another woman to make him happy, I would let him go, and support him as a friend. End of side note \*\*

As a result, I was probably pretty harsh in my response, and said, ""No, I didn't know during our conversation last night. And now I feel like an idiot, like my husband has been fucking a teenager and I just gave him my blessing."" He tried to get defensive and said that ""It's not like that."" I got really quiet, and said, ""You're a very smart man. But if you can't see that girl wants to get in your pants, you're a fucking idiot. She texts you about her taking bubble baths, and you fucking tell her about all our problems. Her. When you won't even talk about me with most of your friends, you're telling an 18 year old about all of our problems."" He said he would cancel his plans with her, and I said, ""I'm not making that decision, you are. I honestly don't know how you can fix this. I don't. I don't care if you go with her at this point. But I'm leaving, and I'm hurt and disappointed, and you need to figure out where your priorities are, because right now? Your priority isn't your wife, it's your 18 year old crush."" He kept saying he should've told me, but that he didn't want me to make him feel guilty for wanting to hang out with his friend, and that I should've known that nothing would happen. I asked him if he loved her, and his gut response was ""No, of course not, that's not at all what I'm looking for"" and said that most of the time, he doesn't even like talking to her every day because she's so immature. I told him he was an idiot if he thought she didn't have feelings for him. He tried to push back, but I told him ""I was 18 once, and I liked someone who was 28. We went on a date, but when he found out I was 18, he told me he couldn't see me anymore. I said it was fine, and that we could just be friends, but I still tried my hardest to get him to fall for me."" He was silent after that for a long time. 

That was it. He drove me to the airport. He cried a lot, and apologized a lot. I felt a lot of nothing. Heartbreak, maybe? But there's been so much turmoil in our relationship that I just didn't care anymore.

***Confrontation TLDR;*** **I told him I was hurt and angry and leaving, and he needed to figure out how to fix it. He told me that there was no sexual motivation to them hanging out, and that her spending the night was just so they could get an early start in the morning. He showed me texts where he said he would sleep on the couch and she could sleep in the bed (which is somehow worse to me, my bed is my space). He was very apologetic, and knew he messed up. He dropped me off at the airport, and things were still very uncertain.**

# The Fallout

We left things the way we'd planned to leave them during the heartfelt conversation the night before. We both planned to take the 5 days I was gone to do some soul-searching and figure out what and where we needed to be happy. Then, when I got home, we'd talk it over, and make a plan.

Well, when my plane landed at my destination, and I got a text from my husband saying that he would be moved out of our house by the time I got back, and that he's going home to the east coast. He said he was sorry to leave me to manage our upcoming move on my own, and that he knew I would be better off this way. He said he was taking the car so he could drive back, but that he'd leave me all of the money in our bank accounts, except what he needed for gas. He said he was sorry for keeping the information about his friend from me, but that our conversation last night had meant so much to him and had been such a high point of our relationship, that to wake up and be accused of cheating was a low point that he could not turn back from. He said he didn't know how to make me believe that his intentions were nothing other than company on the drive with his friend, but that it didn't matter and he would leave me alone.

I've never felt that angry, hurt, or desperate before. I was coordinating the travel of more than a dozen other people, who were on the flight with me, and it felt like all the wind had been knocked out of me. I wanted to sob and scream, but I couldn't, because I was surrounded by people I was supposed to be responsible for. I tried my hardest to gain composure, but a few tears slipped out, and I just focused on my breathing. If I'm being honest, I'm not proud of my response. I basically begged him to stay. I'd left feeling like if he needed to leave and we didn't stay together, it would be okay, but knowing that I'd be returning home to an empty house, not getting to say goodbye, and that he was ending things over ***text*** after four years together, was just too much for me. I sounded like a child, I said I needed him, that he was making a stupid mistake, that I deserved more than ending our ***marriage*** over text, all the cliches. It was bad. But he was determined to leave, and I had to get over a dozen people to our final destination, so I couldn't keep messaging him.

About an hour later, I got a text that he would at least be staying until I got back, because of our dogs. Nobody could watch them, so he'd stay until I was home, and then he'd go. We planned on having a phone call that night to talk over the specifics, but it never happened. I was too busy and physically/emotionally exhausted.

I know (from his texts coming to my ipad, but also from him telling me) that he canceled with the girl. I know that he also invited her over (which was partly my doing, w/ the texts I was getting I didn't want him to be alone, regardless of if he fucked her - then there would be no question) I know that he called his best friend and talked to him about everything for an hour and a half (which was very good, he is a phenomenal human being, and has a great marriage/advice). Husband seemed more calm and level-headed after that call. He said he would take the rest of the week to think things through, like we planned.

We didn't talk much, he texted me every day, and I sometimes responded. The week went by quickly, and I realized I didn't want to go home. I'm not sure if that's because of all the drama and chaos that was waiting there, or if its because I no longer want to be married to my husband. I don't know a lot of things anymore, and I'm trying to take each day one at a time. I had a small panic attack as he was about to pick me up. I've had worse, but I sat outside at passenger pickup, trying to breathe oxygen that wasn't there, and wipe tears from my eyes. Maybe it was the anticipation of not knowing what would happen or where we'd stand, I don't know. But when he hugged me, he got all emotional that I was home, and I just… felt so far away. You know how when you hug someone intimately, it feels like your souls are hugging? It felt nothing like that, which was new. It felt like hugging a stranger.

So yeah, now I'm home. My flight was delayed, so we both just crashed into bed as soon as we got back. I was asleep when he left for work, so we haven't talked about anything, but I'm expecting we will tonight, and I'll post an update then.

I know you may be looking for more resolution, and I wish I had it. I don't even know what I want to do yet. Part of me is ready to leave, to be done, to move on with my life. I'd want to take a good chunk of time and work on myself, but then I'd want to find someone who is transparent with me, and who understands and accepts the many parts of me that may be inconvenient, but are still me.

Part of me wants to give him one more chance. One more opportunity to get his anger under control, communicate well, and make things work. To you, reading this, it may seem black and white. But to me, living it, it's anything but. I've spent nearly every day with this man for 4 years. We've lived together for two and a half. We have two dogs, a house, a life. It's hard to just throw that all away, even if it's what ends up being best for both of us. But that's not a decision I'm willing to make lightly or on a whim. Since I left, he's been much better about following a routine, and he hasn't texted the girl at all. He did say that she IM'd him at work, and that they talked there for a bit. I appreciated the honesty, but not knowing what they talked about has me nervous. If we do stay together, there's a lot of work that will need to be done. I told him he can kiss me on the cheek, but for right now, I can't be vulnerable or open with him, or trust him at all (because of the anger stuff and things he said to me during that fight). It'll take a lot of time and patience, and I don't know if he's willing to give it.

\*\*If you want me to read and consider your comment, please don't throw him under the bus. He is absolutely in the wrong in this situation, but he's also been through a lot and I understand his behavior, even if I don't excuse it. He is ***not*** a piece of shit, even if he may be ***acting*** like one.

***Fallout TLDR;*** **Husband tried to end our marriage over text because me confronting him about his plans with the girl was too much for him to handle. He had a bit of a mental breakdown, and I told him to call her - or anyone - so he wouldn't be alone. He did, and she stayed for an hour and a half before he asked her to go home so he could call his best friend. He picked me up at the airport, but since my flight was delayed, we haven't talked or made plans yet.**

***Post TLDR;*** **confronted husband before I left. He didn't deny the plans, but denied that there was anything sexual motivating them. He canceled the plans with the girl, but then tried to end our marriage through text. There's a lot of backstory, our marriage has been pretty rocky lately, and he's got some anger issues he needs to work through. He got some help from his best friend (who lives in his hometown on the east coast), and seemed much more stable. We haven't talked much while I've been gone, and I don't know where things stand yet. He did say he doesn't even like talking to her some days, because she's so immature. Not sure if I believe him, but he seemed sincere. We're going to talk through everything when he gets home from work tonight, and I'll update then.**

Edit: Forgot to add that while I was gone, I saw messages from them on my iPad in which she admitted that ""Yesterday when you asked me about your hair I got nervous because I'd rather avoid the confrontation of this conversation. But I just have thought about certain things that completely cross the line of being friends and I didn't want to put myself in a situation that I might not get out of, if that makes sense. Idk if that does. I just didn't want to get myself in a tempting situation so I needed to put up a wall. I'm going to go do some climbing."" He responded ""that makes complete sense. I really understand. I knew I shouldn't ask, that had always just been a very comforting action for me, and I was giving into my sadness. But I admire you for doing what was best for you. I really hope you have a fun time today."" When I got back and asked what he did while I was gone, I said ""I really appreciate how you've been so open about things with her, even when they've been uncomfortable. It makes me feel like maybe I can start to trust you again."" And then he told me all of that on his own. Basically, he loves getting his head scratched when he's stressed or upset, and asked her to do that, and this conversation ensued. He didn't know that I knew about it, so it was nice that he showed some fucking transparency for once.

*Update:* Okay, I've heard everyone loud and clear. I just spent 6 hours in bed reading responses and bawling my eyes out. You're right. Every single one of you. He doesn't want a strong, independent woman, and that's what I need to be. I just got off the phone with my mom (who is an incredibly religious person, and I assumed would be unsupportive of a divorce) but she said almost verbatim, some of the same things you guys said. We made an exit plan, both for worst case and best case scenario, and I'll be talking to him tonight when he gets home. In the meantime, I'm going to go get coffee with my friend and try to calm down a bit. I've been putting myself second for so long that I deserve a bit of self-care.

My [22M] dog [11F] is a two faced sack of shit,"This is not a joke. I am upset.

I have a rat terrier, and she is a fucking asshole. Get a load of this: I have treated her like a good boi. I haven't spoiled her, I've tried to set boundaries. But my parents treat her like a living God. Like christ on earth. My Dad especially. I swear if this dog was a human he would cheat on my mom with her. I'm pretty sure they make out regularly. 

Anyway, this sack of shit is so two faced. Whenever my parents aren't around, she loves me. She sleeps on my belly and accepts all my pats. But I swear the literal nanosecond my mother or father enter the house, she completely switches on me. Suddenly she starts growling at me and bares her teeth at me if my hand goes to pet her. How dare you. 

The absolute gall of this subhuman piece of garbage. After all I've dont for you you still treat me like shit. I am literally upset about this. 

This has been occurring for roughly 8 or 9 years and I'm tired of it. Now my parents are getting older and they want me to let the dog move in with me because she is super high maintenance (she requires an extremely specific diet of feta cheese and sliced ham). It goes without saying that she has attempted to be nicer with me as of late, how rich.

If this dog was a human, I would laugh in her face. If this dog was a human I would punch her in the nose. After all I've done for you, you treat me like a chewed up dog toy, and in your darkest moment, you look to me for help? Go fuck yourself. 

Fuck you Cupcake and your stupid girly name you two-faced sack of shit.",relationship_advice
"My (35m) wife (35f) nearly died in hospital, her family doesn't care and now I don't know how to act around my in-laws","**Tl;dr** – Over the summer, we discovered my wife has a rare heart condition and nearly died. Three open-heart surgeries, two months in the ICU, and being put on the heart transplant list, and her family did little more than check in occasionally. I'm pissed and hurt, but don't know what to do about it.

So here's the story. Buckle in, it's long. Throwaway because some of her family lives on Reddit and will probably see this. If you think this song is about you...

A few weeks before Easter, my wife started not feeling well. Just breathless and really tired all the time. She went in for some blood work and they discovered she was in heart failure. It went real critical, real fast. We never even celebrated Easter—my kid's Easter basket, full of Dora the Explorer toys and candy, is still hidden in the bottom of my closet.

We went from ""nothing's wrong, maybe a mild flu that she can't shake"" to the ER at our local hospital, transferred to the city hospital, and being told that we need to get her on the heart transplant list ASAP. After a month at the city hospital, with me driving an hour there and back with our kid to visit her daily, her family had not bothered to come visit her ONCE. They lived about 30ish minutes away from the city hospital. 

I should stop here and mention that my wife and I are better off financially than the rest of her immediate family. I fully am aware this is because I had a wealthy family, good education, and a great job that lets me work flexible hours and do extra jobs on the side. Her family—mother (60s), brother (32), and sister (34)—aren't as well off. Mother works at WalMart and makes ends meet. Brother has a decent job but just in general has trouble keeping his shit together, but he tries. Sister is a stay at home mom—they budget well, but don't have a lot of disposable income. 

In the past, I have been the safety net for her family. Brother's car breaks down, we've paid to fix it. Sister has a health issue, we've paid his medical bills. We've even done some family vacations where we paid for the rental property on the beach and groceries. We never demand repayment (although we accept it when/if they do), and my attitude has always been ""money is just a thing, but family is important."" Maybe I felt this way because I didn't have any family left.

That said, I always also thought we'd be ""paid back"" emotionally, if that makes sense? I thought they'd be there for us when we needed it. When my wife first went to the city hospital, I'd drop my kid off at the mother's house in order to visit with wife. Mother insisted I didn't need to pay her for babysitting, but after the first week, when it became apparent that my wife wasn't getting better quickly and this was a long term situation, I felt bad just dumping my kid off, and instead kept her with me when I visited. 

The first few weeks, I didn't think anything of the fact that her family didn't come visit, even though they lived a little closer to the city hospital. Mother, sister, brother all work (brother with odd hours), and none of them have the best cars (or money for parking, etc.). 

Then things got progressively worse. My wife's other organs started failing. We had to speak to palliative care, which freaked me the fuck out. Eventually, the city hospital said they couldn't take care of my wife and give her a rare operation, and we'd be transferred to a major hospital 250+ miles away. I called her family and basically said ""if you want to see her before she's transferred—and maybe before she literally DIES—come now."" 

They did come that day and stayed with her several hours. I felt like a tool, because it was clear that the mother was upset and kind of freaked out and didn't know how to deal with the idea that her daughter was so sick. 

But also...JFC. It'd been a month at that point, and this was the first time they'd visited her in the hospital. 

After that, wife was transferred by ambulance to the major hospital. She spends another few weeks in ICU there, while they get her health up to as good as possible before the first major surgery. Me and the kid are living in a trashy motel—we are okay financially, but we can't afford weeks and months at a nice hotel. I'm feeding my kid nuggets out of the motel microwave and dealing with daily visits at the hospital in a city we aren't used to.

It was stressful as fuck, guys. Not just seeing my wife, who's only 35 years old, suddenly take a nosedive in health for a rare condition we didn't know she had, but also being the sole provider for my kid and worrying about her mental health as she sees her mom dying. I was torn on how much to let my kid see versus how much to let my wife see my kid... I started taking pictures and thinking about which one would be the last family picture we had together. I talked to the hospital's child psychologist for my kid. 

And also, I did a lot of freelance work, because I knew these bills were coming. My days were: wake up before the kid, sneak out of the motel bed, work, kid wakes up, get her dressed, go to the hospital, come back to the motel, try to find a way to make my kid's day bright and not depressing as fuck, get kid to bed, work until I passed out. 

Look guys, I don't want pity or to come off as a whiner, but...I was dealing with a lot in this. And I had no help. My family is either dead or living in a different state. All our friends are in our hometown, not the major hospital city. 

All my wife's family—not just the mother, brother, and sister, but also the aunts, uncles, etc.—live in about the same area. And yeah, that's a 3-4 hour drive from the major city hospital, but at most 45 minutes from the first city hospital, and the only ones who visited her there were the m, b, s, and that was only after I basically begged them to come see her. No one, not one goddamn person, visited her at the major city hospital. Not before the first risky surgery, not in the full month of recovery after it. 

Not. 

One.

Goddamn.

Person.

She's been in hospitals for about three months now. She's spent most of that time in ICU. She's had three open heart surgeries, and is coming home with implants and drugs and basically a whole new handicapped life.

And her family doesn't give a shit. 

After she had the last surgery, she mentioned, in a very quiet, sad voice, ""do you think anyone else is going to come up and visit me?""

My heart fucking broke. As soon as I left her room, I texted her whole family—all of them, not just her immediate fam. I offered my wife's car for them to drive. I offered money for gas and food. I offered to pay for them to stay overnight at the hotel. 

The mother and brother both said they'd come up, just needed to get time off work. 

Spoiler: they never came. 

The sister said she was planning to come up in a few weeks. 

Spoiler: that was last week and she didn't come. 

They all had excuses. 

But jfc. Three months in the hospital. One visit—after I guilted and begged, and only because it was at the closer hospital.

As for the rest of her extended family, I also sent them all the information on this program the major city hospital does, where you can basically send an email to the hospital, and they print it up and make it look like a card. Literally as simple as a fucking email, and guess how many of them did it? One cousin—the one member of her extended family that lives on the opposite side of the country. 

No one else could even be arsed enough to send a fucking ""get well soon"" email.

Meanwhile, my friends called and offered help. I had one friend drive two hours to spend a day with my kid so she could have a break. College buddies I've not seen in years saw my Facebook post and sent me $100 gift cards or gift cards to meal delivery and stuff. I say this because (a) it's not like I was being secret about how grave the situation was, and (b) any normal human being could see this is one of those situations where we need help. And while yes, the money helped, what we really needed was fucking emotional support or something. 

Now before it sounds like we're in a Victor Hugo novel, I should say that her family has a Facebook messenger chat thing, and they did keep up with her there. So I guess I can't say they didn't care, but...

IDK, am I being an asshole about this? I realize that they have jobs that aren't as flexible as mine, but three months. Major surgeries. She nearly fucking died. 

And they didn't come visit. They didn't even send a fucking email. 

And I saw the way she was hurt. I saw the hope fade from her eyes when she thought her mom was coming, and then she didn't. 

And I saw my kid, dragged from hospital to motel and back again, because I didn't have any help with her in the other city. Wife's sister was going to bring her kids up so that my kid could spend some time with them at the motel pool and she could visit with my wife. My kid cried when she found out her cousins weren't coming. It was the ONLY thing she had to look forward literally this whole summer---one day where she could have fun, and my wife's sister didn't come.

I always thought to myself that it didn't matter if I loaned out money or whatever to my wife's family because I could always count on them to be there for us when we needed it. 

We needed it. 

And they weren't there.

And now...I don't know how to react or deal with them. Because every time I think of them, I'm filled with rage and resentment. 

But...my kid loves them. And my wife loves them. And they're more important in this situation. I'm ready to salt the earth with these fuck ups, but my wife is recovering from a major illness and it's not like she needs drama. And I don't have family left on my side, and don't want my kid to be alone. 

So, Reddit hive mind...what should I do? I can swallow my own emotions and play nice around her family. Now that my wife is coming home soon, they all want to visit (on their sweet time, at our house—basically, now that it's not inconvenient any more). And she's happy, so I'm not saying anything. I know she's hurt by the way they didn't bother with her, but I don't feel like it's my place to put it into words: Your family is shit, and they just proved it. 

So I guess I'm at a point where I feel like I just have to grin and bear it. Maybe in the future, I'll excuse myself from being around them. I know I'm not going to be there financially for them unless it's a life or death situation. But is there a better way to act, or something else I should do? Should I bring this up to my wife--ever?",relationship_advice
My (39M) wife (39F) is being recruited by now BDSM ex-BF. What in the ever-living-fuck?!,"My (39M) wife (39F) of 8 years has recently started talking to an ex-BF (40M).  Their history goes back 15+ years but luckily we live across the country from him.  He's married now for 4 years (we attended their wedding, lol) but they have no kids.  My wife and I have two young boys, and up until now - everything was seemingly fine (isn't that always the case?).

I only found out of their recent contact since she left her email open on my computer before leaving for work.  A quick search lead to several threads that went from innocent to disgusting with a quickness.  They reminisced about their previous escapades and then things took a turn - he's into BDSM now and is trying to recruit her into meeting up and participating.  From what I've seen, she thinks ""it's hot"" and is on board.  I'd say my wife and I have an average sex life but never once was anything of the sort discussed with me (I'm not into that stuff but that's not the point).  He boldly claims that his wife and I ""don't need to know"" and it'll be their ""little escape"".  Anyway, the chances of anything happening in his city are slim since we rarely visit and if we do we are ALWAYS with family.  But there was some discussion of the ex-BF trying to arrange a work training here so they could ""meet"".   I have no idea if this has actually happened yet.

Their threads have been sporadic over the span of 3 months and I can see that some replies from her where deleted from her inbox but were included in his replies.  To me, this show all shows intent, but I'll be honest - I've seen enough.  Again, I have no proof she's actually cheated but I don't know if I even need to know.  I never thought anything like this would happen.  I've been completely faithful to her all this time, and for all intents and purposes.. a good husband?

I'm obviously distraught about this... haven't eaten in two days.. feel empty inside.  I actually cried when dropping my kids off for school today.

&#x200B;

So, Reddit - how do I approach this?  Do I mail the ex-BF's new wife the explicit conversations and let things sort themselves out from that side?  Do I simultaneously tell both? Do I just confront her and have her beg for forgiveness?  Do I let things progress and try and catch her in the act?  Do I just lawyer up now?  And the timing... her family is coming for the holidays and I could totally fucking wreck Christmas or try and pretend everything is cool for my kids' sake while being a hollow shell of a dad for the next few weeks... I'm so lost.  I feel betrayed.  This is awful.

UPDATE FRIDAY EVENING: Wow, this blew up.  I'm trying to get through all the comments now.  A lot of great commentary actually.  Somethings I had considered, some I hadn't.  Will try to respond where appropriate and then try and update this thread again soon.  As for me right now, the shock has worn off, I'm no longer numb but the wound is still open and I'm in stable condition.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE THURSDAY - What a week this has been.  Got some great and not-so-great advice here and some sincere PMs from folks who had experienced similar situations, but in the end I followed my gut.  Given the timing of everything with the holidays and no desire to derail things for my kids, I had plenty of time to think formulate a plan for how this was all going to go down.  I had all the bases covered and considered all scenarios.  I met with lawyer on Monday to discuss worst case and then scheduled an emergency counseling session for today.  I confronted my wife last night and she reacted exactly how I suspected - remorseful and apologetic - not angry and combative.  She explained that she enjoyed the attention but assured me nothing ever happened and that she had no intention of seeing any of it through.  She admitted it was wrong and totally stupid on her part.  She begged for forgiveness.  I spent the night away last night in an effort to allow myself to recharge but also to allow her to reflect on what she did and how she intends on fixing it.  She knows she broke our trust and she knows there's a long road to recovery.  She knows what's at stake here.  We have a lot of work ahead of us and it certainly won't be easy but we're now headed in the right direction - together.

&#x200B;

I know many of you were hoping for updates on swift justice or some wild kinky romp details, but at the end of the day, this was about me, my wife and our relationship and nobody - not even the Internet \*gasp\* - knows it better than us.   The moral of the story is simply talk more, listen more and be more.  Life is short.   Be honest.  Learn forgiveness.  Relationships aren't easy.  They require intense focus, input and tuning.

I (27M) Have Unknowingly Been Using My GF's (27F) Ex's Molded Dildo to Get Her Off,"Hi,

A little background: I have been with my GF for a little over a year now. We both have a kinky side to us and have an active sex life. Early on in the relationship, we talked about our kinks and whatnot. She said she was into toys (dildos and vibrators) among other things (porn, spanking, etc). This was music to my ears as i tend to suffer from premature ejaculation and incorporating toys is another way to make sure a girl can get off. So, I offered to go to the nearest adult store and pick out a couple of things. She suggested we could go together one day, but in the meantime, we can use the few she already has.

Well, the one toy she really like getting off on is a big, thick dildo. Usually we would use some toys, she could finish on the dildo and I would have sex with her. I was somewhat intimidated by the size of it (as it is significantly larger and thicker than me) and I'm smaller than average, but, like I said, I've got a kinky side and she really seemed to enjoy how big it was. We used this dildo on many occasions. A couple of weeks ago, while drinking I asked her where she got it and if it is a porn star mold. She kind of laughed and deflected. It seemed weird to me so I kept asking. She eventually admitted it is a mold of her ex-boyfriend's penis.

I was kind of floored. I've used toys on partners in the past. And when we broke up, I have thrown them out. Not only did she keep a dildo molded from her ex-boyfriend's penis, she was having me use it on her to get off. Since she told me this, I have felt humiliated. I asked her why she wouldn't have thrown it out, but she kept changing the subject and said she didn't want to talk about it anymore.

I feel like this is a huge violation of trust and respect. I'm embarrassed and don't know how to deal with the topic. I have rejected he advances once since the talk and a business trip has eaten up some of the time. We will be together this weekend and I am sure sex will be on the radar for her. I'm not sure how I should handle this.

EDIT:  Thanks for all of the responses. I will have a conversation with her tonight.",relationship_advice
Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9dwlr/update_wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out/)

&#x200B;

Hi, this is my first time posting and im not an english native speaker. Im also sorry for my mess of a text but im just at the end mentally.

&#x200B;

My \[38M\] wife \[36F\] started to become increasingly hostile towards me, the kids and her own parents.

Our kids are 12, 9 and 4 yo. I first started to notice it around one week ago when our 12 yo tripped while playing and fell on her face. I ran to her to reassure she was ok but my wife didn't really...bother? She just sat on the bench and watched me and our daughter. That evening i asked her why she showed no reaction and she shrugged it off and told me that 'I looked after her so its ok'. Thats not her normal behaviour at all and if that had happened a couple months ago she would have dropped everything and immediately look after our daughter.

A day after that incident we ate dinner and the 9 yo asked her to pass him the Ketchup. She didn't pass it but responded with 'Why do you want to eat our Ketchup?'. That caught me off guard and I was extremely baffled. He asked if it isn't also 'his' Ketchup but she insisted that its hers and her families Ketchup. I Thought she was making a joke but she looked extremely stern and sincere, so I gave him the ketchup. The rest of the day was uneventful but she kept looking at me and the kids in this... I really dont know... aggressive fassion. As if we were a threat to her.

During the last week I received only one kisse, not a single hug or any other kind of affection and even if she sometimes smiles at me, it just looks extremely forced. Sometimes she just looks at me as if she searches something. Obiously I asked her a couple times if something was wrong but she always denied it and said everything is fine. The problem is, if she was only hostile towards me i could somewhat in some way understand it. Maybe I annoy her, maybe she doesn't love me anymore or she thinks im cheating or I dont fucking know. But she also seems to hate or at least be neutral towards the children. When they talk about school she doesnt care, when they have problems she doesnt care. She doesn't tuck them in at night and i tell our kids that she's just in a bad mood and has a lot on her plate. But obiously they know as sure as I do that something isn't right. It really got out of hand when 2 days ago her mother called me, asking me if something is wrong with her daughter. Apparently she doesnt or at least only briefly answers her texts and doesn't want to meet her anymore. She told me that my wife told her that she 'isn't her real mother' which of course is something horrible to say and we both dont know why she said it or what exactly it meant. When she asked my wife why she just said that she excused herself and said that it was a joke. She never or at least rarely had an argument with her mom. We all hat a great relation up to this week and i just cant in any possible way find out what changed. It kept me up at night because my wife just feels like a different person. Now I thought about a mental illness, maybe some form of early altsheimers? But it doesn't seem to fit her behaviour. She had a depression when she was younger but thats 10 years ago. She was as lovely as one can be not even 2 weeks ago. There are a lot of other instances of her behaviour but i dont have the energy to write it down right now.

That brings me to yesterday. I sat her down and asked her if something is wrong and I need an answer now or otherwise we will see a psychiatrist. She started telling me that everything was fine and she just 'has to act as she always does'. That sentence made me feel sick to my stomach because I didn't know what it meant. Is she seeing someone? Is someone fucking holding her hostage or what is happening? I asked her what she meant but she just brushed it off again, saying that she is ok. I then told her that we're seeing a psychologist and she started screaming at me that I can't make her. I insisted so she threw a cup at me, got up and told me that she wants her 'real family' back. I don't fucking know what that means. We didn't change anything. Everything is as it was a month ago. She grabbed her purse and ran out of the house. She returned a couple hours later and told me she is sorry for how she acted. She did a complete 360 and said everything is good now she kissed me and told me she will explain it tomorrow but she is just tired now. When we got to bed later she kept looking at me as if I'm a stranger but I was also extremely exhausted from everything and just fell asleep. Its morning now and she left the house. I can't find her and it looks like she packed some stuff of hers. Some jackets, her purse 2 pairs of shoes. I called her parents, her friends, everyone she knows but they all havent seen her. Her friends told me all that they haven't had contact with her in the last week.  Should I call the police now? Have some of you experienced something similar? I just dont know what to do. I have never felt this helpless.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I called the police a couple minutes after the first people here told me to. The police responded and they took my story very seriously and said they will search for her immediately. I told them a couple places she might be. I waited at home and distracted the children, saying that their mom took some time for herself. Her parents are at my house and play with the children, they are just as destroyed and unnerved as me.

They have found my wife an hour ago at the local park, 5 hours after they started searching for her. It didn't look like she was fleeing or in a hurry but just waiting, sitting on a bench. They told me however that she was extremely hostile towards the police and punched an officer. She is now in a psychiatric clinic but im not allowed to meet her nor anyone else.

"UPDATE: My (24F) Husband's Friend (28M) Lives With Us, For Free, Is Disgustingly Filthy, Won't Clean Or Leave","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9o4ok4/my_24f_husbands_friend_28m_lives_with_us_for_free/)

**Good News!** My husband talked to him yesterday and R finally moved out last night. R gave him the following excuses: he couldn't find his sheets, he didn't have internet and that his new room mate had been out of town. I say excuses because I think it sounds like BS. R's new roommate has been living in that place for months at least, so most definitely has the internet set up. I know they are splitting the bill not having separate accounts. And I feel like the roommate being out of town would actually be a good time to get the rest of his things moved in and set up.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: R mentioned last night that he had leftover food at the new place which means he's been at the new place, I think likely sleeping there since he hasn't been sleeping here. Even if he didn't have internet, why was he still showering here in the morning and keeping his clothes here. Even if he has been sleeping at his girlfriend's house, why would he drive all the way to the new place just to drop off food?

Idk, I might just be bitter.

**Cleaning Update:** Although he didn't take out the trash last night, it is all in a bag. The bathroom is relatively cleaner because I left disinfectant and bleach all over it the day before yesterday so he was forced to wipe it up. It will need another pass, but screw it. He told my husband that he would come back today to vaccuum, finish cleaning etc. If he does, great, but at this point it is no longer disgusting so I don't mind finishing up.

&#x200B;

I am so at peace. I slept like a rock last night. And tomorrow I will change the lock. :)

Thank you everyone for all of your advice. I will use the cleaning suggestions to the max!",relationship_advice
I [27] think my dad [late 50s] is a pedofile and I've ruined my relationship with my sister [32] beyond repair.,"I don't know why I'm posting this, but I have to get this out and tell someone or I think I'm going to go certifiably insane. I can't sleep because this is keeping me up. 

The last few months its like a switch has been turned in my head. I'm getting fuzzy memories. I think they are memories at least. However they aren't clear and sort of feel like a dream at times. Part of me really hopes they aren't real. I think all started because my dad has repeatedly brought up my sex life with my husband on multiple occasions over the last few months. In really creepy and weird ways to where I'm fake laughing and trying my hardest to change the subject because my dad and I have never talked about sex. I'm 27 and married, I don't need a sex talk anymore, that ship has sailed. Him bringing it up at all, was just really out of place for our relationship and for some reason made me extreamly uncomfortable.

One memory is where I'm about 7 or 8. I'm home sick from school and in the garage with my dad helping him with stuff. I'm talking about a boy I like at school. My dad asks me if I've ever french kissed anyone. I'm confused and don't even know what that is. To put it lightly, he proceeds to teach me how to french kiss. 

Heres the thing though, I filled in a lot of blanks above. Its like peices are missing from my memory. I don't remember exactly how old I was but I remember, crystal clear, I was home sick because I had a test I didn't study for and faked not feeling well that morning. I also don't remember him kissing me, at all. I remember him asking if I had french kissed anyone pretty clear but after that its like the rest of the memory is gone. But somehow I *know* he taught me how to French kiss after he asked me that. I get a sense of feeling very uncomfortable whenever I get to that part of the memory. 

My sister is the black sheep in our family. She got pregnant in highschool, dropped out, got into drugs pretty bad, and has been in and out of rehab/mental institutions her whole life. Shes 5 years older then me. I tried helping her when I got old enough to get over my childhood mad-ness. My parents drilled it into me after she got pregnant and dropped out that she was the problem. I believed them for so long. Then I got older, got out of my parents house and realized life is not black and white. She wasn't a bad person, she was going through a bad time. I *tried*helping her. But she burned me too many times and eventually her lies and manipulation made me cut her out of my life. 

A few years ago she came out to everyone in my family saying my dad molested her. By this time I hadn't talked to her in years. My dad works a high profile job, an accusation like this would basically ruin his career. She had lied to me my whole young adult life about almost everything that it was easy for me to not believe her. I saw my dad as my hero, there was absolutely no thought in my mind that he could do the things she said he did. 

Until a few months ago. 

Another memory I have now is when I was younger, about 5 or 6, and its sort of like a ""this is how it always was"" kind of memory. Its not of a specific time but its like I'm re remembering something that was really common and happened a lot. My sister and I shared a room and at nap time she was always be in her bed next to mine when I fell asleep, but when I woke up she wouldn't be in the room. Whenever I'd go and find her she'd be dazed and not in a good mood. It makes sense. In her accusations she said he would always wake her up at nap time and they'd go to his bedroom. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't believe her. Part of me still doesn't want to believe her even though I know thats really fucked up. Ive not spoken to her in years. My whole outlook of my dad being my hero is tainted and smashed. I've been ignoring his calls these last few months, avoiding him. 

I ache for my sister. She must have went through something so tramatic and her way of dealing was the drugs. I know abuse can tear people up and cause so much mental illness problems. I feel horrible because I thought her crippling anxiety that caused her to loose every job I got her was her way of getting out of working when in reality it was her way of dealing with the abuse. I feel lucky that my mind somehow blocked it out and I really want the memories to stop because I feel like if they continue I'm going to be just as messed up as she was/is. 

I don't know what to do. Do I call her? Tell her I believe her? Do I apologize? Do I throw open the roof and accuse my dad? Or do I do what I really want to do and ignore all of this like it never happened. I know, fucked up, but I wish it never did. I don't want these memories. I miss my dad. I don't want to ruin his life by accusing him of anything that I'm personally not 100 percent sure of but I also don't want to let my sister continue to suffer and think no one believes her. And, my dad has always been very friendly to kids. Most people think hes just good with kids. But now, I think its because of this. I haven't been home in awhile, but if hes anything like he was when I was there he's making friends with the neighbor kids. If I don't say something am I forcing another kid to be abused? Was it just his own kids he did this to or did he move on to other kids when we grew up and moved out. I can't be sure of course but in the back of my head its like, I know he was too friendly to the kids in our neighborhood in light of my recent memories. It wasn't normal. 

I'm sorry that was so long. I can't tell anyone about this, I'm scared to even tell my husband because I know saying it out loud will make it all true. I know my husband would support me in anything I wanted to do, but telling him seems like this big chore that I keep putting off because I don't even know what I want to do. I'm not sure how to proceed here. I don't even have my sisters number, I don't even know what I would say. What if its too late and she doesn't care that I believe her. I've heard she's doing better and had been in a good place this last year, what if me bringing this up again hurts her progress? Maybe she's gotten past some of it and bringing it up will only hurt her? What if no one believes me like no one believed her? 

I feel like I'm just rambling and going on about what ifs at this point so I'm going to end here. I don't even know if reddit can help me with this. I know I need to see a professional but I'm scared to remember more and I'm scared to talk about this. 

Edit: It's been a rough morning. My husband knew something was off when he woke up. I told him. He agrees I need to see a professional which, with my insurance could take weeks due to needing a referral since I can't just go see one. Until then he thinks its a good idea to write down what I am remembering as I remember it. 

We've agreed not to tell my sister about this until I establish some sort of new relationship baseline. Her and I don't even know each other anymore and to jump right out with this, well it would be too much. I plan to reach out to her and slowly start talking again if shes willing. When the time is right, after I've talked to a professional, I'll bring it up to her and go from there. 

Thank you all for the advice. I think just writing this out helped me see what I needed to do.

"I want to give my (29F) live-in, introverted boyfriend (33M) a fun ""staycation"" without me","If this would be better posted elsewhere, then sorry mods and please let me know, but I think this falls under relationship advice?

My boyfriend and I live together - we don't have a TV, but I know he loves video games, especially the first person shooter kind. He has mentioned missing video games in passing, but we don't want all of the stuff in our tiny apartment on a regular basis.

I'm going away for 5 days, and I've secretly rented a TV, PlayStation, and a couple games. I'm going to set them up on the day of my departure right after he leaves for work, so he'll come home from work and realize that he has a temporary man cave for almost a week.  He knows I'm leaving, of course, but he hasn't made any plans, so I'm pretty sure he just wants to give his brain a break from his stressful job by reading at home. (Note - he has previously stated video games are also relaxing)

How can I make these 5 days even better for him, gamers? The video games will make him happy, but I love this guy and I want to go all out. Or as much as I can on a limited budget, anyways. I'm going to leave a care basket on the couch with comfy, new pajamas, a bottle of whiskey, his favorite snacks, a love note, and beer in the fridge. I was thinking of setting up some sort of pizza delivery for the first night as well?

Any suggestions or advice? 

EDIT: WOW! I woke up and found out that the internet rose to the occasion! Thank you kind strangers, for all your advice and my very first ever Reddit Gold. I am so touched by all of these kind comments, and I appreciate all of your help! I've never had a bigger smile on my face first thing in the morning. 

Here are some of my takeaways so far, but I'll still be combing through all your comments since there are so many gems:

- I won't go too overboard and focus on quality instead of the quantity of things I can do for him
- Luckily, he's already mentioned some of his favorite games, so I've taken note, and I'm going to the store tomorrow to get those. I've rented a PS3 (they didn't have a PS$ available, alas) and I'm working on securing an Xbox One as well
- Part of the package will be him trashing the place, and me happily cleaning it up when I get back.
- I'll make sure all the games are installed in advance (thanks guys, I would have never thought about this)
- I think I'll just leave him an UberEats gift certifcate in addition to making some home-baked goodies instead of trying to coordinate pizza delivery
- I'll include some sexy talk in the note I leave him, telling him allllllll the things we're going to do when I get back
- I'll hook it all up to the internet so he can play multiplayer if he wants
- I've rented the gaming consoles for an additional day so he and I can play together when he gets back. I don't really play video games, so I'm just gonna get my butt whupped over and over again. Any gamer tips will be highly appreciated. ",relationship_advice
My [32 M] best friend asked if I would be her [30 F] sperm donor for her surrogate and I am in love with her but she has no idea.,"So for a bit of background we met in college and have been best friends since then. We hooked up once years ago,It was a drunken exchange and I honestly chocked it up to we were both drunk and in the right place.

She got ovarian cancer that was stage three a few years back and survived and has been in remission however she had to have a complete hysterectomy. She had mentioned a year ago she was considering surrogacy. She had told me she planned to use a donor as she has been single for a while.

Thing is I am in love with her and I have been for years but she has no idea. I know at one point she had feelings for me but I was seeing someone then and out of respect for my gf at the time she never acted on it. 

I feel like before I give her an answer which will be yes I should tell her how I feel. 

I want to make her dream of motherhood come true and I am honestly touched she thinks so highly of me she wants me to be the father. 

Regardless of how she feels, I will still donate and If she doesn't still feel the same way I will love her as my best friend.

Guess I am trying to find the best way to ask her and came to reddit for advice     

So how should I handle this?

"UPDATE - my best friend (18F) cheated on her bf, got pregnant, said that he's the dad. Don't know if I should tell him","First post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf5ltj/my_18f_best_friend_18f_cheated_on_her_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Sooo I told Natalie that she has to either tell eric or I will. A shitty ultimatum. but I was very serious and even typed out a text to tell him and showed her. She said she was very certain it was his baby since apparently she only fucked Dylan PIV like three times, I guess I kept walking in on them and assumed it was more frequently than it was. But she told him herself. Which was a relief since I couldn't do that. She told Eric that she wasn't loyal but the baby was his and he was angry anyway and he broke up with Natalie. The thing was she was supposed to move in with him and all that so her plans were ruined. But yeah I guess he didn't care after all if that was his baby or not since she cheated. Idk she was really sure that he was the father but neither wanted to pay for a paternity test since it's expensive. Listen idk she said Dylan pulled out but she lets eric finish inside since she's usually on birth control. 

She also cut our friendship after all that and hates me now. I asked some of our other friends and she's probably gonna get an abortion because she can't do it alone. Dylan found out and thinks it's his baby and wants to be there for her but she basically told him that he's nothing to her and fuck off and never talk to her again. He still likes her , I don't know why since she's mean to him and he could get any other girl but he liked her since elementary school. 

So yeah. Everything kinda sucks. I was looking forward to being an auntie. And I lost my best friend. Can't believe she's having an abortion. I wish I could be there for her to help her thru it since I know she's scared but she hates me now. But my boyfriend is not too mad about her ditching me, he thinks she's crazy after this lol yeah she's crazy but idk she was scared and didn't know what to do",relationship_advice
UPDATE 'I won't move in with my boyfriend because of my cat',"First off, let me say I'm still shaking so if this is a rambled mess I am sorry. All your kind words from yesterday made me cry, thank you all so much. I thought I would give some back story to how my BF and I met. It was through a support group, as I mentioned. Growing up, (until age 7) I had a very abusive dad. When I was 7 he tried to kill my mother and I, luckily the cops intervened and they took him away. My mom charged him and he got put away. When the trial was done, we moved, and my mom gave me Moomoo (don't judge the name, I was 8), from a local shelter. I didn't fit in at the new school, And moomoo was the best thing in my life. Back to the support group.

I shared my story, and my BF confronted me after saying he also had abusive parents growing up, and we bonded over our similar situations. I didn't realize how much control he had over me until recently. He convinced me to stop seeing my therapist, we also stopped going to group. He used to tell me what to wear, how to style my hair (it's very curly, and recently I've been straightening it because he would always say it looked better). 

A few hours ago, I invited him over for lunch and to talk. Luckily, moomoo was in my room sleeping. I told him what you guys said, saying that if it was his dog he would be upset. He blew up. He told me that wasn't the point. The point was I wasn't committed to him, or didn't care about us. He started throwing things (a glass, some books I had lying about, and some picture frames). It was terrifying. I had never seen him this angry before, and I just reverted back to what I used to do as a kid. Curl up, cover yourself as much as you can, stay quiet. Bless my roommate, who came home during this fit. She had brought the security guard because as she was walking in she heard the shouting/items breaking. My BF was escorted out, as he left I just screamed ""don't come back."" I hope it sticks.

I've blocked his number, and my landlady has been notified not to let him in, as have the guards. Next step is neighbours. I don't really know what to do from here. I emailed my therapist, hopefully she will let me come back. My mom is on the way over right now, and my roommate is with me too. I'm so terrified. I didn't realize how much control he had over me. I thought all his early behaviours was just because he had clingy issues from his own upbringing. 

I'm going to have a bath, relax, let my hair go curly again, and cuddle my baby. I'm really glad Moomoo was in my room.  Thank you all for the help. I didn't think any of this was wrong until you guys brought it up. I still love him, and feel bad for him. He had a shit upbringing too, and I'm sure he's messed up from it, but I'm going to try to move on. After my cat dies, I'm going to move out from this place, to somewhere he doesn't know about. Thank you all again. 

edit for everyone who wants to see moomoo (copy from another comment):
I don't want to be identified incase anyone I know or in the future know find this- that's why I made a throw away, as I do have a regular reddit account. 
Imagine this: pretty big tomcat, mainly white with three huge black spots on his back, leg, and side of his head. Minus the back right leg, and yellow eyes. 8 year old me thought he looked like a cow, and cows moo, hence the name 'moomoo'.  He's pretty derpy, but hes mine. 

Edit 2: moved to tears again by all your comments. Thank you. I'm going to log off this account now, and hopefully never have a reason to use it again. Thank you all so much for the help, I love you all. ",relationship_advice
My (F30) fiancé (M40) is going on a trip with his friend (F27) for his bachelor party. My jealousy ruins every happy feeling towards the wedding.,"(Please read my edits in the bottom)

Ok, so my fiancé has just one good friend and that is a girl he met through work about 7 years ago. (We have been together 3 years) There has never been any romantic feelings between them and I believe him because when I see them together they display a very sibling-like relationship. 

He proposed to me in september and we are getting married in may. And because he only has this one good friend, she became his best man. And she has planned an overnight trip to a city with a stay at a hotel. They are going to sleep in the same room, probably even in the same bed and I'm finding myself becoming very jealous, so much so that I want to cancel the whole wedding.. And I hate that I feel this way, because I KNOW they would never do anything wrong. 

I think the problem is a few different things:
1. My fiancé is not very fond of traveling or doing something new. So it's rare for us to go on such trips and I become selfish and would have liked for us to go together instead. 

2. She is much more pretty, funny and have a lot more self confidence than me. So I'm afraid that a trip with her would remind him of the ugly, depressed and boring girl he has waiting at home. 

3. And even though I'n not afraid that he will have an affair with her, it's still painfull knowing he will be that close to another girl. 

I work really hard with myself and my negative thoughts every day, but this is just too much. 

Could someone give me a virtual slap in the face? 
I just want to feel some joy about my own wedding. :(

EDIT: I have told him that shared room is ok, but that I'm not ok with shared bed. I don't want to lay down a lot of rules for him. I'm not his boss and I trust him/them. And he has agreed to theese terms. 
But oh my god, these few weeks until that trip will be hard nevertheless.

EDIT 2: Okay, thanks to all of the replies I got from you guys I sat down with my fiancé and told him about how upset this made me. I said that I would not deny him anything but I made it clear that this was hard for me. 
He got very affectionate and said that he did not want me to be upset. He is going to talk to his friend and tell her that he will not spend the night with her. The bachelor trip will have to be a day-trip without a sleepover. 
So he respected my feelings and made a compromise that made me feel much better! :) Just a reminder to myself about what a nice man I'm marrying.",relationship_advice
My (22f) coworker (40+m) bought me flowers for my wedding. How do I thank him?,"I work in an office setting and I rarely interact with my coworkers. My job involves a lot of time-consuming, individual work so I have almost no time to bond. Somehow, one of my coworkers got wind that I was getting married soon.

He caught me when I was walking to my car after work and asked for my opinion on floral arrangements. I, being an idiot, gave my opinion and didn't connect the dots until he said ""Do you have flowers for your wedding?"". When I protested he said ""I've already ordered them, I'll send them to your house the day before the wedding. This is my wedding gift to you."" He said something else about how it's important to him that I start my marriage off on the right foot and he walked away.

I drove home in tears. When I told my fiancé he was in disbelief. I don't know what I did to deserve such kindness.

I'm so touched that he went out of his way for me. I want to thank him but I don't know how?? A wedding thank you card seems like it's not enough and giving him money seems disrespectful?? Help.

&#x200B;

Edit : My coworker and I are from a culture where the bride + groom are expected to wear floral accessories during the ceremony. I didn't have this as I'm a broke baby and my fiancé isn't part of my culture. I was planning to do a more westernized ceremony and yes, it did make me sad that I wasn't going to be getting married the way I wanted. I don't know how my coworker figured out that I didn't have these accessories yet but he did.

Edit #2 : Wow so many nice people!!! Thank you to everyone for the congratulations!! I'm excited to celebrate my union the way I originally wanted to thanks to this nice man (whom I will thank properly).

Update: I reached out and invited him to the wedding. Unfortunately, he and his wife can't make it but he appreciated me asking. I will absolutely be sending him a thank you card featuring the flowers. Someone mentioned giving him a pressed flower from the arrangement and I love the idea so we'll see.",relationship_advice
My (25M) girlfriend (24F) of 2 years doesn't want to get rid of a bedbug infestation.,"We just signed a lease last month to start living together in a new place. Well, we had a housewarming party that got a bit bigger than we expected, with some friends of friends we didn't know showing up. More than 20 people in total. We suspect the bedbugs came from someone at the party. We've had them for more than a week now.

My girlfriend refuses to cooperate in getting rid of them. Because she doesn't believe it's okay to do so. I'd always known she was a very compassionate person and truly views all living things as precious and important, volunteers for a few humanitarian causes like animal shelters and loves nature. But I didn't know it went this far, that eradicating pests like this is wrong. This is very extreme to me.

Meanwhile, we are getting eaten alive every night and they just keep multiplying. I'm out of patience, I've asked her many times how she can stand living with this, she just says it's ""annoying"" but she couldn't bring herself to intentionally kill anything. Even a fucking bedbug.

Today I decided I was done with this bullshit. I called an exterminator and scheduled an appointment for tomorrow. When I told her, she flipped. I said I didn't care what she thought, she could help me pack up everything to prepare or not but it was happening. Then once I went to work, she cancelled it behind my back! She texted me to tell me. She said she doesn't want to fight with me, that we should be able to ""live in harmony with each other and other creatures""!!! She also said she's really stressed due to our disagreement about it, but I'm stressed from having the bedbugs!

Now I'm about to go home to our infested apartment and confront her. Please help. I feel like my life has turned into some realm of insanity. How do I make her understand that the pest control needs to happen??

TL;DR: My girlfriend sabotaged my efforts to exterminate bedbugs in our home because she strictly believes it's wrong to kill them. I don't know how to make her stop or compromise.

Edit: we're fucked. She got home today and said she got fired. She works at a daycare and they found bedbugs there today, then she straight up ADMITTED they were from her. Because she was trying to convince the other staff that there's ""natural"" ways to get them to leave! What ways? I've asked a million times and everything she says is bullshit. Some of it I sourced to quackery sites riddled with fake health information and conspiracy theories, some she claims ""someone told her"", the rest I honestly think she just made up. Anyway they let her go after she tried to argue with them. I am just blown away by her idiocy about all of this. There's no other term for it. So now I've lost a LOT of respect and trust for her. It sucks. I always admired how humanitarian she was but jesus this has taught me that everything needs to have limits. And that even good impulses can be crazy and harmful in effect.

That's not the only thing. I went and talked to the other tenants last night after reading some of these comments. Welp they've all been finding bedbugs too. The entire house is infested. As if my girlfriend losing her job isn't enough, I just got off the phone with the landlord. She got the complaints from the other tenants and knows we're the source of the infestation because we were the first to report it. I'd informed her I was having it taken care of after I scheduled the appointment my girlfriend ended up cancelling. So now, I had to tell her why it never happened. She was really pissed off and said she would have covered that single-time extermination assuming we were going to cooperate but now that my girlfriend fucked it up and the whole house is crawling with them, it'll be probably THOUSANDS in expenses. She told me she's going to be looking into holding us liable for the cost. I'm so absolutely fucked. I don't have thousands of dollars lying around. Neither does my girlfriend who's fault it is, and as of today nor does she even have a fucking job. I am so mad I don't even know how to deal with her. She's out right now and idk when she'll be back, she's avoiding me. 

I don't know what to do. I just need to move and get the hell out of here asap. I do not think I will be inviting her along with me. In fact, I don't think I can even stand being in a relationship with her after this. Unless she shows some serious sincere understanding of the shit she caused. But I know her values and way of thinking, and she's very stubborn. It's not going to happen. Goddamn even ruining our lives probably won't make her change.

Anyway. Gonna go build a time machine so I can have never moved in with her, there's basically no other way to fix this.

Edit 2: I commented a reply to someone that got a bit long, copying it here. (TL;DR I broke it off with her)

Honestly, yes she used to be pretty hot. Last few months she's been gaining weight and got fat now. That's just extra incentive to leave I decided. Realistically I don't think I could possibly not have this whole clusterfuck be the first thing on my mind whenever I'm around her. I'm so pissed off. I'm getting a consultation with an attorney first thing tomorrow to see if/how I can legally protect myself against landlord's lawsuit for damages so that it's her responsibility. I already told her I don't want to see her. I don't care if she goes back to the apartment, she can have it. I've left everything there except my electronics and some personal items. They can burn it all, I don't care. As of tonight I'm temporarily staying with a very generous friend (after thoroughly showering at the gym, of course) who I'm unspeakably grateful to. It'll be a pain to replace my clothes, and furniture once I find a new place, but I know where to get cheap shit that will do for now. I have some emergency savings. Guess this is exactly the kind of thing that's for. And fortunately I still have my job which is more than she can say.",relationship_advice

She usually does not behave like this.  i left the room and she followed me (she grabbed my arm) and said that I shouldn't be ashamed of being a virgin because it's ""cute"" (?)  and that it's ok. Afterwards she laughed and said ""if you tell anyone about this, I will kill you"" and walked off.

Edit2: whoa this blew up as far as my Reddit standards go. I'll try and respond to everyone. I posted this expecting to be told I'm going over board but feel better knowing I'm not the crazy one. Again thank you all

Back story: Wife and I have a 3 year old daughter. Wife has been getting her master's for 2 years. ( I work as a cyber security analyst) Our relationship is on the fritz for various reasons.

My dad duties include the following: Feed my daughter dinner every night, give her a bath, read her a bed time story. Lay with her until she sleeps. I've done this her entire life and don't expect a gold star for doing what dad's are supposed to do.

My wife has been getting her master's so she sometimes comes home late for school, working out or getting drinks with friends. I drive my daughter to daycare ( attached to my job) everyday. ( Again not asking for sympathy as this is what dads do.) I get home and don't get time to breathe until my daughter is alseep. She has the freedom to say oh yea I'm going out tonight I'll be back late. I don't have that freedom.

I pay for a majority of the bills. At one point it was all on me to pay for daycare AND her car payment. To say I'm stressed all the time is an understatement. My family and her had a falling out a year ago. So if I want to go somewhere or do something it's my responsibility to take my daughter to to my parents. 

Her mom duties are to get her ready in the morning. Make breakfast/lunch for my daughter. 

Trying to initiate sex with her is brutal. She's so either too tired and not in the mood. She only wants to have sex when she comes home drunk with her friends. Outside of that she would never try to have sex. If she does it's "" can I just lay on my side I want to sleep"". 

Yesterday she goes oh going out tonight with my gym friends. Be back late. Doing nightly dad  duties every single night is exhausting. So when she tells me this I don't respond to her texts.  So annoyed with her that I just didn't want to talk to her to cause another pointless fight.

She gets home and starts making out with me ( only when she's drunk). Lays on me asks let's go have sex. I tell her no. WW3 ensues. ""WHO ARE YOU FUCKING. WHO DO THINK YOU ARE YADA YADA"" Mind you no is her middle name. 

We argue. Her response is you don't care about yourself. You don't dress well and genuinely care about nothing outside of my daughter. ( I have my demons and think I am battling serious depression) So I understand she's not 100% to blame but still. I walk on egg shells in my house in fear my wife will cut my dick off. If she's stressed she uses me as her punching bag. I'm not sure what to do. Trying to talk to her is dangerous as she freaks out whenever I try to talk to her about stuff.",relationship_advice
How do I (27/M) approach/confront a friend (26/M) who has beaten and raped his partner (25/F)?,"I learned from my wife that my friend (26/M) has been beating and raping his partner (25/F), almost the whole time I've known them (3yrs they've been together). The share a 1yr old child, but apparently this abuse has been going on since before the child was born.

I never noticed any signs, abusive behavior while seeing each other on outings or at parties, so this is a shock to me. I don't know if I can be friends with someone who does this (I should just straight up be not being mates any more) but feel confused.

How to I confront him? Do I say ""I hear you've been abusing your missus"" or do I broach the subject more lightly? I dont want to piss him off, that said I've never felt physically threatened by him or his demeanour. But I must confront him. 

TL;DR - how to confront a friend who abuses his partner?


*edit - it should be noted she and child are safe in womens refuge with a protective custody order against him.",relationship_advice
My (31M) wife (37F) will no longer let me pursue my hobbies.,"Exactly as the title implies, she says I am not allowed to pursue my own hobbies anymore, as they are ""unhealthy"".

Before our marriage 7 months ago, I was interested in all sorts of things - playing video games for at least a few hours per week, collecting Star Wars figures (some may say that was a bit childish anyways, but I enjoyed it none-the-less), painting Warhammer 40k, etc. These are things that I had done since my early teens.

My wife wanted us to make healthy life-style changes after our marriage, which at first I took as just eating healthier, exercising, etc. I was totally on board for it. Everything was fine until I went down to the basement one day and noticed all of my Star Wars figures gone from the display shelf. All that remained were some limbs from a few of the figures.

My wife was at work, so I sent her a text asking what happened to them. In the meantime, I rummaged through all of the garbages and finally found the figures in the bigger garbage next to the garage. Most of the cards were torn up & the figures dismembered, while others were completely burned or melted. I took a picture and sent it to her, asking if she did it.

That night, after not replying to any of my texts, I confronted her. It turned in to a huge argument about how my hobbies are immature and that she was repulsed by them, even threatening to not have sex with me until I gave them up. In the heat of the moment, I agreed with her, if only to get her to stop yelling at me.

We haven't talked about it since, and I've unfortunately been abiding by her ""rules"" for the past 7 months. Though I've been secretly playing video games, buying figures, etc (she only found out about it one time, and she destroyed it immediately). I can't keep this up any longer, I want to have my own hobbies without her getting upset.

What is the best way to bring the subject up again & how can I let her know how much my hobbies mean to me?

TL;DR - My wife won't let me pursue my hobbies and I don't know how to come to an agreement with her.


EDIT: Thank you all so much for the words of support & guidance, it truly means a lot. Getting a different perspective on this has made me realize that she may be going through some internal or mental issues. She was the love of my life before all of this, and I am not going to give up on her by just getting a divorce without knowing the reason for her acting this way. I'm going to ask if she would be willing to go to a therapy session and move on from there.

EDIT #2: Currently at my best friend's house, drafting an email to send to my lawyer first thing in the morning. I had decided to hook my Xbox up to the living room television and gauge what my wife's reaction would be when she came home from work and saw me playing. She immediately went to our bedroom and slammed the door. I walked in on her angrily texting something on her phone before she screamed at me that I was going back on my promises, and that playing games is unhealthy. I kept telling her that I deserve to have my own hobbies, and she told me that no real husband has those kinds of hobbies. I basically told her that she was free to go find a real husband, and I packed a small bag and drove to my friend's house. I feel kind of relieved, but also sick to my stomach. I will keep updating when I can, you are all so supportive and deserve to be kept in the loop.

EDIT #3: My wife has been texting me non-stop, asking where I went and telling me to come back to the house. She even claimed she was pregnant and that I was abondoning my own child, only to backtrack a few minutes later. I'm making sure to save all of these texts in case my lawyer thinks they could come in use.

EDIT #4: Spent the morning talking to my family and a few of my other friends about the situation. They all agree that a divorce needs to happen, whether or not she is mentally ill. My sister even said that she had a bad feeling about her, but saw how happy I was and didn't want to impose at the time. My lawyer has suggested not to confront or communicate with my wife until divorce proceedings can be put in to motion. Currently going to my house while she is at work to gather my valuable belongings.

EDIT #5: Not sure if anybody is still keeping up with my post, but I figured I would give another update. The divorce proceedings are currently underway. My (ex) wife has been incredibly apologetic for not only the main incident in my post, but also for how she's been treating me in general. She has also agreed to pay me a lump sum for the figures (we came to a mutual agreement in terms of the value). Overall, she has been acting surprisingly reasonable throughout all of this. I feel like this is a positive turning point in my life. Thank you all for giving me the courage to finally take action.",relationship_advice
"I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving"," I AM ONLY POSTING THIS SO PEOPLE HAVE A BACKSTORY AS TO WHAT HAPPENED, THE MODERATORS ON RELATIONSHIP SECTION DID NOT WANT ME TO POST IT THERE SO THEY DELETED MY POST.

HERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE POST

BELOW IS THE POST I MADE FIRST:

Dont know how to explain all of this, basically was snooping around last night when i saw her phone ticket off, it was a message from her friends about the party. I stayed up like one of those stalkers you seen on tv and been checking the computer, fb messages with her friends and found iut she cheated during her bachelorette party. By cheating i dont mean getting a strip tease or something (which i would be ok with, i understand its a bachelorette party) but she actually gave a stripper a blowjob and ended up going home with ANOTHER guy that night.

She has this other guy added on facebook but the chat merely consists of a ""had a good time and it was nice to meet you convo, which dates back to the bachelorette party. i have however read the messages between her and her friends, they have a small group, found out what shed done there.

it all seems as if it was a one time thing that happened then but im a fucking mess. i havent slept all night and she is headed for work in an hour or so when she wakes up (its almost 6 am here). I dont know what the fuck to do, we are supposedly getting married in 3 weeks.

I am thinking of simple packing all my bags after she is going to work and just leaving the flat, its her familys flat anyway, we were planning on buying a fucking house, having kids, grow old. i feel i want to throw all of that out the window. i am sitting here smelling like alcohol, feeling drunk and depressed. i dont know why but im more of a angry depressed than sad depressed, i havent criend since i found out about all of this.

should i confront her? should i just get out? should i hear her side of the story? honestly i want to just go and stomp her fucking face in right now but i dont wanna do something rational.

please help!

sorry for the typos, im typing from my ipad and am not in a good place in my head right now (also, i am european, not english)

Edit 1: I have been reading all comments, both good and bad. Didnt expect this amount of response, but i think i have my mind set on just leaving. I will probably do so while shes at work, i really dont know. I feel alot calmer already, really appreciate everyones comments. Not going to drink anymore or do anything stupid. I will try to update the post to let you know whats happening.

Guy (23M) i'm (25F) dating kept ex's used tampons,"Okay, you are really going to have to go with me here...i still can't quite get my head around it. I was at this guys apartment after we had seen a movie and he went out to the store to get us some condoms, as he realised he didnt have any. I know its bad to snoop but i felt like i wanted to get to know him better...we have only been seeing eachother 3 and a half weeks. Long story short i opened the bed side table drawer next to his bed, which had a clear jar in it with four used tampons in it. Obviously at this point i froze, trying to find a logical explanation as to why they could be there.

He gets back and i confront him about it. He really went off at me about snooping...but eventually said that they were his ex's tampons, and that hes got a thing for periods. The worst part is she doesnt even know, he used to fish them out the bin to keep so that he could look at them later. Obviously im not seeing him again, but do i tell his ex what i found? I know who she is and i feel like i have some sort of responsibility to tell her

I'm feeling a lot of anger about this child[M5] of my[M39] wife's[F39] affair that I've been talked into being a father figure for.,"This post is about me\[M39\], my ex wife \[F39\], our two sons \[M7,M9\] and the affair my ex wife had that resulted in the end of our marriage as well as a third child, we'll call Max \[M5\].

I've been thinking about posting something like this for a few days, I have to admit that reading the recent post by  [u/throwawaynocollege01](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaynocollege01/)  is the thing that's pushed me to sit down and try to type this out. I think that what I want to talk about is parenting stuff, but I'm going to start by talking about the affair and dissolution of our relationship.

My wife confessed to the affair about a week after telling me she was pregnant. So, you know, a week I'd spent excited, about what I thought was going to be my child. Turns out, no. It was an emotionally pretty traumatic time. I might have been able to work through the infidelity but made the ultimatum that she had to end the pregnancy. She was philosophically opposed to abortion and I knew this. She stuck to her morals in that particular instance and so I initiated a divorce. She has since married her affair partner.

Regarding custody of our sons, there was a period of more conflict and resistance, I took the boys in the initial period of Max's infancy, and in the initial highly emotionally injured state I was in I sought full permanent custody, but I wasn't likely to be successful and I was eventually persuaded that despite the breakdown of my relationship with her that it's in my sons' best interests to have their mother in their lives. Today, to the amazement of everyone else in my life, my ex and I remain co-operating partners in the parenthood of our children.

For the last two years we've shared week to week custody of our two sons. This upcoming school year Max is going to be old enough to attend the same school. About a month ago I got sat down by my ex, her partner and all three boys and they all want Max to travel back and forth with the boys each week and effectively live with me 50% of the time. Seriously.

There are some arguments for it, admittedly. The 3 boys are friends and brothers as much as I resent it, splitting them up regularly does seem like a weird sibling dynamic that could have poor consequences. I'm angry with my ex for broaching the topic with the boys before me, but it's also an entirely reasonable thing for the boys to have an opinion on. I agreed. What was I supposed to say? No? Why Not? I can't say ""Because I hate that Max exists"". So, I said ok.

I do hate him.

I know he doesn't deserve to be hated. I know he's no more responsible for the circumstances of his conception than any of us. But knowing that doesn't seem to matter. He's a walking talking reminder of all the worst emotions that I've ever felt. I'm coming to end of his second week staying with us and the boys, we have moved him into my home and made space for him. I hate the sound of his voice. If he needs help in the kitchen, I am immediately annoyed with no good reason. I'm constantly angered by his limitations, limitations that are entirely in line with being a 5 year old, things I would never get angry with my sons over. I'm short tempered and just energized with this useless visceral anger.

I feel like the last years of my life have been a carousel of humiliations and degradations. The only way I've been able to keep everything together is constantly repeating to myself that pragmatic argument that no matter how authentic my grievances are and no matter how justified I am in my anger, it doesn't help me or my sons for me to devolve into an embittered rage hermit. Just hold my tongue, breath deep and force myself to do the thing that will actually help. So I remain in regular contact with their mother, and I talk to her politely, on the topics that I have to. Since recognizing that I don't have the legal power to exclude him from my sons' lives I have been cordial with Max's father. That I've been able to do these things has been the only thing about myself worth feeling good about.

But maybe it's not worth feeling good about. Maybe I regret being civil. Because in Max's presence that pragmatic argument is just not enough. It's like all the anger I've set aside through sheer force of will returns at once and possesses me while I have to talk to him. I thought I was doing the right thing, but if I had remained combative and negative, I never would have ended up in this position.

What do I do? I'm constantly thinking I want to back out, to say ""no, I can't do this, I'm sorry"". But how could I justify that? No one else in the situation will be happy with that. The boys certainly don't understand why there would be a reason for them to be treated differently based on their parentage. My oldest has told me so explicitly, in a moment that made me feel both proud of him and ashamed of my own anger. Their mother and her partner would be upset. Part of me doesn't care, and bitterly assumes they're just trying to get some free time for themselves out of this, but I'm trying not to dwell on that. My ex makes good arguments that this is in the best interests of all of the children. But part of me just remembers how long she lied to me and how totally I trusted her in that time.

It seems like the only thing to do is the same thing I've ever done, suck it up and get over myself and my anger. But if I do that, then I have to actually do that. Even if I'm being a responsible babysitter for Max right now, he deserves to live in a home where he is loved, not merely tolerated. Can I do that? Maybe I can't do that. I'm scared of a path forward where I can't work up the nerve to backout of this arrangement and consign myself to getting over it, and then I actually don't get over it, but rather dwell ever angrier with how my life has turned out and take it out on the undeserving around me.",relationship_advice
"My husband's [M32] ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and I [F30] want it to end right now.","We're both early 30s, married, no kids. We own a house together (mortgage).

&#x200B;

My husband worked for the same company for almost a decade. He earned a good salary, but the last few years were rough on him thanks to his overbearing boss. He discussed quitting every so often, and I was open to the idea as long as he had another job lined up.

&#x200B;

Well last year, he quit spur-of-the-moment over a seemingly minor dispute at work. He would later call it ""the straw that broke the camels back"". No other jobs lined up, nothing. He assured me that he had savings he could live on and that he wanted to take some time to ""re-calibrate"".  He also 'had a few business ideas' he wanted to pursue before getting back into the workforce. Trying to be a supportive partner, I said okay...

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today -- he has no income and literally hasn't sent out a single job application. He hasn't even updated his resume. What has he been doing these passed 8 months, you ask? Smoking weed, a bunch of scammy 'work-from-home' bullshit that hasn't made him a dime, and most recently, trying to become an 'Instagram Influencer'. Yes, seriously. 

&#x200B;

To be fair, he has also done some handy-work around the house and fixed up some things. But for the most part, he spends his days smoking weed and dicking around on Instagram, and I'm effectively subsidizing it -- we used to split bills 50/50, now it's more like 80/20.

&#x200B;

The last time I tried to have a serious talk about his future plans, he ""jokingly"" said I could divorce him and pay him alimony if I didn't like the current situation. Then he broke down and wept, saying that he might be depressed. I felt horrible for him and offered him my full support, but in retrospect, I'm curious if it was just a convenient excuse to pivot the conversation and get me off his back.

&#x200B;

What would you do in my shoes? I have grown resentful of him and this whole situation.",relationship_advice
My(f 18)dad is going to marry his mistress just 3 months after divorcing my mom and they are expecting me to be exited for them??? And honestly I just hate my father.,"Sorry for rambling but I am just so fucking mad.
I typed this story out maybe 6 or seven times. 

Quick backstory:
I went off to college last year and my mom would appear more and more sad overtime. I asked her and she would always tell me that my brothers (twins m 12) were just a handful.

But one time when I popped in for a surprise visit she was full on crying. I held her for 30 minutes before I could finally pull out the information out of her nose. My dad was having an affair with a  younger womam.

Now don't say my mom shouldn't have said that to me. I asked her. I suspected that and I am happy she did.

I was livid and called my roommate to ask if my mom and brothers could stay for some days.

After much discussion I convinced my mom to leave dad. She was a sahm and was totally financially dependent. But we made do. I moved out from my student apartment and moved on with my mom and part time with my brothers.

It was actually really good for her to change cities and start a new life. But she is still very not okay. She is actually seeing a therapist but it's not easy. 

As you may know my relationship with my father suffered really much. I lost all my respect I had for him.

He tries to invite me to lunch, to the movies and sends me packages with expensive gifts to buy me over.

One time I went over to pick up my brothers and the mistress was there alongside with my dad. She was really a fuckin snake. Would sweet talk and tear my mother down in the process.
I wanted to leave asap and my dad told me they had an announcement.

He was going to get married with her and he asked me to be one of her braidsmaids.
I felt like slapping him and her. Immediately I said no and that I didn't even want to go to their wedding.

Mistress started crying and run out if the room and my father told me he was very disappointed in me. I told him I was disappointed in him too and left.

Cue the next week were I get a bunch of messages. Mistress had created a groupchat for her wedding party.

I ask her to take me out and mistress sends me this :

*Hi Emely.

I know we didn't get to off to a good start cos of all the outside factors. But u need to know that I am not ur enemy. I love ur dad with all my heart and seeing how u have been so cold to him broke both our hearts. U don't have to be my daughter or anything. I just want us to kinda be friends 🤭. See this wedding as a stepping stone to build our relationship! I make ur dad happy and he does make me happy so please just support him!🙏🎉

Love
Xox*

I was dumbfounded. Outside factors??? She means like fucking a married man? I just simply ignored that message and left the group on my own.

My grandma called me and told me she knew this situation was not ideal but that family needs to be there when he gets married.

My mom is not a fan but she says it's up to me. That I can go to the wedding if want to, that she won't be hurt.

I just don't want to go. My dad just send me an invite to go to Disney  with them and called it family bonding time. He allready bought the tickets. 
I love Disney and he knows that but I don't want to see him. I don't forgive him and I hate him. He is 100 percent at fault for hurting my mother and he is just trying to make me love his mistress. I don't see her as my step mom, not even dads fiance she is his fucking mistress.

But they all are making me doubt and making ME feel like the monster for not wanting to be with dad anymore. My aunt had told me that she had seen dad cry at family functions because he had the hope I would turn up and that he always talks about me. And yes it stings . I miss my dad. But I just hate him so much right now.

Am I in the wrong for burning this bridges? What can I do to nit feel so much hate for him? Is it even worth salvaging this relationship?

Edit: thanks you guys for such great support. I will write my dad a letter and not go to the wedding at all. However I wanna go to Disney, wich is why I will pick up some extra hours and treat my mom and myself to a weekend at Disney",relationship_advice
My (22M) girlfriend (22) has transitioned to male and now I feel trapped in the relationship,"  

Before I begin let me just establish this. If I say ""she"" then I'm talking in the past/before and if I say ""he"" I'm referring to the present/now.  I am male, and they shall also be hereby known as X. 

A bit of context. So I met X in high school, we were both 15 when she moved to town and we hit it off immediately becoming good friends. We were quite comfortably platonic till university. We went to different ones in the same city (her for art me for engineering) and in second year none of her mates had space in their flats so she moved in with me and a couple of my mates. It was in this year we got intimate and grew to truly love each other. I am now in my 4th and final year, X is looking for work and we both live alone together. Our relationship has been steady since then. 

Now, X has struggled with depression and anxiety since she was young, and while I can't pretend to know what it's like (my head is mercifully clear) I've always tried to be supportive. Whenever she was suffering badly in her first year at Uni I would come over to be with her. We'd eat a pizza, play mario kart and I'd act like everything was normal and alright. She said it helped and I was really glad about that.

But here's the thing. About 2 months ago she had a really rough spot, worse than she had had in the past and eventually one evening told me that she didn't feel right as a woman and needs to start presenting as a man. She had been so down over the last week because she didn't want to tell me for fear she would lose me. I'll be honest I didn't really know how to take that one and after an agonising silence I hugged her, said I was there for her and would be supportive. I reasoned that this was a person I loved, so that shouldn't change. Plus I figured from all I had ever heard about transitioning this was going to be hard and I didn't want to make it worse by being un-receptive. From there it was an evening with a lot of crying and a lot of talking but all seemed like it would be alright.

So over the few days *he* seems to feel significantly better. A couple of days later he made a post about it on facebook and got almost nothing but support. His parents are fairly progressive and, I mean, his art school buddies seemed overjoyed. He blocked anyone who left laughing emotes or snide comments, but there were very few of those. I got a few comedy messages from mates but overall it seemed to be accepted by his social circle. Later that week he got a haircut, and I took him to get some new clothes. He also started deepening his voice a bit, though it took him a while to settle on one.  He continues to have a fair amount of struggles with it in day to day live, not everyone in the world is receptive and he is still getting a lot of mis-gendering but it has been going better than I was expecting. The whole experience has given me a deeper compassion for the hardships that come with being trans. 

However, here is the thing. I'm pencil straight. I have gay family members, I grew up thinking it was normal, I even had a night in my wild first Uni year where I got with a guy who was hitting on me but it ain't for me. Over the last 2 months as he has continued his transition and has even started looking into surgery I have felt the spark of sexual attraction fade. It has become a running joke with most people I know that ""X turned \_\_\_ gay"" and I hate to admit it but it has started really getting to me. It doesn't help that he doesn't want anything done in the front due to it not aligning with his gender and I don't like anal (giving, and there's no value for either of us in me taking). I still like him, we still have a good rapport and I do want to be supportive, but I see no future in this relationship any more. My problem is I'm scared of what will happen if I try to break up. So much of his fear about coming out with this was about losing me and what will people think of me when the story is inevitably paraphrased to ""he broke up with him because he was trans"". Both our names are on the lease, but neither one of us could pay for the place alone. Hell, I asked my parents what they thought and they said I should try to be a little more open minded and stick it out, it could just be a rough patch and that I'm struggling to adapt. But it's not, I admit it's on me but I can't see my feelings changing. I have talked to a few of my close mates and they basically just say ""glad I'm not you"" jokingly and try to move the conversation on. I just don't know what to do now and I'm feeling trapped in this relationship. What the hell do I do, how do I approach this with him and how do I end the relationship without hurting him and ostracising myself",relationship_advice
Accidentally peed on my boss's dick,"I know this sounds ridiculous and probably sounds like I'm trolling, but unfortunately I'm not. I'm humiliated and don't want to go to work anymore and I don't think my boss wants me back either. 

So, last night we were out at a company Christmas party. My Male coworkers and I have stupid ways of bonding including drinking competitions, paper basketball, and downloading suspicious apps on each other's phones. Basically, we act like we're children. We're in a 9-5 office job so we take any opportunity we can get to make things less boring. No one gets hurt and everyone has fun. UNTIL LAST NIGHT. 

We are all at a bar and pretty drunk and I went to take a slosh. My boss and my friend, Dave, came in after me while I was about to pee. We decided to see how far away we could stand from the urinal and still get everything in. Dave finished peeing and my boss was pretty far back so Dave pointed my boss out. I automatically turned and, since I'm a little taller than my boss, accidentally sprayed him with some of my golden nectar. On his dick. 

His response was ""what the fuck man?"" I think he thought I did it on purpose. I apologised and left really quickly and haven't seen him since. I'm not sure what to do now. I don't want to go back to work. Should I confront him about it or pretend it never happened? 

Advice please ...

UPDATE: My [27f] friend [32] is cheating on his long time girlfriend of 4 years with TONS of girls. Should I tell her?,"[previous thread, although the description was deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a3feh2/my_27f_friend_32_is_cheating_on_his_long_time/)

Original thread tl;dr
My pro-athlete friend was constantly cheating on his girlfriend of four years (now 5 years) with multiple different women and I was conflicted on whether or not to say something to her. The majority of our friends knew about the cheating going on but no one had said anything.





After I posted that question and read all the replies, I decided to tell the girlfriend. I didn't really know how to go about it, because I don't really know her that well. So, I did the cowardly thing and made a fake Instagram account to send her a message on. At first I wanted to keep it anonymous, give her some proof I had which were screenshots of my friend bragging to me on Snapchat and various other platforms about how many girls he had slept with that week/night. His fake Tinder profile too. He would catfish girls on there and add them on Snapchat to talk to them, sending them his Instagram account so they can see that he's 'famous' and make the girls ""feel privileged"" that he's talking to them. ((his words not mine)). I figured I could start by not saying my name, and I would gauge her reaction then I would let her log onto my social media accounts and see for herself what her boyfriend had said to me just to verify what I had been saying was true. The conversations with my friend over Snapchat were always saved, so that wasn't an issue about having lost messages.





[So, this is the message I opened up with](https://imgur.com/je9v7lE)
When I told her that other people knew, I specifically meant her boyfriends pro-biker friends who travel with him all over the world. They all know he cheats on her because they're there when it all happens. I didn't say that at first to her, but then she sent [this](https://imgur.com/afWJ64L)



After she asked me for someone else's name, I felt really bad just giving her it, so I messaged my friend quickly and asked him if it was alright to pass his name along and he said yeah. After a little bit of back and forth between the girlfriend and myself, I offered her my log in details to some of my accounts so she can see what her boyfriend has been saying to me. I apologized to her for bringing this all up. 
[She replied with this](https://imgur.com/ioEXZxg). I gave her my details, and then she knew exactly who I was. 




A lot more messages were sent to each other, and surprisingly she seemed to be taking it well. Now by this time though, she had messaged my friend saying that ""some girl"" had messaged her telling he had cheated and that he needs to admit it. She was telling me that she hasn't mentioned my name at all to him, and she sent me screenshots of their conversation. He messaged her saying ""it was Becky who messaged you wasn't it?"". My name is not Becky. The girlfriend said no it is not Becky, and asked who Becky was. He said he slept with Becky ONCE. I told her this is a lie as it happened more than once, and that he will have millions of other names to give her, so don't just settle for the one name. 



After some more messaging, and giving her more details about things he's said and done in the past [she sent me this](https://imgur.com/KHuBXFf)

And this is what I said back to her, with her reply saying that he finally admitted it. [Here](https://imgur.com/iVmBDdk)




I felt extremely guilty for causing this drama and telling her about her boyfriend, I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about how I broke two people up. I can only imagine how bad she feels! My friend hasn't messaged me at all, and the girlfriend hasn't messaged me since either. I don't know if they broke up for sure 100%, but at least now she knows the truth about who she's dating. And if she wants to either end things with him completely or try work things out between them then I hope whatever she chooses it brings her peace. 




I think I have lost a friendship out of this, but I've come to realise that if someone is willing to cheat and lie to the one you love then you're probably a piece of shit anyway. 




TL;DR 
Messaged the girlfriend about her boyfriend cheating, gave her all my log in details to my accounts so she can read what her boyfriend has bragged about to me. He finally admitted it all. She broke up with him. Not friends with the guy anymore.


EDIT: Thankyou guys for your kind messages and reassuring me that I did the right thing. You guys are awesome! And thanks for the silver :) ",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [36M] fiancé [38F] wanted separate finances...,"Link to the previous thread:

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cimtl4/my_36m_fianc%C3%A9_38f_wanted_split_finances_now_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So a lot has happened in a short span of time. Frankly my head is spinning. I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive recap.

I got home the day I posted the last thread and I was prepared to confront her. Unfortunately she and the kids weren't home when we arrived. My brother and I started talking and they returned while we were on the phone. I left the house to finish the call and she called 15 times while I was outside. I ignored her calls. 

I got back inside and the fireworks began. We got into a verbally heated argument but I refused to back down. She was adamant that I was disrespecting her by asking her to contribute to the house and that I wasn't a real man. She maintained her innocence throughout and continued trying to gaslight me. I wasn't having any of it and I think she realized she had lost her grip over me. 

She left the room, effectively ending the discussion. She slept in her daughters room. Around 11 am the next day she emerged from her daughters room, got her bathing suit and some beach items and took her kids out again without inviting my daughter, who cried as they left, begging to join them. 

This is where things got wild.  She and her kids never returned that day (Sunday). I assume they slept at the friends house who invited them over. I went to work Monday morning and dropped my daughter at camp per usual. I picked her up after work and we returned to the house. Literally all of their belongings were gone. She took about half the furniture in the house.  And a ton of things that were mine she has since refused to return. I was floored...

There was no communication, no indication that she was leaving, nothing. I texted her and she said she wanted time and space to think about things and that I needed to respect that. She said she needed to consider if she could be with someone who didn't want to fully support her and her kids...

I asked her for my $30k engagement ring back and she claimed she threw it in a lake!  I don't believe it for a second.  She likely pawned it or intends to shortly. After consulting my lawyer and family I called the police to report what happened and file a report for my missing belongings. 

The police have informed me that because she lived here for over a year and her license uses this address that the household belongings are as much hers as they are mine. My attorney disagrees and we are filing a civil suit to sue her.  The ring is a separate matter. As I understand it, that's a conditional gift in Texas and if we don't marry it must be returned assuming I can prove her to be at fault for the end of the relationship. Even if I don't win it will be a small victory forcing her to retain counsel and spend some money. 

Obviously the relationship is over. Not sure if she realizes that but I have listed the house since it's way too big for me and found a new place in the city. We move next Friday.  I plan to live there while I get in therapy and fix my head. I don't think this girl ever loved me. I was just a bank account and the minute I cut off access to my funds she literally LEFT. I've never felt so worthless and unloved.  I'm not sure how to recover.  Or trust another woman frankly. I thought she was my soulmate. I love her and am still in love with her. That's how fucked my head is right now.  I just hope it heals with time. 

Love sucks.",relationship_advice
I [48 M] don't know how to be a good dad to a child [1 M] I never wanted.,"So my wife (she's 40 and we've been married for 18 years) and I were vehemently childfree, or so I thought. We've always planned that if an accident did happen and she were to get pregnant she'd have an abortion.

We've talked in the past about a vasectomy, clearly it never happened. We both have a low libido. Sex maybe once a month. She had an IUD. Often we'd still use condoms since it was more cleanly. 

Well against all odds my son was created. I pushed for an abortion which she wanted originally. That never came to fruition since she began to have doubts it was the right thing to do. Eventually she said she just couldn't go through with it. I don't blame her nor do I feel negatively towards her suddenly wanting to be a mother. Afterall is the most natural thing there is, especially once pregnant. I could not fault her. I love her dearly. She knows what she is and isn't capable of and she wasn't capable of abortion.

She has acclimated wonderfully to motherhood, whereas I to fatherhood? Not so much. I was planning on retiring in a few years. We were going to travel since we haven't ever done much of it. I've always been fairly busy. I was ready to be done. I've worked hard to put us in a position where this was possible.

Now with a child it's really not feasible. That's not the point really. The point is this niggling sense of resentment. The fact that I'll have a teenager in my 60s fills me with dread. The fact that when I look at my son I don't feel love, just an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

I feel horrid saying that, but this isn't the life I wanted nor dreamt of or worked hard for. I don't hate him for it. It is what it is. I'm struggling, however. Mentally mostly, I'd say. Emotionally I'm a wreck. I think I hide it well.

It's just never ending. He goes goes goes. And screams. He's never satisfied. He's cute when he laughs. He's a spitting image of me. I feel a pull towards him. I wouldn't miss him if he disappeared. I want him to be happy. I'm not happy. How will this ever work?

I'm afraid of failing him and creating some sort of monster. I'm afraid I'll never be enough. I'm afraid I'll never feel content in my own home ever again.  I'd run if I were a lesser man. I'd never leave them without means to care for themselves... but I'd run.

I will never run. He needs more than just money. I don't know how to be more than just a wallet. How do I love him? How do I be everything he needs? How do I not lose myself in the process?

 I Hope I'm not an incoherent babbling mess.

"My brother (15M) has been lying about my (25M) life to my conservative, estranged parents, MADE FAKE INSTAGRAM, HELP","Ok I'll try to make this quick but there's a lot and I'm freaking the fuck out.

I grew up a Jehovah's Witness. If you don't know, JW are extremely conservative to an insane degree--I wasn't allowed to read Harry Potter, if that makes sense. And my parents were not lax or exceptions-for-my-children type. Extremely devout people. And I'm gay.

When I was sixteen I was outted horribly by my sister who found some gay porn that I didn't delete from my computer history. My family, of course, flipped out and demanded I either seek conversion therapy or get out. Luckily for me, my aunt had also defected from the church, so I was able to move in with her (FAR away).

My parents and sister immediately wanted nothing to do with me. But my brother was six. He was too young to really grasp what was going on, and had no phone or social media or anything, so I couldn't contact him. I honestly just assumed he drank the same end-is-nigh Kool-Aid and never sought him out.

Earlier this year, I got a message from him on Facebook. It was a gigantic apology for not saying goodbye properly, and that he really wanted me back in his life. Clicking through his profile, I didn't see any JW proselytizing like my sister's--just pics of him and his friends being normal teens. I was beyond happy. I messaged him back, we FaceTimed, cried, he caught me up a little in his life and I caught him up a little in mine. And from there we started texting regularly. I am very, very happy about all this. But he was still living under my parents' roof, and was still heavy in JW culture. I was nervous about this. He always reaffirmed that he only called/texted when he wasn't in the house (or around other JW), and reaffirmed that he thought the church was awful.

Last week something weird happened. I got an e-mail from my mother. It was a picture from a recent Dells trip she had taken with my family and another JW family. Years of no contact, then this. What the fuck? I spent DAYS talking this out with my friends before it occurred to me that my brother might have something to do with this.

I brought up the e-mail to my brother when I called him yesterday, barely hinting at my suspicions at all, and he unloaded. He had been lying to my parents. He said that *I* contacted *him* apologizing and was desperate to get back in contact with the Witnesses again, but was too ashamed. But the kicker is he made a FAKE INSTAGRAM to show them. He plucked all the G-rated pictures from my various social medias and filled it in with captions about how devout I am, how happy I am to have refound God's light, etc. He had taken pictures of me and my best friend, Julie, and added captions like ""the love of my life"", ""my bride-to-be"" etc. like HOLY shit. He seemed already remorseful of this ploy but that he was in too deep to stop now.

Now, he didn't say as much, but the obvious implication here is that he thought he could get my family back together. But this isn't a fucking sitcom or *The Birdcage*, he's catfishing his very emotionally unstable and religious zealot parents into thinking their faggot outcast son was reconverting. I have NO intentions of being in their life ever again, but I'd like to remain in my brother's life, and I don't want this incident to scare him off or sever the small bits of contact we have now.

So what do I do? I will not be contacting my parents, nor will I pretend to be straight. Obviously I need to tell him to close the account and stop talking about me to them, but what else if anything?

**TL;DR: I'm gay, religious parents kicked me out, little brother made a fake Insta to convince them that I'm not gay anymore. I do not know how to stop this.**",relationship_advice
The last time I (65M) went on a date was 1978. Guidance on 2019 dating etiquette?,"Throwaway account because I am not yet ready to share with my adult children.

When my wife developed a degenerative neurological disease I was her caregiver until she also developed dementia at which point I could no longer give her the care she needed at home. She lived In a memory care facility until she finally passed away. I've lived completely alone for the last 2 years.

I met and had lunch with a nice lady last week. We will see each other again.

My dating etiquette is 41 years old. I always used to open the car door for my wife. But she had asked me to stop a while back. I don't really know if it's because that's not a thing anymore or if me opening her door made her feel a little less independent.

In the old days I always paid for meals and events and I've been fortunate in my career so I really am happy to pick up all the checks.

If you are reading this, I'm probably asking you about dating etiquette expectations for people your mother's or grandmother's ages.

I would be grateful for any guidance and advice.

I think my brother ejaculated on me while I was asleep,"We've had to share a bedroom for about 5 weeks now thanks to construction work in my family's house, but I've never noticed anything else like this during all that time, or before it.

I nap most days, either straight after school or around 7-8pm. But on Wednesday my school finishes early, so I usually nap at like 3pm when its just me and sometimes my brother at home.

That's how it was last Wednesday, and I woke up probably at like 4:30pm or so, and touched my leg when I was getting up and noticed it was wet. Then I noticed a lot more of the same wetness on my side/stomach and on my top. It was only slightly thicker than water I think, and sort of sticky to touch and it definitely smelled of semen. But it wasn't white, it was clear.

I haven't spoken to him or anyone else about it yet. I have no idea what I'd even say really. I can't be totally sure it even was semen, but I can't think what other liquids smell like that. And he hasn't been acting any differently at all.

I was disgusted and confused. My boyfriend actually seemed really taken aback by it, and he started laughing in hysterics when I asked him if he was gay. 

He says it's just a ""harmless game"" they all do and that it ""isn't sexual between them"" and that it's ""all about that distance."" 

I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with him acting in a sexual way with anyone outside our relationship, but he got really annoyed with me and kept insisting it was just a game. 

He even said I could ""be a spectator"" when they do it tomorrow night, and that girlfriends of the other roommates had been ""in the audience"" before. 

I was so mortified and astounded by this that I had to leave. He keeps texting me saying he is amazed by my ""hilarious reaction"" and that I need to ""chill"".

My boyfriend had sex with me in my sleep and now that I'm awake i feel very sick to my stomach. Advice?,"Hi this is probably going to be my first and only post on this app. But yeah basically what my title says. Last night i went to sleep after smoking a joint (i smoke marijuana daily so it wasn't me ""tripping out"") while my boyfriend stayed up playing 2K. Next thing i know, i wake up a little to my shorts off and my boyfriend sticking his penis in me. I don't know why i didn't fully wake up, i was too sleepy that i just let my body lay there. i don't even know what time it was. I don't even remember the whole thing. After waking up to him on top of me, the next thing i remember is not even moaning and feeling him struggle to put it back in me due to my vagina muscles being too tight and i finally was able to get myself to close my legs and make him off. 

Fast forward to hours later. It's currently 5:35 a.m. and I'm fully awake. I woke up feeling so gross and dirty to where i felt nauseous and then i quickly remember what i had just explained to y'all and i instantly felt like i wanted to cry. I felt like I've gotten taken advantage of but Is that even possible? He's my boyfriend...am i just being dramatic? I'm currently sitting in the tub. I wanted to wash myself but like (TMI) i don't even wanna touch myself down there to wash. I just feel dirty, ashamed, nauseous, and overall confused. 

Update: i had failed to mention that he had gotten high with me too before i went to bed. Its possible he was still high when he was having sex with me...maybe he wasn't in his right mind? Or is this me trying to make up an excuse for him?",relationship_advice
My fiancé ended our relationship today because I liked my sons Facebook post (of him and his dad fishing). He said it was disrespectful to him and gave me an ultimatum to never like anything he posts that includes his father or it was over. I did not agree to that and he ended it. Am I wrong?,"I am divorced, and my children are adults, out of school. He is divorced and his children are 6 (twins) and his son from his first marriage just graduated high school. 

I've never met either ex but the story is the same, they are crazy and lazy. 

He doesn't have a relationship with his son and sees his twins once a month. 

He is eight years older than me. 

My relationship with my kids father is not the same. 
We coparent and have healthy boundaries. We do not fight. 

My fiancé has given me ultimatums in the past about my kids and then recanted them. It feels almost like he's jealous of them in a way.   He has the same issues with my sisters. 

He has asked me to make a lot of changes. I've moved farther from my kids for him, I have a successful career that he has once convinced me to give up, but I had to start working again after three months away from what I enjoy. I've made every change he has asked except cut off my kids. They don't ask me for money ever. They go to college. They are good kids. Not in trouble. We literally are together maybe once every month or two. 

As I said, I was off for three months and got an offer for a VP job back in Texas where I am from, we talked it over and I took it because his company is going through a sale process and we got an apartment here because he wants to move here when it's finished and closed in August. He currently comes down from NY every weekend.  He obviously cancelled plans for this weekend. 

My fiancé has done a lot of things for me. He has given me nice gifts and helped me through things but, something in my gut tonight said this is not right. So I refused to agree to the ultimatum.  I have never had to depend on him financially but he wants me too. It feels like he doesn't want me to have any kind of relationship outside of ours. 

Am I wrong in my decision to stand firm. His ultimatum felt irrational and controlling. 

I know he will call tomorrow.  I just need a perspective on how someone else would handle this.

Why would a man leave his wife and child to pursue a relationship with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend?,"My brother in law was very sick and died about a month and a half ago. My husband came out to see him before he died, and I (and our infant daughter) flew out to support my husband the day of his death. The first couple of days were good. I took care of the baby and tried to be supportive of him and his family. On the day of the memorial service, we got into a stupid argument, and he banned me from attending the service. Afterwards, he got very drunk and ended up in the hospital (possible suicidal ideation and blackout). Angry over the situation, his family kicked me out, and my baby and I had to stay in a hotel, alone, until my flight back. While I was home and figuring out how to reconcile with my husband, he was becoming romantically involved with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend, the same woman who was flirting with him because he ""looks like his brother"" and had told his brother on his deathbed that she loved him. When my husband returned home a few days later, he announced he wanted a divorce and immediately proceeded on the process. That week I discovered he was indicating that he loves this woman, he is seeking a long distance romantic relationship with her right now, and is considering moving back to be with her and his parents. 

This whole thing is INSANE, and I still can't wrap my head around it all. Why would someone do this? What do you think will happen? And what should I do?",relationship_advice
My girlfriend's [23F] ex boyfriend was black. I [24M] don't have a problem with it but she keeps bringing it up,"We've been together a year. We're both white. She had been broken up with her ex-boyfriend for about a month when we met. I didn't know he was black until after we got together. She mentioned it casually like, ""Hey, I just want you to know my ex, Z, was black."" Me: Okay. Cool.

I thought that was the end of it, but no. She brings it up constantly and randomly. Whenever we see a black guy, whether on TV or real life, she'll bring it up and compare him to the guy. Apparently, her ex looks like Idris Elba but lighter skinned and built like the Rock. He also raps better than Kanye. One time she told me that she thought she was pregnant by him and that the baby would have been black. Okay, yeah, so what? I swear anytime anyone says the word ""black"" and it doesn't even have to be referring to the people, she'll chime in ""My ex was black!"" 

Honestly, it makes me think she is racist. Or she thinks I am secretly racist which I'm not. I have no problem with black people or black guys dating white women. How do I deal with this?",relationship_advice
My (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but I feel uncomfortable,"I guess this is half relationship advice and half ""am I the asshole"". 

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months and having sex pretty regularly for the duration. Now (seemingly to me) randomly she brings out a massive toy (we're talking like massive, like inhuman levels) and asks me to use it on her during sex. Now I don't want her to feel bad about what she's into, but I'm not using that thing on her. It makes me physically uncomfortable, I lost the mood the moment I saw it. 

She doesn't seem to understand that to me this feels like she's calling me inadequate, and even if I know that's not what she meant I still feel that way. I'm not trying to control what she does by herself, but when I'm involved I don't want that toy to be. 

To be clear, this isn't the first time we've brought toys into the bedroom. Pretty regularly I use a small vibrator on her and we've experimented with other (more regularly sized) vibrating dildos.

Is there any way I can get her to understand what I'm feeling? Am I the asshole for not doing it?

UPDATE:
 
So I woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. I called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that I tell her why I was so panicked. Reluctantly I showed her my post. 

We've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. I think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

First of all, what I picked up from her. I didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although I had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so I found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. I also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

What she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

What we both learned about me is that I have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. From this to the fact that I go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because I was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). That's something that I need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though I feel uncomfortable. 

So now the all important part where I tell you the decision we came to. We decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when I feel like I've worked through the root issue enough. 

TL;DR we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when I've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: Should I (23F) tell my boyfriend (26M) about the egg?,"Hey guys! 3 months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bflbwz/should_i_23f_tell_my_boyfriend_26m_about_the_egg/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The TLDR of it is my SO and I hid Easter eggs for each other, and the day before I spotted the giant egg. It was the night before Easter, and I wanted to make a light hearted post inquiring about whether or not I should tell him I spotted it. Well, it blew up. Some weren't happy that it wasn't an unhappy post, but many wanted an update. 

Easter wasn't a proposal... But he proposed late last night!! I got home from a long 8 hour drive. He sat me on the couch and wanted to show me a music video he ""helped a friend make"". It was silly, but it was his cover of ""when words fail"" from *the Shrek musical*. It's his favorite musical of all time, and when the relationship was first getting started, I learned one of the duets to surprise him with. It's very cute that he picked the musical, because the song does fit, he's funny, and we're immature together like that. As the video ended, he suddenly got up and sang the rest to me and pulled the ring out of his pocket. 

He made [the ring](http://imgur.com/a/2M5l1Gx) himself with a fire opal, and while it isn't from some fancy big name store, I told him from the very beginning that I don't care how much he spends or doesn't spend. He's not a master jeweler, it was his first (and probably only) ring he will ever make, but it's perfect in every way to me. It symbolizes our love, because he worked so hard on it and it's so very *him*. I love the ring. I love him. I'm nervous to get married because I'm awkward when I'm the center of attention, but I can't wait to be his wife. 

So of course, I accepted! He caught the entire thing on video, but I haven't decided if I want to doxx myself by sharing it here.  I'm also not sure if the mods will allow that? 

So, there it is! The final update! Thank you all for the love and positivity 3 months ago, I hope we can keep all that kindness going for everyone here in the sub!",relationship_advice
I [26M] Killed My Girlfriend's [25F] Parents Dog In Self Defense And We're On The Verge Of Breaking Up,"This was locked by the overzealous mods on the other subreddit and I'm told this place is more reasonable.

My girlfriend's parents, who I'll call Jane and John, have a notoriously vicious doberman, who I'll call Satan, they refuse to train. It killed a cat in their neighborhood a few years back and has aggressively gone after visitors and neighbors when it gets off the leash. I've refused to go over to their house since meeting her for this reason, and as a result any visits we've had her parents came to us.

My girlfriend had a falling out with her closest friend recently and it's been a rough few weeks on her. Her parents asked her (and me, they always extend an invite despite me never going) over for dinner and family time to cheer her up. I agreed to go as I figured it might make her happy to actually have me attend, but I told her I would only go if Satan was kept in the basement (finished basement with a door) while I was there. She agreed, and we both spoke to her parents on the phone and they agreed.

We showed up and I had her go in to ensure Satan was in the basement, which it was. Everything was going great, John gave me a little tour and showed me their backyard and some bags of sand he needed moved, and the four of us started to cook dinner together. Jane realized she was missing vegetables and asked if my girlfriend would run to the store with her, so they left. John asked me if I'd help him move the sand since neither of us are great cooks, and led me to the backyard, leaving the sliding door open.

About 5 minutes in I hear John yelling to ""watch out"" from inside the house. Satan comes barreling out the patio door, down the steps and immediately lunges for me. I start trying to back up calmly while telling Satan to fuck off, and he keeps making lunges for me. John (mid 60's with mobility issues) comes out of the house and helpfully decides to start screaming at the dog which only makes things worse. I kick at Satan when he lunges for me, and he grabs my leg. I'm on the ground while John comes over and tries to pull Satan by the collar and I try to push my finger into its eye and hit it in the snout and end up getting bitten badly and held by my left arm. At this point I yell at John to move back and use my pocket knife (again, rural area, not abnormal to carry) to free myself.

John is apologizing profusely, and said Satan was whining in the basement so he went down to comfort him and he slipped out. He offers an ambulance which I decline, so we put polysporin on my arm and leg and we get ready to leave in his car to the hospital. My girlfriend and Jane get home and start panicking and I tell them what happened as I get into John's car. Both of them immediately rush to the backyard, my girlfriend not even asking if I'm ok, to tend to the dog.

John waited with me until I was evaluated and released and Jane came in the meantime to tell us Satan died at the shelter and to apologize. I asked why my girlfriend wasn't there and Jane said I'd have to talk to her myself. When I got home, I asked her where she was. She told me with Satan, and asked me ""how I could kill a dog."" No question about how I am, no comfort for what I had to do, nothing. I tell her I'm sorry, that I tried to back away, tried kicking it but it bit me. She keeps asking ""why"" I had to kill it, why I couldn't have tried other things, then accused me of killing it right away ""because I was always afraid of it."" This eventually made me blow up, tell her that her parents cared more about my well-being than she does and that I wasn't going to let myself get mauled to protect a fucking dog. She left and we haven't spoken since sunday, she's at her parents house and John called to check on me and told me they're talking to her.

So here we are. Neither of us willing to budge. She believes I should have done more to get Satan off me non-lethally and seems to think I killed it because I wanted to. I believe I did my best, had very little time or opportunity to react to a dog that had severely aggressive tendencies for years and while I didn't want to kill it I'd rather it die than leave me disfigured. I've grown up in a small town around free roaming dogs my whole life, I know when they just want to scare you and when they plan to rip you to shreds and this dog had murderous intent. I don't know how to communicate with her or make her see my side, and I feel betrayed and hurt she isn't even attempting to view this from my point of view. I understand she's going through a lot, but I feel like she's taking it out on me. How do we fix this?

TL;DR Girlfriend's parents vicious dog attacked me, I killed it to protect myself. Girlfriend seems completely indifferent to my experience and blames me for my actions, left home and refuses to speak to me. I feel hurt and betrayed. What do we do?",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] People are constantly pointing out the disparity in attractiveness between me (28F) and my boyfriend (29M). How should I respond to this?,"Original post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blfh9u/people_are_constantly_pointing_out_the_disparity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Thanks everyone for some super helpful suggestions for a range of different scenarios. Not so much thanks to the many people who inboxed me asking for photos... 

My boyfriend and I went abroad to a wedding this past weekend, a family friend of his, so with a lot of his family and friends. I was a little worried about it because it seemed like a prime time for people to be commenting on our relationship. Well, I wasn't wrong. Most comments were pretty well intentioned (from his friends and family), but I actually find these almost harder to respond to than the blatantly rude ones because it's hard to strike a balance between polite but still letting them know it's inappropriate. I went with what a lot of people suggested and just turned it back around (when someone said 'how'd you snag this one?' I jumped in with 'I was just lucky, I guess'). As people were drinking there was one or two slightly more rude comments. One guy said (jokingly, but still) 'damn, what're you doing with this guy!' so I pulled my bf into me and said gave a sly wink and said 'oooo, that's between me and him' which everyone laughed at. 

Anyway, we ended up having a big discussion about it. He said he's getting used to it and trying not to let it really bother him so much, and that I shouldn't be offended or upset on his behalf. Pretty sure this is the man I want to marry so we're just going to have to find a way to get overcome it. Was good to hear in some of your comments that it just becomes a non-issue after a while. 

Thanks again!",relationship_advice
Girlfriend doesn't want to sign a prenup,"To make a long story short, I love my girlfriend but she is financially illiterate and doesn't save a dime.

We both come from very poor families, but I have always saved every penny, started investing when I was 14, and now actively trade as well. My portfolio is just south of 3.6M at 26 years old. My girlfriend earns as much as me at her job, but unlike me she spends her entire paycheque on dinners/clothes/shoes/concerts etc. She earns enough to be saving plenty but wastes it all on luxuries. Her entire savings is like $100 and hasn't paid anything off her student loan.

Now I don't have a problem with how my girlfriend spends her money, the problem is she wants it to be our money. She wants to get married, but doesn't want to sign a prenup. I want a prenup which clearly protects not just my current investments, but also future investments + investment growth. We would split all bills otherwise and also pay any mortgage equally. So our finances would be separate except for mortgages/expenses etc which we would split.

The reason for this is that I know my would-be wife would save very little and if we ever got divorced, I'd end up giving away a good chunk of my savings with nothing in return. It would be extremely one sided.

I know I sound like a greedy prick here, but I'm just trying to be blunt and I'm not as asshole sounding in person.

Anyway, how do I talk to her about this? I am honestly not willing to get married without such a prenup. She said she's hurt I'd consider a prenup and that I'm not considering her feelings, but I also feel the same way. She isn't seeing it from my point of view.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bh4qad/my\_17f\_stepdad\_51m\_has\_been\_sleeping\_with\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/)

So I realize that in making this update I'm going to skipping over a lot of what happened in the past week because it's too much for me to type out and I doubt anyone would be willing to read all of that, so I'm just going to lay out what I know now about what happened and if people have questions I can try to answer some. At this point my sister and mom are the ones who need advice and support more than I do but they keep telling me I shouldn't be as involved as I'm trying to be. I'm mainly making this post because there were some genuinely concerned people in the comments (which I really appreciate) who asked for updates, and I also just wanted to give a big fuck you to all the people who brushed this all off as my sister just being a slut with daddy issues. 

I also want to clarify something that is extremely important that a ton of people seemed to miss in the original post: Shaun is NOT my sisters biological dad. My sister's dad is someone my mom was with once casually and I don't know much about him, but I think my sister keeps in contact with him a little bit now. My sister and I have different dads. My dad passed away and Shaun is not related to either of us. 

Also if one more person feels inclined to make a joke about this sounding like a porn plot you can fuck right off. You aren't funny and it's really sickening for someone experiencing this to read, ESPECIALLY the ones saying that he's coming for me next. What's wrong with you..

Anyway. So the reason all of this came to the surface is because my mom was in the kitchen cleaning up that night, and she grabbed his phone to look something up because she didn't have hers on her and the last thing he had open was his photos/videos. She said she saw that he had a folder of ""inappropriate sexual videos"" of my sister on his phone and she was sure that he was the one who took them because they were in our basement. 

Before she talked to my sister all she knew was that my stepdad had these videos and that it was obvious my sister was aware that she was being filmed, it wasn't like he hid a camera somewhere. When she confronted my stepdad she said he stumbled over his words a lot and it took him awhile to give an explanation, but when he did it was obvious that he was lying. 

I made an update about this in the comments a few days after the original post but I know a lot of people missed it: All my mom told me the first time I saw her after this whole thing blew up was that the situation was complicated and she didn't seem upset with my sister. I had also overheard my aunt say something like ""this is what happens when you agree to have an open relationship"" and my mom got really angry. She ended up telling me about this a couple days later, but apparently she and Shaun have had an open relationship because my mom has endometriosis and I guess she can't or doesn't want to ""be as intimate"" as Shaun does, so she told him he could see other people as long as she didn't become aware of it, he didn't develop feelings for someone else, and it didn't hurt our family life at all. 

My sister ended up coming to stay with us at my aunt's house last Monday, which is when she ended up telling my mom and I what happened. It took her awhile to get the words out because she was crying so badly and it seemed like she didn't know whether or not to say it, but basically: 

Shaun offered to help my sister pay off her student debt if she let him film these videos. She ended up dropping out of school because her anxiety and depression were getting really bad, but she had been in and out of school for the past couple years and had taken out a lot of loans but didn't get her degree so the jobs she has aren't enough to pay them off. One of the only things she talks about is how stressed she is about money and paying off her debt. Apparently Shaun offered to help pay some of it off himself but said she needed to do her part too, and he told her that he knew how she could make money by selling/posting the videos. He would handle all of that for her, he just needed her to trust that he knew what she needed to do in them. 

I don't know the extent of what she did in them/what he did to her, but at one point she said he had first told her he wouldn't touch her, but after the first few times he started to get physical and threatened to stop helping her with her payments if she didn't. My mom cut her off at this point and said she didn't need to say any more about it, gave her a hug, and they both cried for awhile.

I've talked to my sister privately a few times and she said from what she can tell Shaun has taken all of the videos down. I guess at some point when we were at my aunt's he came back and got some of his stuff, and my mom has since changed the locks so he can't come back in and we're not sure where he is. My mom said my aunt had been in contact with him the day or two after this all blew up and she told him to stay away from us and to get his things and leave, but hasn't heard from him since. We're living at home again until my mom figures out different living arrangements for us, my sister is sharing a room with me, and my mom sleeps in the guest room.

My sister told me our mom is trying to take legal action against him but my sis doesn't want her to because she feels like doing so will make this public and she just wants it to go away. My mom has also tried to get my sister to see a therapist, but my sister keeps saying she's fine and would rather put that money towards her loans. For the past few days everything that's been said about it is just between my mom and my sister, so I don't know if anything's changed, but it seems like they're trying to just not talk about it and focus on finding somewhere we can afford to live that's near my school and my mom's work. 

So I guess the only advice I can ask for is: is there anything I can do to help my family right now? And does this seem like something they should/can be taking legal action about?",relationship_advice
"I (21M) got my FWB (33F) pregnant and she's keeping it, I want to talk to her about other options.","This has been really weighing on me for the past couple of days, I'll try to sum it up the best I can.

I'm a 21 year old dude in college. About 8 months ago I met my current FWB at a bar. We had a lot of chemistry and we immediately hit it off, and things escalated from there. 

We've been in this exclusive FWB relationship for half a year already. She's amazing and I really like her a lot. She's gorgeous and incredibly intelligent, I can actually have a good conversation with her. She's 33 and has a very solid job, basically she has her life in order. We see each other roughly 2/3 times a week and it feels like every time it gets better. We're not just there for the benefits, we really enjoy each other's company. We never really dated but that's also partly because of the age gap.

Sunday she told me that she's pregnant. With my kid. She's on the pill but got knocked up anyway. She's 7 weeks in already and told me immediately when she found it. She also told me that she's 100% sure she wants to keep it. She says that she's ready to be mom and that it feels like the right time. If I don't want to be involved with the kid she wouldn't mind and she says that she's capable of raising him/her by herself, if I were to choose to not be involved. This news came as a complete shock for me, and I had no clue she would keep baby if she got pregnant. She told me in the past she would probably terminate it if she ever were to get pregnant. It's all so confusing to me.

I'm 21. I don't want a kid right now. But she's going to put one on the world that's ours. I also don't want the kid to grow up without the father, even if she says she can handle it on her own (which I know she could). She wouldn't seek child support from me either, she makes way more than me. I understand that she's carrying a child and that it's not my place to tell her what to do. I do want to ask her if she has considered abortion and if that's still an option. I don't know if I can do this and if I'm ready to be a father. Would it be a dick move to ask/tell her what she thinks of abortion?

I'm not saying she SHOULD get an abortion or that I think that's the only option. I want her to at least consider it and see it from my side. It's her choice, but I feel like she only focussed on keeping the kid. Rightfully so of course, nothing wrong with that. Do I just need to live with it? I feel lost.",relationship_advice
"I kicked my best friends boyfriend out of my car before a vacation, making them miss our flight. Now she's not talking to me.","Sorry for any formatting problems i'm on mobile, TLDR at bottom because this is long.

My best friend and I are going on 15 years of friendship, and we (along with our friend group) planned a vacation. The day of comes and since I have the largest car I volunteered to drive us to airport parking. It's about a two hour drive from our small town to the airport, so Uber or Lyft was out of the question. We're all excited for the trip, listening to the radio (a rap music station.) 
and about an 45 mins in, my best friends boyfriend (who is hispanic, it's important to know) starts complaining about the music. It was about 3 AM (yay early flights) and I didn't feel like being on AUX and my car won't allow others to connect to bluetooth while it's in movement. Other members of the group also say they'd rather listen to this than whatever the pop stations are playing at this hour. After about 10 more minutes of sly remarks and complaining, he blurts out ""I WISH you would turn off this damn N****R music!"". 

It felt like time stopped. Now, our group is pretty diverse. Mostly Hispanic, but a few white people and a couple of black. I'm not black, but i immediately looked at my girlfriend who is and i could see the shock and anger on her face. Before anyone could say anything I pulled over to the shoulder and parked. I told him either apologize or get out. He refused. Now I'm not a confrontational person, and he knows this. We've been acquaintances for more than 5 years. So I assume he thought he could just say no and I would budge and continue driving. Of course I didn't and repeated that he has two choices, either apologize, or get out. By now My best friend started apologizing for him and saying we need to go to make it to the airport but I responded saying I wasn't moving until he apologized for his racist remark. Others in the group told him just to apologize so we can go. He doubled down saying if I had changed the music this wouldn't have happened. 

Now I admit it was early, I was cranky but long story short he got out of the car with my best friend with him. I drove off after they got their bags. The rest of the ride no one spoke. While boarding the plane I made mental note that My best friend and her boyfriend weren't there. When we got to the hotel I apologized to my friends for making things so tense, because at the time I felt like I had ruined everything. They let me know that they agreed that what he did was wrong, but the group was 50/50 on if I overreacted. 
The next day they were both back with the group, but we weren't speaking. About three days into the 5 day vacation she messaged me saying it was awkward and we all should get together to hash it out. I told her we can, as long as he apologizes. She texted me back that he felt the same way, and I needed to apologize to him for trying to control him(?)
So that's where we are. I don't feel like I should apologize because while I feel remorse for making them miss their flight, it 100% could've been avoided. It's really causing a divide for us, this is our biggest fight. Her boyfriend is a bit controlling so talking to her by ourselves isn't an option. At the core I feel like he shouldn't have said it, and he said he feels like I have no right to tell him what he can and can't say. What should I do? I want to apologize for kicking them out, but I can't see the conversation going anywhere.   Her friendship really means a lot to me. 

TLDR: Best friends boyfriend says racist stuff before a vacation. I kick him out and she goes too. I want him to apologize he wants me to apologize. no more friendship. 

EDIT: I'm sorry for the confusion. My girlfriend is black, not my best friend. also i'm a girl too. gays exist, friends. ",relationship_advice
"[Update] Was I(25m) wrong for telling my wife(24f) ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you.""","[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av3aob/was_i25m_wrong_for_telling_my_wife_24f_if_im_not/)

I wanted to make a new topic on *probably* the final update to my situation because the old one was getting a little messy.

&#x200B;

First off, I wanted to again thank those that took the time to share their own personal stories, and those that offered suggestions on things I could talk about with her, or things we could do as a couple to get passed this. There were **a lot** of comments, and I read as many as I could. In a sea of hate, there are good people out there. I appreciate you folks.

&#x200B;

She got home from work last night, I made dinner, and we sat down together to eat. It has now been four days since my last shave. Which would be considered ""too fucking scruffy"" in my household. We talked about her day at work, then there was a pause after the subject. *""You're really fucking scruffy""* right now she tells me. But she said it in a slightly comical manner rather than her usual dead serious tone. A hybrid between the two. Oh, the moment I have been waiting for since I shared my experience with all you fine folks I thought to myself. *""Yeah. I know. But, I wanted to make a little deal with you this time and from now on. I'll shave. When you do.""* All while staring at her chin whiskers that were still clearly there. She stayed dead silent for awhile playing with the last of her food. *""Fine.""* she eventually replies. After dinner, she went to the bathroom, pulled out her handheld hair puller thing and cleaned herself up. She comes into the bedroom afterwards, looks at me and says *""Happy? Now it's your turn.""* So I did. And we all lived happily ever after. So far.

&#x200B;

Rather anticlimactic, I know, and I'm sorry if you were expecting more fireworks. But, I'm happy with the end result. Many redditors expressed ***""You're a fucking man! Not a child! Grow some balls and grow a beard if you want to grow a beard! Man up!""*** You're not wrong, you're just an asshole. Lol. When we agreed to marry each other, we very well knew each others flaws, and we also agreed to make sacrifices for one another. If all I have to do is sacrifice the viking beard I have dreamed of to keep her happy, then so be it. As long as she is sacrificing her Sensei whiskers for me.",relationship_advice
"My (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. Am I being unreasonable in ending it?","Last weekend I had arranged a week in advance for her to join me kayaking in Sydney harbor as it's something she's wanted to do.

&#x200B;

She  asked to reschedule at the last minute  to attend a house party with a work friends without inviting me. I agreed as a free day would help me focus going to the gym and personal errands etc.

&#x200B;

The following day we saw one another and she revealed she invited a male friend who is not a work friend but someone who is new to town and has no friends. Previous to this he had invited her to brunch which I expressed as not something I would do with the opposite particularly given she had to make it clear during it that she was dating someone.

&#x200B;

She had re-pieced her nose, and was acting distant the last few weeks. She stated he had a drink at her place and attended a house party together. My gut feeling suggested her inviting him instead of myself did not reveal much consideration for me and sat her down and said I would have to rethink seeing her.

&#x200B;

She said, she wanted to attend by herself, and that he asked to see her and she figured two birds one stone. She informed me without me having to ask which was good communication but was surprised I would see this as a disappointing action.

&#x200B;

She cried and I conceded I should give another chance, perhaps I was overthinking it.

&#x200B;

She has many male friends,some are long friends but some are men who to be frank probably are romantically interested and she likes the attention; as she's had a recent coffee date that he felt was a date.

&#x200B;

I spoke to her about this, and it appears she is unable to set clear boundaries besides communicating she is dating someone - as she has gone on 1 on 1 'dates'.

&#x200B;

I said, this is a boundary I am not comfortable with as it's not something I would do to my partner and perhaps we are not compatible.

&#x200B;

Am I being too old fashioned in this regard?

&#x200B;

Additionally, given the age difference, there is differences in maturity and values systems. At her age I was old enough to understand this behavior is naive at best or deceitful at worst as some of these friends have expressed romantic interest.

&#x200B;

Note she pursued me after a break up and I was also just a male friend.  I said to her I also have options with friendly members of the opposite sex but I set clear boundaries with female friends. I know my value, and feel that her actions reflect that she doesn't.

&#x200B;

Am I being unreasonable? I'd like some insights from objective third parties to see if I am simply holding her to a too high standard.

EDIT 

We just spoke and I disclosed that we were ending it. She reflected her perspective and we simply have different approaches to boundaries and other values which we differed on. She's a good woman, just not the woman for me.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] I (29F) found a bra under our bed. It isn't mine.,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ashm38/i_29f_found_a_bra_under_our_bed_it_isnt_mine/

Hello again everyone. I just wanted to say thank you to those of you who gave advice and support about my situation, and I just wanted to provide an update to let everyone know how it went.

For those who just wanna cut right to the chase; THE BRA WAS HIS!

I decided that the best course of action would be to confront him about it when he got home. I told him I needed to talk with him, and when we sat down I threw the bra on the table and told him to explain what the hell was going on. His immediate reaction was of guilt, and he didn't say anything for a while. This set me off because I was already stressed out and I began to cry, and yelled at him to tell me why he was fucking another woman.

He said that he wasn't cheating on me, and he hoped that it never came out, but he said the bra was his. He said that he likes to wear it sometimes and it must have ended up under the bed and he forgot to hide it. I was still crying and I told him that he was full of shit and I couldn't believe his excuse.

We sat in silence for a while before he eventually asked me to come with him. He took me into the spare bedroom and dug through the storage closet and pulled out a locked suitcase. Inside the suitcase was all of his crossdressing stuff; bras, underwear, stockings, dresses, etc. He even had the panties to match the bra to prove he was telling the truth.

I was honestly shocked and pretty blown away. I didn't really know how to react. He told me that he had been dressing up for many years, but it was purely sexual and no other reason. He said he didn't want to tell me because he didn't want to scare me away and lose me. He said he would get rid of it all.

I was still pretty speechless and couldn't say much about it. I didn't really know how to process it at first. We didn't really speak much about it that day, or much at all for the rest of the day either. I told him I just needed a bit of time to process it all. I asked him to sleep in the other room that night.

Upon having time to think I calmed down a lot. I think the relief that he wasn't cheating on me really sank in. I figured that what he was doing, while very weird to me, was pretty harmless. The next day I told him I was sorry for accusing him of cheating. He said he was sorry for hiding it. We talked about it for a while. I told him that he if he wanted to keep dressing up I would support him, and if he ever wanted to bring it into our sex life I would be willing to give it a try. He seemed happy about this but needs to think it over a bit more in the future.

I feel bad that I didn't trust him, but it is relieving to know the truth. Once again I wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice. To those of you who suggested the bra was his, I'm sorry I disregarded your suggestion. You were right all along.

tl;dr: Confronted husband about cheating. Turns out he was into crossdressing.",relationship_advice
I (26M) just broke up with my GF (26F). She was raped a year ago and my entire family hates me now.,"For background, I have been with my GF for 4 years. I realise she is technically my ex-GF, but it feels weird saying that, so I will just call her my GF.

Anyway we have been together for 4 years, and everything was amazing up until a year ago. She went to a party without me, drank way more than she should have, and was sexually assaulted by two of the men there. Both men were identified by people at the party, plead guilty, and convicted. 

After this my GF's personality completely changed. She no longer showed any affection to me and was, all things considered, very cold to me. She tried to blame it on me since I didn't go with her, something which I have always found fucked up. Even though she stopped showing me any affection, she got 100x more clingy in insisting I'm always with her, which wouldn't be so bad if she at least showed some affection when I'm around her.

We have never had any kind of sex since the incident. She very occasionally gives me a kiss, but only a kiss and nothing more. I can 100% understand her feeling uncomfortable with being intimate after what she went through, but she has made literally no attempt in the past year to work on this, or at least try and be intimate with me.

She has been going to therapy this entire time, but she is still as cold and distant to me as she was a year ago. I feel like she's not even my GF anymore, just a clingy loner that sucks the life out of me. I have tried to talk to her about how our relationship is suffering, but I have to stop because she immediately starts crying and asking me to forgive her, only for her to make no attempt to change afterwards.

As you can tell from my rambling tone, I am no longer happy in this relationship, and after making many attempts to help her I feel as though I need  to move on. I'm only getting older and I want to start a family and raise kids, and I feel as though there's no chance of that happening with her now in the state she's in.

So I broke up with her last week. I was straight to the point and then left without comforting her, because I knew that once she started crying and begging me to stay I'd eventually give in. I feel as though I've done enough to try and save this relationship and simply need to move on.

Ever since this my entire family has literally cut me out of their life. My mother and 3 sisters all blocked me on Facebook/WhatsApp and wont return my calls. The only message I got was an extremely upsetting email from my mum telling me how heartless I am for abandoning my GF when she needs me most. My dad passed away a few years ago so they are the only family I have. I feel as though I have to go back to my GF, who in all honestly makes me feel like shit when I'm around her, if I want to maintain a relationship with my family.

I am considering buying a plane ticket to go home so I can confront my mother in person, but other than that I have no idea what the fuck I am supposed to do. Probably a long shot but if anyone has any ideas on how I can repair my relationship with my family without getting back together with my GF, I'd much appreciate it.",relationship_advice

I saw that we being followed, felt concerned, documented it and brought it to the police. A restraining order is being filed no doubt, not sure if he'll press charges. I can ask but I don't like to pry. I let people mind their own business when it seems appropriate. All I know is that he's guaranteed she'll not bother us anymore. Now if you excuse me I'm gonna go finish the bottle of Delsym cough syrup and suck on a cough drop before heading out to buy more.

[Update to this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceccoj/my_friend_m25_is_being_stalked_and_no_one_not/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Following much of the advice offered, I managed to get a handful of pictures and videos. Cost me a couple bucks but it was worth it to prove I wasn't imagining things. Rather than go to the police, I opted to show my buddy. At first he was in denial (laughing it off as nonsense) until he noticed that the oldest picture I took was three days ago. He asked me if I had actually noticed her for a while now and I told him yes.

He seemed pretty overwhelmed, though he did apologize for doubting me. He says he'll think about what to do before we head off to work (neglected to mention that we work at the same place and live in the same apartment complex which is why I've noticed her a lot; sorry for the lack of forethought). He genuinely acts surprised, maybe a bit afraid. I'm wondering if I should take this to the police.

I'll post updates when they come, but I'm just glad he doesn't think that I need to be admitted to a psych ward and that he apologized.

EDIT 1

So a lot of people have been asking questions and while I'd like to get to each of them, it's difficult to Reddit and work at the same time so I'll be addressing the commonly asked questions and ones that struck a chord with me.

Q1) How do I know it's not me being stalked?

A1) It's a fair question. Honestly, I thought it was me at first but then I started traveling alone, watching myself. Either she's only following me when I'm with my friend or it's my friend who's being followed.

Q2) Is my friend in a relationship or legal troubles?

A2) No and no, as far as I know. Unless he's venting he does t talk about financial or legal troubles and he's still recovering from a break-up three months ago. And he's gay.

Q3) Does he recognize her?

A3) If he does, he didn't say anything to me.

Q4) Do you do pranks often?

A4) He's one of those people who likes being serious but appreciates a good joke, but this is something neither of us would want.

Q5) Consider hiring a PI.

A5) Tempting, and I will bring that option up if necessary.

Q6) Show us pictures.

A6) As much as I'd like to, I feel as though the sensitivity and uncertainty of the situation calls for caution. If things get dire enough, I'll consider it. If you doubt me because I refuse to post pictures, then that's you're decision. If you believe me or not doesn't change reality.

Q7) Is this fake?

A7) I fucking wish. I'd like nothing more than for all of this to be an elaborate hoax or joke that winds up me being the punchline.

We've decided to go to the police department after we get off work. We both work at the university FYI. More updates will follow afterwards.

EDIT 2 (7/24/19)

I would like to thank everyone for their concern and support. The matter has been resolved, and things are relatively returning back to normal. As far as I'm concerned, this just means I'll be able to finally get a decent night's sleep. Thank you and have a wonderful day.

EDIT 3

Sorry for the awful update.l, work is getting a bit hectic, as well as everything else since I'm going on a two week vacation soon with my family. So we secured a police car to watch over the complex until morning, which we then followed our usual routine. The lady returned once again and was finally apprehended. I'm not sure what will follow but I'll try to keep everyone posted in the next week or so.",relationship_advice
My [23] wife broke my [22] computer because she thought I was cheating,"I got off an 8 hour shift and got home to my wife blowing up my phone accusing me of cheating and when I arrived I found she broke my computer. She had spoken to my boss and got misinformation that I was lying about where I was, so she assumed I was cheating and when I got home told me she'd smashed my computer and hid it under the bed because she regretted it but she was still angry. After a long argument and me explaining she realized the boss gave her wrong info and I was right and she broke down and apologized and promised to buy me a new one, begging me to forgive her and saying she felt horrible and it wasn't on purpose. She should have trusted me, she's a piece of shit, whatever. I told her I wasn't leaving now but if she ever broke anything of mine again I was out, no questions asked I would pack my shit and be gone in a day.  I'm wondering if I should have left. I don't trust her anymore with my things and it just doesn't feel right that she broke my shit. Now we have to spend more money when we're already struggling. I'm just angry confused and scared to talk to anyone about it. I really don't know what to do. She promised me she would go to therapy but she's promised that before. Am I an idiot?

My(24M) brother(30M) is getting married next months to his fiancée(32F) of 3 years next month. I caught her cheating on him,"My brother is out of town for business and won't be back until Sunday and asked me to house sit. He only asks when neither him or his fiancée are there. No worries! It's his house and I  have keys.

Monday evening I go to his house expecting not to see anyone there and hang out with the dogs. . As soon as I walk into the house, the hear moaning from the living room. I walked into the living room and caught his  fiancée  having sex with some dude in my brother's house! They stopped when he saw me and both rushed to put clothes on but I was gone. She's been calling and texting me begging me to talk to her.

I love my big bro to death. Hurting him is the last thing I want to do and this WILL hurt him. They're getting married next month! I don't have the heart to tell him but I can't sit with this until he gets back.

EDIT: I'm calling him right now.

EDIT#2: I spent the last 2 hours consoling Adam. I told him everything(from me walking into the house to catching them). He cried. You could actually feel how depressed he got but I did it. I told him that I loved him and if he needs to talk some more, I'm only a phone call away. He asked me to pick him up from the airport on Sunday  and bring him to my place. I think he's going to be calling her sometime today but he asked that I'd stay awake in case he needs to call me again. I felt so bad for him. As for his "" fiancée "", I got noting. I did my part.....

EDIT#3: I got the dog. She wasn't at the house. I called her cell and messaged but no response. Sasha is now with me.",relationship_advice
My boyfriend expressed his rape fantasies after sleeping with me for the first time.,"Long time anon lurker, first time poster. I'm so utterly dumbfounded that I have no idea who to turn to.

Up until last night, I (21F) was a virgin. A late bloomer, I guess; I never had the time nor confidence to fool with it. I met my boyfriend (22M) seven months ago after signing up to my university's sign language society. We settled into a relationship about two months following that, so it was probably a little hasty in hindsight.

Things had been fine, and I'f been rendered utterly smitten. He's charming, well-kempt, and has been nothing short of understanding of my inexperience.

Last night, however, things took a really sharp turn. An evening spent on the wine had made us both a little comfortable and we went to bed together. I was initially happy to do so as everything leading up to that point had me convinced that he'd be gentle and thoughtful about it, but he wasn't. I was manhandled, pushed down, and he would insult me occasionally throughout the whole ordeal. I was tipsy and hurting, and at one point he even kept me held to the sheets by my neck when I tried to sit up. When he'd done, he left me until I'd almost fallen asleep, before rejoining me in bed. It hurt throughout the night, and I'm still really sore almost a full day later.

When I sobered up this morning, I asked him what went so wrong when he joined me in the dorm kitchen to get some water. He played it as though everything was fine, but I told him that I didn't feel fine. It's hard to pin how the conversation led, but he basically told me that one of his deepest fantasies was - in his words - ""defloration and conquest."" I was undeniably disturbed and basically blurted out the term rape fantasy. He got irate over this and described it as consensual non-consent. I became upset and removed myself from the kitchen when I heard my flatmate's door open, and I'm not sure what he did with himself following that.

I've not left my room since, and I've had an absolute flurry of messages from him that I can't bring myself to open. I feel dirty, and hurt, and stupid, and can't help but feel like I've been groomed as an object of this fucked fantasy of his.

I don't know where to go from here, or who to turn to. I'm desperately tempted to ghost him and just be done with it, but we each attend the same campus and its sign language class, of which I will likely quit.

I don't know if I'm overreacting and being too hard on him. I don't know if this is something I should raise, and if so, who to? I'm feeling god awfully irrational at this moment and wasn't sure where to express this, so here I am.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] My [27M] girlfriend [25F] of two years doesn't know I speak her native tongue," [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99pv4s/my_27m_girlfriend_25f_of_two_years_doesnt_know_i/?st=JMWRA7Z2&sh=d6d4a2bf) 

A lot of people thought the last story was fake. One of the common themes was that I learned the language too quickly. It is very possible to reach past A1 level in a language (being able to have a basic conversation) at around 3 months. Also, I am fluent in another language other than English that has a lot of similarities with German. The combination of the two made learning it much simpler. And I am going to continue improving in the language as it's become a hobby at this point. 

Anyway my life has took a complete 180. I was planning on never going on this account again, but I'm feeling better about everything and I hate when other people don't update so...

She did cheat unfortunately. 

I struggled with mental health for a large part of my life. I had suicidal tendencies ever since my first memories starting from the age of 5. My anxiety and depression continued to get worse but I never told anyone, and I know I hid it very well. This was a mistake. Eventually, I think I suppressed a lot of these memories and these feelings started becoming more sparse. My mental health has been good for a while before this happened.

We were still at the resort at this point. I should've waited until we were back home probably but I couldn't wait. We had two days left at the resort before coming home. As some users have mentioned I asked her about the situation in English. And If she lied I planned on speaking to her in German. I just asked her who was that guy. But she didn't lie. After about 10 seconds of stuttering she burst into tears and left. Again, the same feeling came upon me after she left. I felt like I was a spectator looking into my life and I had no control over my actions. I felt like I had so many emotions and no emotions going on at the same time. About half an hour later she texted me a very long message about every detail, everything that happened, and she apologized. I never answered. 

The short version of what happened:
Basically she went for a night time walk one night because she couldn't sleep while I was asleep early one night (we both do this often so I believe it). She ended up coming across some show thing they had going on in the resort and met some random people who were all drinking. They happened to be German. She decided to drink with them to have some fun, and ended up going back to that guy's room. She ended up really connecting with the guy aside from just sex. They exchanged numbers and were texting often when we were there. She felt horrible but she was confused. That's the gist. 

I'm trying to think objectively here and if she really likes this guy, as much as it hurts me, I always stress that people should do what they want and focus on their happiness first. He was also really damn handsome, I was too emotional to admit that in the last post. 

But I was not able to keep a straight mind after she left initially. I never had a reason to be angry before in my life, I know i have a temper but It usually takes a lot to get me even irritated. The feelings i had and the thoughts I had were so horrible that i don't feel comfortable typing it out. It was so hard to keep it in and I lost the ability to focus on reality. When I saw her the next time she wanted to talk to me and apologize in person but I felt like I didn't have the energy to say a word. I avoided speaking to her for the remaining days. I was trying my best to avoid my family but when I saw them I think I must've been acting weird because they clearly knew something was off. It was all very awkward going back on the plane, and not telling my family anything when it must've been so obvious something was off. I sat next to her on the plane. Which was so weird. At least she respected the fact that I didn't want to talk. She continued trying to talk and text me when we landed here and there. But at that point I never wanted to see or hear from her again so I blocked her from everything. 

When I came back I was acting very impulsively that entire week. My semester was about to start, but I quickly canceled all my classes and decided to take this semester off. I booked a vacation to a place I've always wanted to go to last minute. I bought a lot of random shit i don't need. I did some semi-hard drugs that I never imagined myself doing before. I had sex with multiple hookers. I got into fights with random guys at bars. I actually felt very good. I woke up every day feeling like I was on top of a mountain. But I came to my senses over a week after i came back from the resort. There was a stereotypical-cliche-movie-moment instant where I was puking in a club bathroom with that heartbeat music sound. I started laughing and realizing how I was fucking up my life. So I decided to see a therapist. Who then referred me to a psychiatrist (I guess I'm crazy). And I was diagnosed with BPD with bipolar 2. I've never heard of BPD before, but after reading into it I felt like a lot of the symptoms were things I've struggled with since I was very young. I guess this ""trauma"" really made the symptoms set off even worse. 

Today, I still have this semester off. I am continuing treatment and will probably start medication soon. I still haven't spoken to Grace. She contacted my sister but I didn't wanna hear what she had to say. I've been kind of avoiding my family and close friends, and I should stop that. I think i learned a lot about myself and definitely learned that i am not ready for a relationship. This was a wake up call. The anger and sadness has mitigated and I feel like myself again. I don't think anything else will happen so I won't be on the account anymore. Thanks for all the advice, I apologize for not answering anyone I just really didn't want to talk to anyone. But I read everything. And thanks for the pms too. 

Tl;dr: unfortunately she did cheat. I went nuts and started ruining my life with impulsive behavior. Stopped myself before it got to bad. Went to a psychiatrist. Working on my mental health. Feeling better now. 

Edit: woke up to a ton of messages and comments. Didn't expect the attention, but thanks everyone for the kind words. ",relationship_advice
[29F] I eavesdropped on my husband [30M] crying and now I don't know how to bring it up to him,"My husband and I have been together for ten years and married for seven. Right after we got married, I was diagnosed with sarcoma and had to undergo intense and invasive treatment for almost two years before I was officially cancer free. It was an awful time for us both, but it definitely made us stronger as a couple. Unfortunately, the cancer came back late last year, and we're going through nearly the exact same turmoil again.

My husband and I have been described as a good couple by many because we balance each other out. He's more of the rock, usually being more logical and blunt while I'm more emotional and imaginative. He grounds me and reminds me to be realistic, and I make him laugh and remind him to have a little fun every now and then. It's not complete night and day like that, and we're not caricatures, but that's the gist of our personalities and dynamic. It's always been this way. My husband did have to grow up faster than others in a lot of ways, as he was in and out of the foster care system at one point in his childhood and he had to help his mother provide for his younger siblings when he was still a child after his father got arrested. He has a strange relationship and dynamic with his family overall. I wonder if that played a small part in him being the way he is. He has dealt with depression throughout our relationship, even taking antidepressants and attending therapy during a few points. I take anti-anxiety medication and did go to therapy briefly during my cancer treatment, so I encouraged him and was supportive. He would always stop after a few months, saying he didn't like them and they weren't working enough to stop trying.

My husband has been incredible during my battles with sarcoma. He is always there to be with me during treatment. He has always been a shoulder to cry on and an ear to vent to during this process, letting me be emotional but also keeping me grounded with the facts. He has been very patient with me and understanding of my needs. He always seemed to have it together, as usual. He would acknowledge the bad situation but just make a plan to get through and execute. I would always tell him that I know it's hard for him too and he would say that it's not as hard for him, he's okay, and he doesn't want me worrying about me. He said this over and over again, so I would try to respect his wishes and listen.

Saturday night, I was lying in bed when my husband came in and told me that he was going outside to take a phone call and that if I needed anything, to call him. I didn't think much about it. Eventually, I got up and went into the kitchen to make some tea. I started to walk around the house waiting and heard my husband's voice from outside near the side of the house say something about his wife several times. I was a little startled, and initially, I just was going to walk away and ignore it. But I got a bad gut feeling, and decided to go check out what was happening. I moved a little closer and stood by the door.

My husband then said something about how he can't believe this is happening again. He said he feels so powerless watching me deteriorate and cry to him and not be able to do anything about it. He stopped talking for a bit then said something along of the lines of how it takes him a long time to get used to the way my body changes with the treatments and that he misses elements of my pre-cancer appearance, but then he feels awful and shallow for thinking that away because I didn't bring this onto myself; he said he feels like a shit husband when he feels this way because while he wants his wife to be sexually attractive, I'm worrying if I'm even going to survive. Then he said that goes into his worries about if he's even doing enough at all and if he's good enough for someone like me. He then stopped and said he's sorry. I was confused at first but then I realized that he was crying. Like heavily crying. He said that he doesn't like to talk about how he's feelings and cry or show his emotions, and that he's trying to put on a brave face, but it's difficult. He went on to say that he's scared and he really can't lose me, and he'd probably kill himself if he did because I'm the only constant in his life and the only person who loves him unconditionally. I was really caught off guard, as I'd never vaguely seen or heard my husband talk or cry in any way before. I felt a sudden bout of anxiety building up, so I walked away. I came back about twenty minutes later, and my husband was saying he feels bad about calling when ""they're"" so busy and he's sorry about getting emotional, it's not normally like him, he got overwhelmed vocalizing everything. I walked away again.

I went back to bed, and was confused and anxious about everything I'd heard. An hour later, my husband came to bed and seemed tired but fine. I immediately asked him if he was okay, and he said he was. I didn't know what to say to that so I just cuddled him and we went to sleep.

Yesterday morning, my husband wanted me to look for some video on his phone, and while I had it in my hands, I looked at the call history to see who he was speaking to. It turns out it was a emotional crisis hotline. My husband appeared to have called them several times before but only spoke to them that night.

I don't know what to do. This changes everything. I can't believe him now, he's not doing fine and I do need to worry about him. Seriously worry. He's suffering and doing it in complete silence. I feel strange and deeply anxious when I think about him crying like that. He doesn't want me to see him vulnerable and upset. He doesn't want to be open about how he's feeling. I can only imagine what else he's thinking, how he's making himself feel guilty for it, and how many times he's cried like that in isolation or to strangers on the phone. I don't know what to do. Yesterday, I wouldn't leave his side. I asked him how he was doing constantly and gave him a lot of physical attention. I was scared to leave him alone. He kept saying he was fine and to stop worrying. He thought I was being weird, but he enjoyed it and didn't want me to stop. He left for work now, and I'm just sitting here not sure what to do.

Do I confront him on it? Do I just do my part to try and make this easier for him? Do I suggest that he gets back into therapy? Do I try to open up a dialogue another way? He doesn't and won't tell me the truth, just acting like he's fine all the time. I'm so worried about him.

**tl;dr; My husband of seven years called an emotional crisis hotline and cried speaking to them about him struggling with my sarcoma. This was the first time I've ever caught my husband being emotional and expressing how things have been affecting him. He has always said, and still will, say that's he's fine and not to worry about him. I don't know what to do and feel deeply worried and scared about him now.**",relationship_advice
My step daughter (16) is pregnant. I (31F) am the one who pays for most of her education and I want to cease. Her dad (33M) is disappointed in me. How do I proceed to make my point clear to my husband and step daughter?,"I posted in AITA, throwaway because husband uses reddit. English is not my first language. There is really no good TL;DR other than the title, but that leaves a lot of important info out, still TL;DR at the end. My questions are bolded.

**The reason behind why I pay for the education.**

My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant. An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition, I do so as a payback from when my husband helped me out of a massive debt during our dating years when he made 5 times what I did during that time. He proceeded to gain the international/regional direction of a big company in our country and worked there for some years before he decided to start his own company. Now I make three tomes more than what he is making, but I'm sure he'll double what I'm making within the next 5 years. It had always been my husband who paid for all of An's expenses, her mother took care of her from ages 0-13 while husband provided with money for everything and visited every weekend. We divide all of the other household expenses equally. An's mom has NOT given anything towards child support on the last two years because she insists she has no money.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream and even study in the London School of Economics (just like her dad with his masters). I have been separating some money for this purpose, too. My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. An was not involved in this conversation because husband feared she would tell her mom and mom would take it as an offense and me saying teen moms are sluts or things I never even implied (she's that kind of person). This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first HS year.

**Why is An pregnant and what about the future teen dad?**

I cannot be nice about it. An is pregnant because her mother has a turd instead of a brain. My husband and I started talking to her about sexuality, contraception (I even taught her to put on a condom in a cucumber, it was awkward but oh well), orientations, etc... and actually took her to the gyn and he recommended her the pill. She stopped taking it because her mom told her she would get fat (An was a chubby child and suffered bullying because of her mom), and started using the ""cycle method"" in which she had sex some days before, during, and some days after her period. 

An met a boy her same age in some of her extra-curricular classes. He is not from a well of family, and not a bad guy. I've already talked to the boy's parents and they've agreed to pay something like $300 a month if An decides to keep the baby. That covers two thirds of a reputable daycare for 7 hours a day. We've all agreed that it's next level idiotic to have them marry each other (that seems to be the *way to go* in my country whenever someone impregnates another someone).

**What I'm planning to do**

I plan on taking the money being used towards her education and use part of it towards child support. Per month, I pay the equivalent of 1100 towards her HS (the best one in the country). Her dad has the means to either pay a not so high-end private HS, but definitely a decent one. I also plan on use the money I've been saving for her university in things like my retirement. I have not made an ultimatum towards her. My plan is to tell her that due to her having a child, I'll use the money that used to go to her education towards the unborn being. If she keeps the baby I will not pay for any private university. I firmly believe bio mom needs to step up.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An, but I don't feel so because I'd still be giving her for child support. It's not like I'm leaving her in the streets. **How do I make him understand my reasoning? I truly don't want to be the evil step mother who has no heart and ""cut the step daughter out"", and I also believe he is thinking viscerally with what's the best for his child as he did not experience the teen mom hardships. I want him to understand why I'm not planning to give her everything in a silver plate,** even if I could make an extra sacrifice for paying child support and fancy HS.

**What is happening at the moment.**

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy. An is unsure, and in my heart I believe she does want to terminate, but... her mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

**I want An to understand that what she did was a mistake, that I love her and that I am not punishing her, but that it is not within my reach for us to live comfortably, pay for a fancy school that she will not be able to take fully advantage of, and have a step grandchild at the age of 31.** How do I make a teen feel all that without fucking our relationship? She is a nice kid, but takes after some of her mom's bad traits, such as feeling any type of advice is an attack or every consequence is a punishment.

I truly believe the right way is for her to terminate, not give up for adoption or raise it herself. I do not want to force her to terminate, but I do want her to see where I'm coming from. I also don't want this to fuck over my marriage, I believe dad is hot headed right now. He is disappointed in An, but he's also disappointed in me because he thinks I'm not giving my fullest as I usually do.

**TL;DR: Step-daughter got pregnant due to some belief her dead-beat bio mother gave her. I am the one who pays for her tuition but am planning on stopping that in order to give it for child support if she decides to keep it. I could do both, but I feel that's not my baggage. How do I make my husband understand this? How do I break the news to An without it sounding like an ultimatum of ""abort or I'll stop paying school""?**",relationship_advice
I'm (34m) really into this girl (27f) who is the complete opposite of me. I'm afraid dating her will ruin my reputation. What should I do?,"A friend of mine decided to get a tattoo, and asked me to go with him. He made an appointment with a popular local tattoo artist. I really ended up hitting it off with her. I went through a bad break up last year, and haven't had much luck dating since, so I decided what the hell, I'll try a little strange, and asked her out for a drink.  It went great.  Really great. We've been seeing each other for about two months now. 

Here's my problem, I'm pretty straight laced. I come from a conservative family, I have a conservative job, my bosses are country club types, I wear a suit to work and play golf on the weekends. She on the other hand is heavily tattooed, which I always found trashy before but for some reason I find it incredibly sexy on her. She's slightly punk, and is all around the opposite of me. 

If I decide to get serious with her, my family is going to freak out, I can't see them ever approving of her.  She will hurt my reputation at work and not be good for my career. It sucks but is just straight up true. My friends think it's weird that I'm dating her and think I'm going through something because of my break up. And this is going to make me sound like an asshole but I am a little worried about what my ex is going to think. I feel like she'll think I'm trying to get back at her for dumping me.  

Here's the thing though, I'm crazy about this girl. She's gorgeous, successful, driven (wants to open her own shop), off the charts confident, talented, smart, sexy and just all around cool. Sex with her is without a doubt the best I've ever had. She's uninhibited and does things to me that I didn't know I wanted. It's dirty and primal. I've had to start jerking off before I see her because I don't last more than two minutes otherwise. She laughs at my shitty jokes. We have a lot in common, like we both love action movies and whiskey. She's introduced me to things I never would have even given a chance before.  Honestly if it weren't for the judgement, I would marry her tomorrow. 

I've worked really hard for my career and I'm not sure I want to potentially jeopardize it.  But on the other hand I've never felt this way about anyone. She's everything I didn't know I wanted. I'm torn. Really really torn. 

Should I say fuck it and go for it with her?

Edit:  I want to thank everyone for their comments, especially the harsh ones. It's really made me take a hard look at myself and I realize that this is 100% about my hang ups. I have been a lot more judgmental than I ever stopped to consider.  I'm going to work on changing that about myself. 

I'm going to go for it, I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't. I'm going to tell her how I feel about her tomorrow. This may have been premature (depending on how tomorrow goes) but I called my sister and told her about my  (hopefully) new girlfriend.  She was supportive, but she did share the same concerns about our parents. But fuck it, and soon as she's open to it, I'm going to have her meet them. 

Hopefully I'll have a good update tomorrow!  
Thanks again.",relationship_advice
"I [32m] am at the finish line with my ex [29f]. Do I let it go peacefully, or become karma incarnate?","Hey folks. Seeing a few fantastical, fake stories around this sub, and given recent events, I decided to finally get to the dirt of my story, and unmuck things with the truth. I'll back up every claim with pictures as best I can as well, probably in an edit. There's also a **TLDR** at the bottom to get straight to the point, and another **TRIGGER** section to get to the juicy stuff, so this next part will be the backstory of it all and my perspective. What I'm asking, is your opinions on what you would do at this juncture, given the same situation. To that end, I'm going into great detail to get you in my head space, so...long post incoming, but there's some handy skip points for your pleasure! Anyhow, on with the show!

# Backstory

&#x200B;

My wife was the perfect person for me. She was not only everything I wanted, but was also everything I didn't know I needed. We were infatuated with one another, to the point that she missed out on a prominent internship just to spend the summer with me (albeit, she still got valuable job experience thanks to my family ties in the area). In return, I moved to RI to spend the next year with her for her senior year of college. I moved us into a gorgeous apartment in the heart of Providence, and paid a hefty sum for the rent, but it was the best year of my life. I got to live with the person I loved most, and actually get a preview of living together, and it was amazing. I had never felt this way about another person before, but I didn't ever want to jump the gun or become too clingy. She definitely had more dating experience, so I looked up to her in a way, to be sure I wasn't crossing any lines or making her uncomfortable. She put all my worries to rest though, when after almost 3 years, she asked ME to marry HER. I was floored...But with her encouragement, I still wanted to make a spectacle of it, and so I proposed to her in front of all her family, friends, and some of her teachers at her graduation party. Even though she knew it was coming, boy...her tears streamed down her face and she clung to me and squeezed like I was her favorite stuffed animal (she called them stuffies).

&#x200B;

Our life, for 4 years together, was like a never ending Honeymoon. We lived for one another, sickeningly affectionate, each other's best friends, wonderful and active sex life (at least once a day, sometimes twice). I would do anything for her at the drop of a hat, especially as it seemed she had an unfortunate run in other relationships and friendships. She was so underprivileged, so I made it my life's goal to make up for all that, with not only presents and experiences (vacations, resorts, etc.), but most of all with the love and respect she so desperately deserved. I told her that, no matter how bad things were for me before or what mistakes I made, that I would never change a thing in my past or hers, as it made me who I was then and there and brought us together. After we married, we found ourselves a nice ""first house"", and got decent jobs, things moved along like clockwork. My friends loved her, my family adored her (Mom and Dad especially), she got along well with everyone and I was so proud to show her off! I made sure that, even though we were in my neck of the woods, that she NEVER felt like an outsider or that anyone was against her, and if they were, I removed them from my life. We missed spending as much time as we did before because of the work, but hey, it was time to go full on adulting! At the end of our 4th year together, however, something started to change...

&#x200B;

She became...irrational, hysterical, about the smallest things. It got to be so bad, that I took off 3 weeks from work to nurse her, and shuttle her around to different specialists to try and get to the bottom of her problems. I adopted two cats so she had some more company if she was home and I wasn't. I picked up extra hours at my job to make up for her job not giving her full time hours, and she refused to change jobs due to her delicate mental state. The love was there, but with a huge cloud over it. I could barely ever see my friends or family because of how much alone time she demanded, and then our sex life completely dried up, at the time because I thought it was her medications. It became like having 2 full time jobs, but I never minded because it was a labor of love. My body did though, and I had, what I thought, was a heart attack at the time. It was a panic attack, however, that sent me to the hospital, I was simply too overworked and over stressed. I just wanted my poor princess to be better again, I would do anything...What she then really wanted was to go back home and live with her parents together. This was it...THE biggest mistake I could ever make. I knew this was a toxic place, that messed with her so badly before, that she was different when we went to visit, but...I was desperate to fix her, and if this was it, I had to do it. I packed everything up, and moved us all the way north to Maine. The beginning of the end.

# TRIGGER (AKA, the juicy stuff)

As a quick aside, her father was and is a great man, and the sole provider at their household, and looking at him, I found out why she loved me so much, I was just him but younger/not blood related. Her mother though...Is a narcissistic, lazy, drug addled, entitled cunt. That becomes important, I promise you. Oh, also another aside, anything that you think was obvious? Like ""Oh yeah man, of course she was doing THAT..."" Oh, just wait...It was always worse than you think. Just say to yourself, ""BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!"", amplify it 3 fold, and then you have an idea of how fucked things are. For me personally, the living situation was atrocious. The house was a disaster, junk and filth everywhere, acrid smoke from cigarettes and weed clung to all the clothes and furniture. Her parents were poor and massively in debt, so...I suppose you know who had to cover every extra expense, besides the normal living expenses. Just a month after getting there, the ex wrote a check for over 4k out of our savings to pay for their property taxes from the previous year, and that's only the start of that. I had no room to myself, no privacy, and no way to clean or make room, as I wasn't allowed to touch or move their stuff (pictures included below). So, yeah, seventh circle of hell living situation, couldn't leave because she didn't want to, and couldn't leave because she was constantly siphoning off cash to cover her parents bills, because her mother refused to work. Anyhow, continuing below!

&#x200B;

We moved into her parent's house/her childhood home, as that is the only place she is willing to be. I had just given up my own home, all my friends, family, contacts, and comfort to be here with her, as well as I was dealing with the sudden and tragic death of my Aunt, so I didn't exactly hit the ground running. Luckily, I had virtually no bills or debt, so I didn't cost anything while looking for a job. She got a job right away, and I was so proud of her, straight to GM at a restaurant! It was almost immediately, but...the love was gone. Nothing, I was treated like a stranger and a burden. She never wanted to spend time with me, avoided me, and started to become increasingly aggressive. I couldn't even believe this was the same person. This was my reality for all 3 years of me being there, as she became increasingly violent and abusive, to the point of physically attacking me, gaslighting, and starving me emotionally/intimately. It was hell on earth, the love of my life was also my tormentor. After those 3 years of begging, pleading, trying to get us to counseling, collaborating, and fighting, I gathered up as much as I could and ran back home by myself. I almost ended my life a few times up there, as it was preferable to living without her or living with this twisted new version of her, but with the aid of my family and some drugs, I somehow pulled myself together and got out.

&#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, to start, only 2 months into being back in ME, she started an affair with a co-worker. This guy could hardly speak any English, but she has this...fetish for Latino people, odd ducks, and older men, so this guy drew her attention. I was somewhat aware that her huge shift in behavior had to be from cheating, all the signs were there, her talking about him a lot, comparing, defensive of him, treating me like garbage, etc. This is where the gaslighting came in heavy though. You see that beautiful picture I painted above of how I loved her? She knew how much she meant to me and how much I loved and respected her, so of course, it was unconscionable that she would EVER do that to me...right? Any questions or insinuations that there was something going on, she made me feel so guilty for EVER suspecting her. Eventually, I dug around, and found some even more obvious truth. She erased any texts, but not pictures she had...SO many pictures of him, some without his shirt on, and then...a naked picture of her, one she never sent me for sure. I confronted her on this finally, and she admitted to it...in part. She said it was just emotional and flirting, and swore on everything that nothing physical ever happened. I believed her at the time, and go back into ""caretaker mode"", because her grandmother passed away, so I bury my broken heart and rush to be her rock. Seems like that's all to that story? BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! 

&#x200B;

Much later, I find out through her old ex fiance, that she was facilitating threesomes between her, him, and the co-worker. Taking showers together, oral sex, anal, everything. This was going on for 5 months. So, not even tip of the iceberg, I was completely out of my depth. She...was a master manipulator, I was no match at all. She had me, her father, all these other men, all in her pocket, and only giving nuggets of truth to keep us all off guard and weary of one another, all except her. Her ex fiance? Well, he seemed like a hopeless orbiter for a long time, trying to maintain a friendship, but always hoping she'd come back to him. When I was working my ass off after finding a job, and she crashed her car into her own restaurant out of rage (its own story), she was routinely going to his house and jerking him off, having sex, etc. THAT'S how she kept him on the hook, and reaped all the benefits of his money and attention. Her needy friend that she made out to be a hopeless clinger? Turns out she actually initiated a gay relationship with her when they were 14/15, and used that to give her the devotion she craved, but was too embarrassed to let anyone know she was bi-curious, so swore her to secrecy. When she became inconvenient, my ex swept this poor girl under the rug, and pretended it never happened. Source: The old friend admitted it to me, and my ex confirmed it, even though I figured it out long ago, I trusted her word that nothing ever happened (see a pattern?).

&#x200B;

**(Warning, graphic content ahead)**

&#x200B;

Other co-workers? Turns out, after she got her new job (after 7 months of not working while I paid her debts), she was fucking around with them too, and if someone drew attention to her being married and denied her advances, she accused them of being gay. Her...teachers? Yup, she fucked them in college, and the one when we moved back to ME. One of them, an elderly man at the age of 60, was on the damn culinary board at the college. No wonder she got valedictorian then, eh? She left her email open on my computer, when she was too lazy to use her own PC...and some of the stuff I found was...well, I don't have words for it. They were in constant correspondence, in school and out, for years after. The Piece de Resistance for THAT? The, BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE moment?! Though it predated me, it was, and I shit you not....a fucking **Sex Contract**...SIGNED by her ex fiance, her, and him. It stated that...She would marry the fiance, who would get to use her sexually whenever and put on the show of ""married couple"", while he would willingly allow her to carry on her affair with her married, 60 year old teacher, and would eventually carry and bear said teacher's child, as he never had one. The fiance would then raise said child as his own, so the teacher could carry out his primal desire to pass his genes on, she would get her love affair, and the fiance would get the sex that she constantly held over him. What the fuck did I walk into? I only have PROOF of one teacher, but I highly suspect a few others, given their odd tendencies and attachment towards her.

&#x200B;

Just...SO much was hidden from me, so much I was blinded from, and she so maliciously abused my love and trust in her to keep on doing it. Any time I questioned her, she went on the defensive, and was a master of arguing. If she was drunk, she would get extra crazy, and in two instances, struck me. After I started putting all the pieces together, it was obvious. She was a rampant narcissist that thrived on attention and control , but worst of all...she was just plain psychotically evil. I don't even just mean with me, she was malicious to some of the people who loved her most, way before me and throughout her whole life, and she destroyed so many other lives and situations just to feed her ego. I couldn't believe it...how did I fall for it all this time? How did my whole family fall for it? She never once had to pay the consequences, and now...after taking me and my family for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and abusing me for 3 years, almost to my own demise, she happily moved on to her next victim. He's some rich 50 year old Colombian business man, that she was screwing while I was paying for her medical bills and taking us to long-distance marriage counseling, because I was STILL attempting to save the marriage when I left Maine to save my sanity.

&#x200B;

# The Point?!

&#x200B;

So...after ALL that...What am I here for? Well, simple. I'm at the end, with the divorce papers in hand, ready to send them in and end this nightmare, cut her out of my life for good. I'm still tortured daily at what my best friend and soul mate became, or truly was all along, and it's preventing me from forming any new meaningful relationships or even being somewhat happy anymore. I'm not in any sort of suicidal ideation, but I get a sickening amount of relief by just imagining myself out of existence. I've never been a scorched earth kind of guy, and I still can't imagine causing any physical harm to her or anyone, but...Should I still do SOMETHING? She extorted me, during and after the marriage ended, for our marital property and even my OWN property. 

&#x200B;

She kept everything from the marriage, including our babies, the cats. Even my new TV I just got...She guilted me to letting her father keep it, which I kinda let happen, since I'd be dead if not for him, I owe him that much. If I take her to court, she won't be able to pay anything, without me around, she already has to work 2 jobs to make up for my income to support her and her parents. It would be almost just to be petty and bleed her out, but...then I risk hurting her father in the process. This is probably my only chance to do something court wise, before the papers are signed, but...Is that the only avenue? Should I even BOTHER being the avatar of vengeance for all the people she hurt and lives she ruined, or just hope it comes naturally down the road? She's gotten away with so much already...so many lives, adultery, and straight up felonies that I have proof of...Do I just let it go, and hope for karma? Or am I MYSELF the karma? I know what I would normally do, and that's just let it go and try to manage somehow, but...so many of the people in my life are suggesting different paths, so I come to you, the faceless masses. What would YOU do given a position power after being down and out so long?

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

Ex wife is absolutely crazy, and tortured me maliciously for 3+ years. I have evidence of all her misdeads, legal or not, and am ready to sign divorce papers. Do I act on both pettiness and a sense of duty and try to get some stuff back/make her pay for her crimes, or just cut all losses and hope she gets what's coming to her later?

&#x200B;

Anyhow, feel free to ask questions, point out inconsistencies if I made any narrative mistakes, and so on. I tried to organize this word vomit, but it was done with a lot of emotion and pain, so it's not always as coherent to me as it may be you. It's probably why a good amount of what I post gets ignored anyhow, but live and let live! Pictures will be included of my living conditions in an edit, so you know I'm not overblowing it, and perhaps others upon request.

I think my husband might have caused our neighbor to commit suicide,"My husband and I live in a neighborhood where the houses in the street behind us have their garages facing ours. We share a connecting back alleyway. One morning, our neighbor's daughter was pulling out from her driveway when the back of her car hit our fence. It shook the fence but besides a smear of paint from her car and a decent sized crack in one board, there was absolutely no damage. We were both in the backyard when it happened so we knew what she had done. 

My husband went out to confront her. She started screaming and sobbing uncontrollably, begging him not to tell her father and repeatedly saying that he would ""kill her"" if she found out. She offered us money from her own savings to fix the fence. My husband accepted the money, which she brought us immediately. She kept asking if he would tell her father and he assured her that he wouldn't. After paying us, she left for the day. It was about 100 dollars in cash, although we had the boards and tools to fix the fence without any cost to ourselves. I wasn't happy but he insisted that it was good for her to learn a lesson in responsibility and safe driving. 

Later that week, we learned from our next door neighbor that the daughter had committed suicide. I believe that's what happened because another neighbor next door to the daughter's house confirmed hearing shouting and seeing an ambulance outside the house while my husband and I were at work. My husband was pale and shaken for a day or two after. When I finally asked him why he was taking it so badly, he told me that after the daughter left and I'd gone inside, he waited until the father came home from work and told him that his daughter had not only hit his fence but paid for us to keep it a secret. He said the father seemed angry and slammed the door but didn't say anything else.

I doubt the father murdered her; i have the mother on facebook and she is posting openly about her daughter's suicide which I don't think she could do if there was a murder investigation. I do think my husband took advantage of a frightened girl and reported her to an abusive father. He wants my support and to attend trauma counseling but every time I look at him, I'm just disgusted. I think about how he took her money and lied to her face. I don't want to throw away a decade worth of marriage but when he asks me to tell him it isn't his fault, I just stay quiet. We have no children together but he's the only family I have. I need advice, I don't know what to do. ",relationship_advice
My wife is going to have sex with other men,"Title says it all. My wife, Beth, and I are 50. 3 kids last just graduated and started new job in May. Been married 27 years. 2 kids are married the daughter is 5 months pregnant with 1 st grandchild. This past Friday family celebrated  Beth's 50 th. She was stay at home mom until about 13 years ago. She started a career has done great. We are almost equal in pay. We are not rich, still a mortgage but life is comfortable.

Saturday I was finishing my breakfast. She sits down across from me and says""I need to tell you domething"". She pauses. I am like okay what is it? Take a deep breath and says ""I am going to start having sex with other men"". I just stare waiting for a smile to crack. None. I ask her to repeat it. She does still no smile. Now I am WTF does that mean. She goes on to explain for the last 10 years she has had the pact with herself, the kids will be gone, job is good, our life is good, she wants to do this for herself. Again WTF. We were married in our early 20's, only partners, she feels she missed out. Now that she is 50 she wants this new life. She wants the marriage opened up. I asked if I had any say. Nope. She hoped I would look elsewhere also. She wants to stay married.

Now I am going apeshit. I am yelling, crying, sobbing, all the emotions of betrayal. I asked if I did anything to cause this. No all her.  I left the house to drive nowhere. I called her best friend from childhood, Clare. She confirmed they had talked about this off and on over the years. They have a group of friends they do their girls night out etc. 2 are single, 4 married. The 2 singles delight the group with their exploits. Clare says they all have a yearning but Beth is the only one following through. I should point out I will be talking to Clares husband, we are good friends.

So I have no one to talk to about this. Parents on both sides are alive in their late 70's. I called my brother 1000 miles away. He was blown away, no advice. I did call a  lawyer on Monday. Will meet next week. In the mean time he advised not to move out, change locks, or change living arrangements as that could come back to bite me. He said take lots if notes, and above all no physical confrontation. That would not be a problem.

Sunday I went in for round 2. I asked if she was going to date these guys, no just sex. How were they to meet. A girlfriend was to set her up on sites.  I was worried about her safety. Girl friends  would be close by on initial meetup. They would also know where and when the hook up would take place. They would know when and where the hookups take place.

I know there are some weird ass posts on Reddit. I need to Google half the things people write with all the acronyms,  initials and just plain different lifestyles. Has anyone got advice or heard of something like this? I took Monday off from work to collect my thoughts but that didn't work. She is just going about her life unfazed by this.",relationship_advice
"Am I (22M) A ""Bad Guy"" For Breaking Up With My GF (23F) After She Tried To Commit Suicide.","I don't know whether I'm writing this to get more opinions on how I handled the situation or if I'm just looking validation on my decisions.

My GF and I have been together for nearly 2 years. We've had our problems and good times just like any other couple will, except she's constantly had to deal with her mental health declining and improving constantly. I've been through multiple self-harm attempts, mental breakdowns and suicide attempts, but recently this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

I lost my job last Tuesday, and the next day I was home with GF (we share an apartment). The morning started off really well with us joking with each other and laughing at ridiculous posts on Facebook. I spent the next 2 hours job hunting online and when it was time for my GF to go to work I went over to talk with her and saw she was taking her anxiety meds. Or so I thought. She took a big pinch of pills and swallowed them right as I was sitting down to talk to her. It didn't really click for half a minute or so before I realized just how many pills she was taking. I confronted her and asked how many she took and after a brief back and forth she threw an empty pill bottle towards me. The medicine she took was nearly full with 29 pills that she ingested.

I freak out and tell her she has to throw up right now and she refuses and breaks down. After another short fight I call her father and tell him what's going on and he tells me to essentially call the police if she won't go. I absolutely break down and plead with her to go to the hospital with me. She finally does and we make it to the parking lot where she finally throws up multiple times. Long story short, we get her into a room and she is given an IV and is doing fine now. Her parents showed up 2 hours later (due to distance) and she is now in a behavioral management unit and is being monitored in the hospital. For the next day after I wasnt able to process anything. Nobody checked up on me, which is mainly my fault because I told everyone I was okay, and the day went by in a blur.

This brings me to Thursday. I went to visit my GF with her sister in the hospital and during the visit my GF got mad at me for asking my aunt for advice on the situation. I walk out visibly upset and go to sit in my car. My GF calls me and asks if I'm going to leave her, and after a short pause I say yes. It was probably the hardest thing I've had to do in a long time and I felt like such a dick for doing it at a time like this when I knew she was at her lowest point, but I realized that I couldnt do it anymore and that she was being monitored for now so she couldnt do anything drastic and would be able to talk about it to the provided therapists at the hospital. I called her parents right after and absolutely broke down. I haven't cried that hard since my mom died and no matter how hard I tried I couldnt stop crying. I walked back into the hospital afterwards to talk to her and finally let her know that I'd be leaving and moving out. She begged me to stay and reconsider, but there's absolutely no way we can make it work right now. She needs to improve herself and work on her mental health before I could even try to be with her again.

It's hard. It's so fucking hard to walk away from everything. I love her family, our apartment, and most importantly, her. I'm not ready to be alone again. I'm not ready to not have someone to hold on the night's when it gets really hard to see the light. I'm moving back to my home town to be around family and friends, but theres so much to do and I don't know where to go from here. I dont even know what I'm hoping to gain from this post. Any advice I can get would be greatly appreciated. Even if you don't have anything to add, thanks for taking the time to read this. I wouldn't wish this shit on my worst enemy.

TL;DR: My GF tried to commit suicide and I'm mentally broken and unable to continue the relationship.",relationship_advice
My girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met,"I figured I should ask for advice because this situation is really weird and I have no idea how to handle it.

My girlfriend ""Maggie"" and I have been together for just 3 months so our relationship is still very new. Things have been going well aside from this problem:

A few weeks ago, Maggie started a new job and quickly became friends with her new co-worker ""Joe."" For the record, I have no problem with Maggie having male friends. I have female friends and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But Maggie and Joe seemed unusually close after a very short amount of time. Like Maggie was telling me that she was scoping out her co-workers to see who was all business and who she could joke around with and maybe become better friends with. She said it would be pretty easy though, because Joe was telling her who was cool. But Maggie barely knows Joe, so why does she trust him so much?

Maggie and Joe were hanging out so much outside of work that I actually did feel a little weird about it. I then found out that aside from work they usually hung out with Joe's wife and kids, which made cheating unlikely but was still really weird. Most people don't have near strangers hanging out with their little kids that much.

Maggie has been putting this family above other friends, like when she waited on rsvp'ing to a friend's party until she could nail down other plans with Joe and his family. The plans with Joe's family were very vague and hadn't been decided yet, but Maggie was willing to miss her friend's party if it was the only time Joe's family was available.

I met them for the first time, and it was very bizarre. Maggie isn't a big fan of kids but she was all over Joe's kids. She got down on the floor and crawled around with the baby. The older kid was very shy and didn't seem that comfortable with me but she got very excited when she saw Maggie and climbed into Maggie's lap, so Maggie has obviously spent a lot of time with the family in the past few weeks. The older kid calls Maggie ""Auntie."" Maggie once told me she didn't like babysitting and always tries to get out of it, but apparently she has babysat for them, and she refuses to take money for babysitting. This is just so out of character for her. They also made some weird jokes about Maggie coming to live in their basement??? which was really weird in combination with everything else that is going on. (Hopefully that was just a joke).

For Thanksgiving, we decided to just celebrate with our own families because we haven't been together that long. Joe and his family weren't able to travel far to meet their own family, so Maggie invited them to her parents house. That's very kind, but it was a couple hours away and they all slept over, so it wasn't a casual trip. Some pictures were taken, including a posed one of Maggie and Joe's family, with the older kid hugging Maggie's shoulders. Maggie made a comment about how she was glad her ""chosen family"" could come to Thanksgiving. It is beyond bizarre, she barely knows these people! She has been in the new job just under two months and somehow become absorbed into this random family. 

And this is so out of character. She told me once that she hates it when people she doesn't know well insist on hugging her or how cheaply some people say ""I love you"" but she is taking this up to 11. She is fretting right now because the oldest kid's birthday is coming, and Maggie apparently needs to get that kid a birthday and a Christmas gift and a Christmas gift for the baby, too. The only gift I'd ever gotten a co-worker s kid is when they had a baby shower at work.

I don't even know how to bring this up. I know her friendships aren't really my business, but this is so strange it's making me uncomfortable so I feel like I have to say something, but I don't even know what to say. Maggie cheating on me with Joe would actually make more sense than this. Any advice? This isn't normal, right?",relationship_advice
My (22F) boyfriend (21M) called me by his friend's (19F) name during sex,"Sorry I'm kind of mad right now. 

I'll keep it simple. My bf has this (semi best) friend who he has known for 2 years. We've been together for almost 1 year. He hangs out with her sometimes and goes to the gym with her. I've brought up boundaries a few times, because I believe that she can get too comfortable around him (e.g. long hugs, sending him outfit pics). He brushed it off at first but realized I was serious about it. And I'll admit that I've had a very strong urge to snoop the past few weeks, which is unhealthy I know. Mainly because they've been hanging out more, and I yes, I'm relatively jealous. She's fit and likes to show off. I don't *want* to see her as competition but part of me does.

So we were having some fun, and I heard him moan something but I couldn't hear it. Fast forward a few minutes and he does it again, and he's saying his friend's name. I stop, he asks what's up. I tell him what happened, and he denies it. I'm not stupid, so I simply get up and make plans to leave. He then tells me I'm right and that he's sorry. Still I'm pissed that he tried to play it off at first. He has apologized. I don't know if I'm overreacting and being insecure. The timing is just off, and this hasn't happened before. I've never as much as peeked at their conversations but there's an overwhelming urge right now for me.

UPDATE: Told Guys GF he was cheating on her with me,"I Facebook messaged the guys girlfriend who was being cheated on by a guy I was seeing (without my knowledge). 

I wrote:

Hi I was dating and having sex with your boyfriend for a few months now. We met in class and he told me he was single. I just found out he was with you, which he denied, but I think you have a right to know. I don't know how many people he has been with, but I am getting checked for STDS and I think you should too. Sorry that this is happening this way, but I wanted to let you know. 

I then provided text messages that showed his phone number and dates talking about sex together and him asking me not to tell her. 

The girl blocked me right away and the guy told me she didn't believe me and to leave her alone. He said he's not mad at me. Her friend message me, I gave more answers, but she told me I must be a ""fake account spending spam messages"". I don't get this because I provided pictures and have been responding.

This is making me feel worse he got away with it, but I've done all I can do. What's this girls issue? It still hurts I feel like he chose her over me. I don't know if I'm thinking they're incredibly dumb because I'm in the situation, but yeah. Was my message too vague?",relationship_advice
My (24M) gf (24F) is unusually buying new bras and panties,"Over the last two and half weeks my gf has bought close to 9 new pairs of lingerie. This is unusual because she bought some 7 new pairs somewhere at the beginning of April. Now I don't mind a girl buying new lingerie, but this is unusual - she had close to 40 new pairs of lingerie, a count which keeps on decreasing every other day. Now I take out trash every given day, and I've observed that she hasn't thrown her old lingerie in trash over past one week, while there's no trace of it anywhere in our apartment. And yet she is missing 4-5 pairs from our common closet. She seems to act pretty normal, there's no dent in her daily routine. But it boggles me why she is on this lingerie shopping spree? It's not like she is amassing a stockpile of lingerie, her lingerie count is somewhat unchanged from the time before this madness. I couldn't find trace of her old lingerie. Am I being paranoid? Am I missing something here feminine that's otherwise normal? Should I ask her anything about it?

TL;DR GF buying new lingerie every few days, while leaving no trace where she threw her old ones.

**UPDATE**: I might ask her while we drive down to the train station in next 30 minutes. Will keep you guys posted.

**UPDATE 2**: Alright I chatted with her while driving. I started off by asking her directly as u/fightmaxmaster suggested. She said something like she hasn't been feeling good about her underwear fitting (old and new) while at work. So she has taken a new vow - if she finds any underwear incredibly uncomfortable, she will throw it off immediately. I asked her I haven't noticed any in our trash (maintaining my casual tone) and she said since since we spend most our daytime at work she disposes it off in her workplace bin and carries pair of change underwear, like most women do. I even said to her jokingly ""Oh, I was worried you were seelling your undies on eBay or something"" (just to get some kind of an answer) and she ewwed my remark. **Do women do that at work or get rid off their old undies when they find it uncomfortable like this?** I could really use your insight on this. Tbh, we moved together at the beginning of this year and this is the first time I've moved in with a girl, in a relationship. I don't know what else I could do, since she has made it clear she drops it off in work trash and has shown no intention/fetish to sell it online. But overall, I tried to make this conversation as 'just out of curiosity' as I could.

**UPDATE 3**: This is way too overwhelming. I am heading back home and taking a day off. I know I might be overreacting but somehow it just doesn't sound right, the conversation we had an hour ago. Might talk to her again during her lunch break.

**UPDATE 4**: Seriously guys, thank you!! I have been glued to my phone all morning along, except driving back home. It took me a lot of self-convincing to gather clues for a possibility that my gf might be selling it online. Back at home, we have place to archive open mails, receipts, bills and other important documents except for our social and other personal items. There were 6 receipts in total, 2 from Victoria's Secret and 3 from Target and 1 from Macy's. Against my rough counting, she had amassed some 28-30 pairs of new lingerie, including the one at the beginning of April. Two of these receipts had Karen's name on it (my gf's elder sister), I believe Karen has some kind of rewards card from VS. That itself accounts for 40% of her new purchases. Till now I thought she had probably purchased 15 pairs, give or take. I don't wanna invade her privacy by sneaking her bank statements, because that would be a bit over the line. I cannot believe that she spent $1100+ on lingerie over past 45 days. That by itself is so fucking unusual. It's also odd that she hasn't paid using our RED card at Target (we have Target app on our phones). I am calling my brother over to get some clarity. I don't know if it would be right to login to her laptop and see her browsing history to confirm if she's selling her underwear online. I am just numbed atm.

**UPDATE 5**: I spoke to my brother and saw some of your comments. I've decided to confront her in-person when she's back home. I don't wanna take any chances or let any form of miscommunication trigger chain reactions for questions that might be unwarranted to her.

**UPDATE 6**: You know you have one of those days when all the hell breaks loose and this was one for me. I skipped lunch break phone call in hopes I can talk to my gf when she gets back home. Spoke to Karen and her mom in the meantime to ensure if she isn't in some kind of financial mess or other kind of trouble. But it takes one fucking truth to destroy it all. You guys, my gf saw this post at work and she immediately knew it was me posting it here. I didn't realize this, leaving rest of her day off. Some 4 hours ago my gf confessed that she was sleeping with some guy she met at her work gym. Since the beginning of March. Fuck me. 

She met this guy at her work gym some 8 months ago. This guy is not even from her workplace, he works at this other startup, in a different building of this corporate park. She said things got all heated up late February after one afternoon. I fucking though she stopped going to gym owing to her hectic schedule after her promotion late November. But there she was, going to gym all along. From the day she started sleeping with this guy, she told her coworkers she has switched gyms across the street. I haven't even cared to ask where they did it. The missing underwear: this is so messed up. Sick. She had this realization midway in March that this was wrong. I don't know why I never saw this side of her but she began buying new underwear and throwing it off **AS SOME FUCKING GUILT RITUAL**. She said she couldn't get off that guilt of wearing the same underwear in bed with me as she worn hours earlier sleeping with that mf. Do you know how disgusting that feels? Who fucking does this - throw underwear because you want tp dust off guilt from having it worn during sex with a guy you've met and barely known? I was stand still, but I held up for the moment. She says she was confused and that she has backed away from this guy's advances since past one week. I don't believe any word of it. In fact I don't think I wanna believe what she's said. Also, the ""tossing her underwear at workplace"" was an excuse - yes, because back then I was driving and she didn't know how to react or what to say, so she made that excuse up. And here I was worrying whole day what it could be.

I later called Karen because we were both emotionally drained. I didn't even wait a bit after she arrived. Even Karen was shocked by the ramble. She later called me, because I had already left them in our apartment. It took me a while to get my thinking right and call my brother. I'll be crashing at his house for now. 

Honestly I don't even wanna see her face ever. How can someone lie so perfectly? How can someone be so cold that they show no emotional change or discomfort when sleeping with two people??? WTF - she slept with me hours after she slept with that idiot? And throwing underwear was her means to get over that guilt. I don't understand her anymore. When she said it was all carnal, I didn't even know she believed in notion of sleeping around with people for physical needs. She said she still loves me and this was just something that made her feel good. I don't even know what to interpret of that. Honestly I think my thoughts are all over the place. But thank you - I don't know if I could have known about this if it wasn't for this post. It was after dinner did I realize that was trending on this sub, and this post made her take the mid-day train back home. I have so many questions. Part of me wants to see her again just to make sure she is alright. Part of me doesn't want to see her ever again. I have so many questions but I just avoided her by walking downstairs in no time. I had to ask my brother and his wife to pick some stuff off from home. Shit this is all messed up.

**UPDATE 7**: Final update [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmxx68/update_24m_24f_i_owe_this_sub_a_lot/). AND thank you guys! This sub is frickin awesome.",relationship_advice
I (22F) woke up in the middle of the night to find my best friend (22F) sleeping with my boyfriend (24M) in the living room,"Throw away account for obvious reasons, and sorry for any formatting, I'm on a mobile.  

I don't even know where to begin, my head is such a mess right now.. So my boyfriend ""john"" and I have been dating for three years and at the beggining, it was the most romantic love story. I met him when I was 18 and starting dweating him when I was 19 and qt more I dated him, the more I saw a future with him. 

He would always put time and effort into me, take care of me and go an extra mile to put a smile on my face. But things have changed since then to say the least, after about 1.5 years of dating. It started with little things, like him not wanting to kiss me as much or finding excuses to not hang out. We went from seeing each other every day to only hanging out maybe once or twice a week for two hours. I know he's got his own life and I'm not trying to control him, but I wish he would make me feel a little more special and maybe make an extra effort to see me. 

I should probably also mention that I suffer from depression and a low self esteem, and it's probably really hard on John when I'm in a bad state. I try not to but sometimes I just can't help feeling so alone and in the dark. 

So anyways, we were celebrating my bestfriend's  (ex-bestfriend now?) birthday at my house last night with a bunch of friends (maybe about 20) and there was a fair bit of drinking. The reason she couldn't have the party at her house was because she shares her place with room mates, which was fine because I had no problem throwing her party at mine, as long as she helped clean the house up in the morning. 

The night went alright, but I did I notice John and ""Sarah"" (the best friend) we're getting a little too close like him grabbing her from behind and spinning her around. But I just brushed it off because I never noticed anything before and we are all bestfriends. 

So after around midnight, everyone has left and John, Sarah and I are just chilling in the longueroom laughing about our night together. And when it was ready for bed, I set up a mattress in the longueroom for Sarah and John told me he'd be in our bed soon. So I went to bed and crashed alone. And maybe after a few hours I woke up in the middle of the night desperately needing to pee. Now I don't have a bathroom connected to my room, it's down the hall. So I slowly get up and realise John isn't in our bed?? So I went to walk down the hall when I start to hear like moaning noises and I'm like wtf and I peek my head down the hall to see John and Sarah having sex. I know I should of confronted them right there and then but I couldn't, I just sneaked back into bed and cried silently. I didn't even have a chance to pee. 

So now it's morning, Johns snuck back into our bed and is acting like nothing's happened. I've lost a long life bestfriend and a boyfriend I put three YEARS into you. I don't even know how to confront them, I'm not even sure if I can confirm what I had seen because we were all drinking, it's driving my insanity crazy. But the real kicker is that John and I haven't slept together in months, but he can sleep with her. I just feel so low. 

How can I comfort them and even begin to process this? I don't want to lose John, we have our ups and downs but he's everything to me :((( if everyone has ever been in this situation and has any advice, feel free to let me know, just don't be too brutal. I think I already know what I have to do..






EDIT 1: I used the excuse that I had to text my mother ""what day were hanging out today"" (I don't have credit and John knows that, so he didn't suspect anything) and I went through his phone and the evidence was pretty damming, they've been sleeping together for a while.. I took screenshots of their conversations and sent it to my phone in case he tried to deny it.

After all that, I confronted him when Sarah left, it was so hard to even get the words out. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HE DENIED IT!! He told me that he loves me more than anything and would never do that, and that I should know that and to stop accusing him of such silly non-sense. That's when I told him I've seen all of his and Sarah's messages.. At first he still kept denying it saying ""someone's hacked his accounts"" and he doesn't know what I'm talking about, but eventually he broke down crying saying he loves me and doesn't wanna lose me, but couldn't feel the spark anymore and it was the biggest mistake of his life. He wants to make this work and push past this.. Well maybe you should of tried instead of sleeping with my best friend? 

So I told him to leave, and of course he doesn't ""know"" where his car keys are and asks if it's okay to stay for a few hours when his best friend Mark gets off work so he can pick him up. It was so difficult to say no but I did, I just wanted to be alone. I don't even know who he is anymore! He ended up ""finding"" his car keys and he's been calling and messaging me ever since.

As for Sarah, I got a message from her saying this (I'm assuming John gave HER the heads up): ""I can't even explain how sorry I am [my name], I never wanted to hurt you and I don't know how this happened, but something grew between ""John"" and I and I can't deny that what we have is so intensely strong and real. I hope we can work for this and I hope you can someday come to become okay with me and ""John"" being a couple. I wish you the best of luck and when your ready, please message me. Lots of love x""
SO I DONT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE! John is telling me he wants to work through this while Sarah is saying their a couple. I'm now going to be ending it with John and my mum is gonna come meet with me and stay for a few days to make sure I'm Okay. 

Thanks for all the advice reddit :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT 2: First of all I would like to thank everyone for yours words of advice and support, I really appreciate in a time like this. 

Some of you guys suggested that I send the messages that John sent me to Sarah. Me and my mum talked about it and how I might come off as spiteful and jealous, but I thought screw it. I don't owe you guys the time of day or respect, so I sent them to her. At first she didn't respond and ignored it, but then replied asking to meet up and discuss this. Shes now playing the victim saying she had no idea that John still wanted to pursue me and that we've both been played. Pftttt 

I have no idea if Sarah messaged John or what came of those messages. I honestly want nothing to do with them anymore. My plan is to pack up all johns shit and leave it out the front outside, then message him he can collect it WHILE I'm at work. He's got three days to get it until I donate it to a charity. I also then blocked his number and every social media account, so he can no longer contact me. I've also removed his name from any shared responsibilities/accounts we have together and any mail of his that is sent to my address, will be returned to sender because I'm not putting up with any more of his shit. 

As for Sarah, I have no intention of keeping that snake as a bestfriend. But unfortunately we travel in the same friend group, so I'll just have to avoid any future gatherings that she's participating in. Luckily I have friends that love me and will help me move through this.

Thank you again for your support! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


EDIT 3: He picked up his stuff, loaded it into his car and then SHOWED UP TO MY DOOR! I told him to pick it up during my work hours but of course he didn't have the decency to give me fucking that!! I'm so angry! 

Mum said that he tried to walk through the door and she told him to get lost and slammed the door in his face. I could hear him calling my name and it made me cry a little harder but I just wish if I could of have the scarification of watching him have the door slammed in his face! Just arghhhh, what a peice of shit

"[UPDATE] I [34m] recently found out that my S/O [32f] had sex with another guy immediately before our first date. This made me feel really upset, and I can't quite pinpoint what I should do.","Hello everyone! Here was my previous post:

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9fp53u/i_34m_recently_found_out_that_my_so_32f_had_sex/

So, it has been about two weeks since I learned about what happened before our first date. She and another man had sex immediately before I picked her up, and something about it irked me.

While the last post was full of people just in it to mock me, a few users did post very helpful advice. Another user sent me some private messages telling me how I can get over the issue.

One thing that really resounded true with me was that I was strongly thinking about how *I* felt about the situation, but not about how *she* felt. There wasn't exactly a wedding ring on her finger when she had sex with the other man. At no point in time do I have claim over her body and her choices, especially not when we weren't even in a committed relationship yet.

I talked with her about the issue and how she felt about it, and at first she was hesitant, but eventually she opened up and told me that she was looking for some sort of connection. To be honest I felt really sad that she hadn't given me a chance to fill that role for her (not even on a physical but emotional level) before calling some guy from Tinder over, but I feel like I understand her better now. More than anything, I realized the pressing need for me to come to terms with my own issues, and the social conditioning I've had that made me borderline shame her for having sex. If she felt good, and if he felt good about the encounter, calling myself a victim for it is ridiculous and entitled.

Right now I'm looking through therapists in my area to see if I can't take a more proactive approach to my personal issues.

Thank you all for the helpful advice, even those of you who laughed at me. For anyone who cares, I'm working through it and things are looking up!

**tl;dr: I've decided to work on myself instead of concentrating so much on my S/O's behavior before we were even committed.**",relationship_advice
"Fiancée [27/F] went ""too far"" at bachelorette party. I [28/M] am ready to call it off. People are telling me not to due to ""extenuating circumstances"" (Progress from Friday)","I originally posted this on /r/relationships but it got removed.

&#x200B;

I'm losing my mind. I posted Friday about what happened previously. I will include the original content for people to read below. I need perspective and people's opinion on where to go from here. The whole wedding is fractured.

&#x200B;

After I posted my thread, I got a lot of great advice and suggestions. At around 5-something, I was hungry and went out to grab some dinner and come home. I got home and my future FIL was in the parking lot. He saw me and asked to talk. He brought a cigar and beer so we chatted. He had no idea what happened and wanted to hear it from me. I told him the whole thing but refused to show him pictures. By this point I had a lot of the photos and they were pretty rough. My FIL drank a beer, left me the rest and I ate dinner and smoked. He said he'd call later, so I turned my phone on. I had dozens and dozens of calls, maybe 100+ texts and WhatsApp messages, FB messages and emails. I sifted through them through dinner and finally got an email from my future FIL. Short and to the point. His daughter is sorry, she's a horrible mess and is going to stay with him. He's disappointed in her, her friends and this situation, to take time but to please consider forgiving her. 

&#x200B;

Right around 10 two of the Bride's Maids show up. They're knocking at the door and they want to talk. I let them in and we chat. They immediately start pointing the finger at the Maid of Honor, that she was the person that planned this and that they thought they were going to just have a ""girls night out."" The toplessness was a joke on the ""girls out"" and they didn't know that a stripper was coming. They had apparently had something to eat, drank a ton, went to one of the other bride's maids house and were getting changed to go to a club and were all wasted. They confirmed that my fiancée was by far the drunkest and both confirmed that the stripper did indeed touch her below the belt. Fiancée was obliterated drunk and did verbally stop him after he touched her *there*. After that, people got uncomfortable (the stripper was totally naked.....) and they left. My fiancée sobered up somewhat after water and some time between drinks and then immediately began boozing again at the bar/club which is when they plunked her in a chair. 

&#x200B;

The bride's maids left at around 11 and I thanked them for telling me the truth. They felt that my fiancée had been too drunk to do much and that they were all surprised the stripper showed up. They all said it was the Maid of Honor who organized this and asked me to just talk with my fiancée. I wasn't in the mood but texted her not to engage my parents, I didn't want them involved with this and that she should keep them out of it and we'd talk. That opened the gates and she texted me on/off most of the night. I finally agreed to meet her the next morning. It was awkward, neither of us knew exactly what to say. She was crying and wanted a hug. 

&#x200B;

We sat down and she basically apologized for everything, took responsibility and said that she was sorry for what happened. She agreed that she was too drunk, should have excused herself or stopped drinking and didn't know a stripper would be coming. She said that everyone was topless and she explained that there was some dancing, the stripper did his show and then pushed her on the bed and inserted her finger. She said no, he quickly removed it and no one knew what to do. MOH danced with him a bit more, then their time was up and he left. I asked about the photos and MOH and another bride's maid took photos, the MOH took the finger sniffing photo. I asked who else has photos of the event and she doesn't know but hopes MOH doesn't ""use them"" for any sort of revenge. 

&#x200B;

I told her I understood but was hurt and horrified. She indicated that she talked to her father and then her MoH who basically turned on fiancée and said she did her a favor, etc. They aren't talking and as a gesture, fiancée will remove her from the wedding and we'll just have an off-balance of people in the wedding party. She hadn't slept so after a while she went to go sleep and I went and ran errands. 

&#x200B;

We basically kept to ourselves on Saturday. On Sunday she made me breakfast and crawled into bed with me. I had to be clear that I'm still really upset and told her that I'm hurt, I'm disappointed, I'm not ""just over it."" She said she understood but wouldn't let this ""come between us."" 

&#x200B;

I'm starting to feel bad that I'm not somehow over it and I'm not sure if I should just drop this whole thing. In the past, my fiancée has been a solid person, she's not the kind to get drunk or would have ever done something like this. I have a business trip coming up shortly that she is slated to travel with me for. She's packing her bags and looking to go. I'm not sure what to do. To recap:

&#x200B;

1. She's completely and unreservedly apologized
2. She is removing the Maid of Honor from the wedding 
3. Her friends and family think this indiscretion is a one-off and to work through it 
4. She should still come on the business trip I'm going to.

&#x200B;

I need perspective. I feel like a whirlwind has knocked me back and I'm not sure what to do.

The orginal post: 

&#x200B;

I've been with my fiancée for going on 4 years. We got engaged a little over a year ago and were going to put a rush on the wedding because her mother was sick. Her mom had smoked for a long time, quit, picked it back up, and then developed cancer. To look at her mom, you'd never suspect she was a smoker, but had picked up the habit. Her mother grew too ill for a wedding so the idea of putting one together quickly faded and instead a couple of months ago, she passed. My fiancée was devastated to lose her mom at such a young age. I offered to postpone the wedding but she really wanted to move forward with it and took to planning.

We agreed that we weren't too interested in bachelor/bachelorette parties and instead decided we'd do something low key. Her Maid of Honor approached me about doing something more ""substantive"" for fiancée as she lost her mom not too long ago. I thought it was a good idea. I arranged for dinner/drinks and fun with my groomsmen. The Best Man (my brother) and my best friend booked a steakhouse and then arranged for drinks at a nice place afterwards. They bought me a nice cigar for the lounge and we had a tremendous time.

Fiancée was texting me and then her phone died. She was out incredibly late – her friends said they packed it in around 5 AM and then slept most of the morning and hate a late lunch rather than brunch. When she got home she was still hungover and basically laid in bed and drank Gatorade instead of doing anything. The Saturday and Sunday were pretty much a write-off. She was that hungover. I asked her about it and she kept saying she pretty much has no recollection after a certain point. Her friends said something similar, that she was so obliterated after like 3 AM that they carried her to a friend's brother's bar where they hung out while my fiancée sipped booze while splayed in a chair.

Things were fine until last night when she asked me to find something on her phone. I noticed a message come through saying my name, so yes, I snooped. It said ""I also hope \[my real name\] doesn't find out."" I scroll up and it's a nightmare. This afternoon, my fiancée texts her Maid of Honor saying that she hasn't been that drunk ""in a long time"" and her friend follows up with ""I know"" and a series of photos – my wife and her friends in a room – most of the women are topless, including my fiancée, and there's a stripper. Fiancée responds ""oh god. Can we not."" And another photo follows with the *stripper kissing her neck* while her friends are topless, holding booze and obviously acting poorly. Fiancee texts ""I feel bad because \[my real name\] had such a tame night. He's such a good boy. I hope he doesn't find out."" That's when MoH responds: ""I also hope \[my real name\] doesn't find out"" and by this point has added ""he'd leave you."" During their night out, someone must have used her phone to take photos to commemorate her little dalliance, because there must have been another half dozen photos on her phone. The worst being what looks like my topless fiancée laying on the bed with her friends around her and a naked stripper smelling his finger. I was horrified.

I didn't know what to do and didn't want to come out and say I snooped so I tried to get her to talk about the evening. I told her about our evening. She deflected, said she was drunk, and that she never needs to be drunk again and then says something how she's not at all jealous of her single friends and can't wait to get married. We're getting married ***in four weeks***. I couldn't take it and told her I knew. She freaked out and at first got mad that I snooped but then realized the gravity of the situation. She began to apologize and hid behind being drunk. I didn't accept that and she started crying. I went to another room to cool off and I guess she texted her friend because I received a flurry of texts telling me that it was a mistake and nothing happened. After a few hours of arguing, fiancée tells me that they went to someone's house where they all got obliterated and a stripped arrived. They decided to take their tops off and have fun. The stripper did his thing and kissed my fiancée's neck and chest and attempted to touch her genitals but she stopped him. They tipped him and he left. I didn't handle it well and basically said that it didn't really matter at the end of the day and that the wedding was off. She looked stunned. I threw some clothes into a bag and told her to leave. To my surprise she left.  Her Maid of Honor texted me that I'm an asshole and I replied asking how much of the money I contributed towards their night went to a stripper putting the moves on my fiancée? I haven't heard from her since.

I took the day off work and had to turn my phone off. My fiancée has texted evert 3 or 4 minutes. Her father called/texted and then sent me a long email. I checked my phone again about 6 minutes ago and it's non-stop texts from a bunch of people. No one on my side of the family knows. My fiancée is saying she'll do anything, she wants to come home, she's sorry. Her father texted me again to please call him and her friends added me to a WhatsApp group that basically outlines the whole night, their indiscretion and is telling me that she's sorry/they're sorry that she was too drunk and that I'm an asshole for not talking to them.

I know I eventually have to say something. I don't know what to say or to whom. I don't even know how to handle this. Not in a million years would I have EVER thought my fiancée would do something like this. She's the most stable, earnest, nice and straightforward person ever. I don't understand it. I don't know what to do here.",relationship_advice
"I (f 26) told my husband (m 29) he was scaring me during an argument, and now he's very distant from me.","Two nights ago, we were fighting. My husband had not been in the best mood all day anyway, he was very stressed from work and tired. So it escalated fast. I felt like he was taking out all his feelings on me. He was yelling at me, insulting me. All I wanted was to have some peace and go to sleep. So I got up and started to walk away. He grabbed me by my arm so I couldn't and said ""don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you"". His grip was so painful and he just made me feel so small. I told him ""please you're scaring me"". As soon as I said that, he let go of my arm. He said, ""why are you scared?"". I couldn't say anything, I just started to tear up. He pulled me into him and I cried into his chest. He told me it's alright and I have nothing to be afraid of. He carried me back to bed, but he didn't sleep in our bedroom. Which felt weird. He didn't even say goodbye to me before he left for work in the morning but he left me flowers and the attached note said ""I'm sorry"". When he came home from work and ever since, he's just been so distant. Not cruel or anything, just distant. He'll kiss me but only on the cheek or forehead. He doesn't want to talk to me. He doesn't want to have sex. I don't understand. It wasn't my intention to make him feel badly if I did. How can I talk to him? I think he is just upset with himself. But I don't want him to be. I don't know what to do.",relationship_advice
Boyfriend's (21M) best friend (20F) hates me (25F) and wants us to break up.,"I seriously can't do this anymore. This is half like a vent and half a cry for help. I feel like I'm going fucking insane but I don't know what to do. 

I've been with my bf for almost one year. We live together. Things are going really well, this is kinda his first real, serious relationship so we had some issues at first, but we communicate a lot and he's a great guy. Definitely the best relationship I've been in so far, outside of one thing and that's his best friend. I don't want to be controlling. He can have female friends, it's absolutely no problem. He had issues with a jealous and manipulative girlfriend (didn't last long hence why I said first serious relationship), so I don't want to be ""that girlfriend"" if that makes sense. 

I met his friend after a month iirc. When we first met she was very sweet, kind and incredibly bubbly. As soon as my bf left the room, she looked at me like I shit in her cereal. She started barraging me with questions who I was, why I got with my bf and a bunch of other stuff. It was like an interrogation and she kept cutting me off. When my bf got back, she went back to the girl I met. I was so shocked, I didn't believe what had just happened. Every single time we've been alone together since, she has been a total BITCH to me. She's never obvious about it in front of my bf, it's never enough to call her out. When she's with my bf she hovers around him, touches him or tries to be as close as possible. My boyfriend thank god tells me everything. Until a few months ago they regularly gave each other massages.. He stopped it immediately when he saw my reaction.. Friend keeps bringing it up amongst other stuff like ""remember when we used to XXX"". She has no boundaries, she will cuddle up to him and I can't get mad because I'll look like a bitch myself. Today she came over for dinner, and she crossed yet again another line and I'm done with it.

Bf was prepping dinner and she came up to him and hugged him from behind and KISSED his neck AND cheek. She was wearing a super low cut top and her tit 'accidentally' fell out of her shirt. Later she showed her new swimming wear to us (????) and I could have killed her right there. I've told my bf about my concerns and he understands and listens, but he has known this girl literally since birth. I don't want to ask him to cut her off completely. He always asks if it's okay first to hang out or do something with her, but I almost need to throw up when I think what she's like when they're one on one. 

I'm so lost. I'm afraid. It's clear that she's into him (why in gods name did she never tell him this?) and she's told me it's only a matter of time until he dumps me.. It doesn't help that she's way prettier, younger and more adventurous as I am.. It would be an upgrade for him.. But he has never seen her act out to me because she is very careful about it. I've thought about approaching her directly but I don't see it going well.. Sorry for my English.  Any suggestions are welcome..",relationship_advice
[35/m] My brother [37/m] sent my daughter [13/f] sexual innuendoe text messages more than once,"This started ~ a month ago but some history is needed for context.
My brother was in a car accident ~20 years ago and sustained a TBI (traumatic brain injury) he has low iq, short term memory issues however he lives by himself alone, drives and has a full time job. His mentality is of a hormone raging 18 year old boy.

In the past year my brother managed to total his car and was in 2 more minor accidents in his new car. 

May of this year my brother was texting me several times asking me if he could take my oldest daughter [13/f] to see a movie and he would drive them. I avoided the question and dodged it for a while since I did not want to come out and tell him. I was not comfortable with him driving our kids around in his car.  I mentioned this to our mother who told me to be honest with him. I finally got around to having a conversation with him about taking our daughter to a movie and I informed him I was not comfortable but if they wanted to go I would drop them off and pick them up. He seemed angry at the time when I told him this. I told my mother about this and she told me I talked to him and hes not mad at all and I told her that wasn't the vibe I got from him.

Few Weeks ago I get a call and text from my wife while at work and its screen shots from my daughters cell phone with conversations with my brother. 

1. 1st screen shot is my brother asking my daughter if she wants to go the movies with him, daughter says did you ask my dad/mom and hes like yeah but they said no do you want to ask again.

2. 

Brother - what are doing?

Daughter - Babysitting.

Brother-  Oh OK

Brother -  Do you want to babysit me?

Brother - I'll Be A Good Boy

Daughter - Ok, I gotta go bye


3.He sends her a picture of luke bryan with the follow text
I wanna feel your heart go tick tock
While the rain from your hair drip drops
Park down in the middle of nowhere
There's a place I can get up against your lips
That's where I gotta be with you looking like this
Let's get lost somewhere, anywhere we ain't gotta hold back
If we're gonna go out baby, let's go out like that

Daughter does not respond and tells wife about the text messages. who then calls / text me at work. Im furious and raging at this point but I have a flight in the morning for work and will be gone the rest of the week. 

Last Week,I finally text my brother and ask him to stop so we can talk. I had to calm down and process everything so I wouldn't loose my temper. I get my step mom to grab all the kids and take them out for ice cream. So my biological dad, myself and my wife sit my brother down and we talk about the texts, which he said one was a joke but they other me might of sent but didn't read but cant remember. I told him his behavior makes him look like pedophile, I no longer trust him etc. Ask him if needed help, if he was attracted to younger girls, he said no but I don't truly believe him at this point. I told he was no longer welcome to stop by with out an invite, he will never be alone with any of our kids. I changed our garage door code which he had. Not sure how much of relationship I can have with my brother moving forward. I feel so mentally lost right now",relationship_advice
"My gf, 29 hates my young kids and they are starting to know it and it is affecting them","**Edit - I kicked her out this morning. I told her that I was done with how she was treating my kids, and how I shouldn't have to apologize for having them around. She gave me crocodile tears, begging for a second chance, and that she ""really loved"" the kids but I was firm and she left. The kids are still sleeping but I can't wait until they wake up and tell them the wicked witch is gone. But thank you reddit, for the support, as well as the advice that I HAD to leave her. I knew the relationship was never going to work out I should have realized it long ago to leave her but I can only move forward.**

I am 31M, and I have three young kids. E is 7, and twins L and K are 5. Their mom died just a few months in a car accident (damn drunk driver, long story short) after the twins were born.
Recently, I started dating R. We fell head over heals with each other but she was PISSED when she found out I had kids. I explained the situation to her, and she cut a bit of slack after that. However, she still complains whenever I have to put my kids needs in front to her wants.
This evening, I was helping E with her summer reading assignment at the kitchen table, and R wanted to watch this movie with me, and I told her to wait a few. That is when she screamed, ""We can never have a real relationship because of your damm kids needing shit all of the time!"" 
The thing is, we do have a relationship like anyone else does. Sure, I have to put my kids first every now and then, but I think that is how any relationship with kids would work, and ours is no exception.
Tonight, as I said good night to the kids, E asked me why I would date R if she hated her and her sisters. My heart crushed into a billion pieces at that moment. 
This isn't the first time something such as that occurred. The twins had forgotten to put their orange peels in the trash and R screamed at me for being too permissive apparently. I heard K run off into a corner, silently crying to herself, ""My daddy is good, why is she [R] yelling at him??"" 
I am considering leaving R for the sake of how she treats my kids, and have asked her how she would feel if an adult treated her kids the way she does. The thing is, she has her own depression and anger issues and her family barely speaks to her anymore due to her behavior towards family members, similar to how she treats my kids.
I am at a crossroad right now. R is asleep on the couch after finishing the movie, and I am currently in the bedroom writing this with tears in my eyes. My kids have been through so much in their young lives so far, and it kills me that they know how R feels about them. I know what the long term affects can be. However, R has told me quality time with me is her only source of happiness at this point. 
I don't know what to do, any advice will help at this point.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out? [UPDATE]","Okay so I listened to everyone who commented, and discussed all of it with the rest of my friends. 

Thank you all for the advice. 

We were all upstairs around a table and some chairs / sofa. We called him upstairs, and I think he knew what was coming because he seemed already pissed off. 

I started off by explaining by trying to calmly explain the situation with him having to pay, but then was immediately cut off by someone saying ""Yo you have to pay us £250 for the Villa."" Obviously he got pissed at this. 

We were arguing / discussing / whatever it was non - stop for well over half an hour. It was kinda heated not gonna lie. 

He handled it really well, and I admit it was really sly of us to all sort of ""gang up"" on him, because I've been in that situation before and it feels really bad. So I tried to keep everything calm. 

Basically there was a bit more to the story, since the 2 people organising this trip to Spain, basically didn't fill the rest of us in on some essential stuff. 

Like for example, the amount Mark got refunded was only £100, whereas the price of the Villa was £250. But the thing is, the 2 people organising it apparently ""agreed"" that it's fine for him to stay, and this is where the confusion comes in, because they say they didn't. Essentially, when we were still planning the holiday, Mark apparently already asked these 2 people if it's okay for him to cancel the apartment and come in our villa, and they said yes but none of them set prices and shit straight from the start. 

Mark's point is, he's taking Harry's spot, so why should he pay, since, if he wasn't there, the refundable deposit would go to Harry either way? 

This is probably confusing and it's hard to explain since it was a very lengthy and heated engagement so I'm not sure how to explain absolutely everything, so that's the jist of it. 

Harry, who cancelled, was going to get all of the refundable deposit. We asked Mark to pay for staying in the villa, and he said no. 

We asked him in many different ways, and he raised some valid points, but still said No. Also, he has thousands of pounds, so paying that wasn't the problem. 

He just didn't want to pay. 

So, we listened to all of you, and told him he can't sleep in the villa if he's not paying because it's not fair on everyone else. He was pissed, and we even had to ring some of our friends back home to clear up some more shit that was there due to poor organising and lack of communication. 

So, I suggested instead of £250 he pay £145, which is how much it would cost to stay in the villa for the remainder of the holiday. The reason I said this is because we did bring it up with him 3 days into the holiday, so it's unfair of us to expect him to pay the full amount. 

He didn't want to pay it. Eventually, and I mean eventually, we decided that he's going to stay in the apartment that those 2 other people rented out that is near our Villa. He will pay them for staying in the apartment, as it's cheaper than our Villa, only around £100. 

Everything is awkward as fuck and I'm fearing that the holiday may be ruined because of this. I felt so bad after for all of us ""ganging up"" on him, because that's pretty much what it was. I've been on the other side, and I know how it feels like. 

So, I offered to pay the £45 for him, and he only pays £100. At this point he was packing his suitcase and everything so he still declined and said he didn't want to stay with people who didn't want him there anyway. 

We all tried to stress how it's not personal, and we aren't doing it on purpose. I felt bad after so I went to him individually and just said sorry essentially for all of us ganging up on him, and we aren't doing it just for the sake of it. 

So he packed, and he's staying elsewhere, like you guys said he should. So thank you. 

In the meantime we just went to the beach to try kill the tension and any awkwardness between us, it's working slowly but surely. 

Thanks again and happy holidays to everyone :)",relationship_advice
I (27M) am leaving my gf (25F) because she's been trying to have an affair,"This is hard. We've been together for nearly 8 years. We built a life together. 

So, there's so much to this but basically I did that thing that everyone in a relationship should be wary of. I looked through her phone. And I found messages upon messages from a mutual friend who lives out of state now that were concerning. Initially I was gonna leave right then and there but I wanted to try to talk to her. So I gave her almost 3 chances to own up to it. The first time I was really vague and just asked if there was someone else. She flat out denied. I thought I was prepared for her to deny but turns out I wasn't. Then the other times I got more and more pointed. Finally she admitted that the guy had messaged her and flirted with her but we knew he was that way and while she didn't tell him to ""fuck off"" she wasn't into it. 

Now I didn't see any messages from her at the beginning that showed she was exactly complicit in it. So while I didn't believe her I tried to give her a chance. I know it's stupid but we've been together for so long and we built a life together.

But then I dug again. And there it was. All of it. And worst she took the time to insult me to him. That hurts. So fucking much that hurts. I know my faults and I know what I could've worked on in this relationship but I really tried. Everyday I tried. But for her to tell someone else things about me like that, I can't help but feel broken. 

So, right now I'm waiting for her to wake up and leave for work. Then I'm packing what I can and heading to a friends place and....I don't know. I spent 8 years on this relationship and I'm gonna walk away from it. 

I wrote a note out on my phone that I'm gonna write up for her after she leaves. It says everything I can think to say. I mulled over what to say nonstop. Somewhat satisfyingly I'm gonna tell her how she did this. To know that and remember that. And that if at any point she thinks we can ok that she fucked this and hurt me so much. 

I'm scared I'm lost and so much so I don't want to have to do this. 

But I have to and I know ultimately it's going to get better. But also fuck all of this. 

Edit 1: she's up now and getting ready for work. She tried to kiss me and apologized about tossing and turning all night and she knew it kept me up. 

I seem to be getting a lot of push back on the letter. When she leaves I'm gonna pack and I'll mull it over again. But I'll say this, if I decide to write and it ends up being a mistake then so be it. It felt nice to at least draft it out on my phone. Made things more real so I can convince myself more that I have to leave. 

Edit 2 (8:30 AM) she just left for work. I'm going to shower and truthfully let out a nice cry. Then pack my stuff. Lots of people are saying to straight ghost her and lots are saying a short and to the point note instead of letter. I'm gonna contemplate that in the shower. 

She kept saying ""I love you"" and I was reluctant to say it back. She said it 3 times and I kind of grumbled it out once. I'm certain once she reaches work she'll text me about that. 

I'm not going to respond to her while she's at work. She won't be home till probably 8 tonight. 

I just realized I should time stamp the edits maybe(?) I don't know 

Edit 3 (8:54) I'm packing up now. Cats seem to know something is up because they won't leave me alone. Honestly breaks my heart. 

I've been mulling the letter over. I reread it a few times. And I've decided on a short note just laying out that I know and I'm leaving. Essentially something like: 

""I left. I know about you and him [insert what I read and saw]. I'm so utterly disappointed in you. I won't be answering my phone and I wish for you not to contact me. At some point we'll get together to discuss logistics.""

Also, I am reading everyone's comments. If I didn't reply I'm sorry. To the people that have commented about going through something similar, i am so so sorry you're going through this as well. I don't know what you'll be able to gleam from my situation but I hope something here in all of this helps y'all as well. 

Edit 4 (9:25 am) I'm pretty much packed with what I can get out right now. Obviously there's a lot more. I'm writing the note and then leaving. I'll need to find food after I drop off what I have. This may be the last update since she won't be off till later tonight. But I'll respond to y'all when I can. Gives me something to do. 

Edit 5 (10:42 AM) I'm at my friends place. She's giving me the lay of the land. People have been talking about taking the cat. Currently that's not an option. Friend has 3 and a dog. My cats are spoiled and hate anyone that isn't her and I. I'm not worried she'd do anything to them. If anything she's gonna want them around if she does get upset. Not that she deserves that but it is what it is 

Thank you everyone for the kind words and the advice. I'll respond to some of you again here soon. 

Someone asked me about my work. I work in equine care. It's actually really cool, I LOVE my job and I love being there. So once I start going back in a few days it'll be a really good distraction. 

In a bit I'm going to get food and maybe walk around downtown and goof off. 

Also, my friend reminded me she's going out of town next week for a week. So I'll have the place to myself. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. But hey she'll have someone to watch her animals while she's gone so there's that. 

I know I have a lot of figuring out to do. But I literally just left. 

Oh, and someone else mentioned they hope I find things to do to make myself happy. I had plans before all of this to go to ""the usual"" brewery with some friends tomorrow. Initially I was gonna call some of them and tell what's going on and I need space but thinking about it more it actually sounds like the perfect distraction.  

Edit 6 (1:45) Got food (banh mi and a mai tai if anyone was curious) and talked to a couple of friends. So I'm sorry I haven't been replying. It's gonna take a while to go through all the messages and comments but what I've seen so far I want to say for the umpteenth time thank you y'all. 

Edit 7 2:15 - Okay, this is my last update. Apparently I used a word that altright folks like to use but it was used to describe me so whatever. 

I'm still trying to go through all the comments but I saw some people had questions I'll do my best to address. 

The friend is...well a friend. I don't know what else to say on that. There's nothing there. A guy and a girl can be friends and that's it. If this is weird for you guys then I'm sorry? I mean I don't know if this is gonna be a straight move in. I'm still figuring things out. 

Some people have said I'm no better than her and 8 years and not being married was already a bad sign and etc. Well, I guess so? Like clearly this relationship isn't working out. Look what it lead to. If that's my fault or her fault or or fault or whatever it is the situation I'm in. 

And on the note of what it lead to, a lot of people asked me what exactly was said or done. I realize I kept it vague and I supposed it was cause I felt weird typing it out. But I don't mind telling you guys what I can. 

As far as I know she hasn't actually ""cheated"" ie fucked him. They messaged flirtatious things (calling eachother hot sexy etc) and their some pictures but no nudes. But the recent thing I found (and I'll touch on the going through the phone thing next) it was messages about wanting to fuck eachother. Straight up. That they missed a chance because of me. But, and this for me is the kicker, he apparently wants to make a [this is where that word was used] of me. And she seemed into it. They wanted to have sex and have me know they did. Which is why I don't think they have yet. 

On the going through the phone thing, I know it was dumb. I know what I did. I don't advocate. But it is how I found about all of this. I just had suspicions that something was going on with someone. So it did that for me. Would I tell the next person to go through their partners phone? I don't know. Probably not. I'd tell them if they find something it'll hurt cause this fucking hurts. And if they don't then they breached the trust and privacy of their SO for nothing and that in it of itself is a weird situation. 

I don't know folks. Does that help anyone? Should I elaborate more? ",relationship_advice
wife's son won't let me have any personal space,"Let me start out by saying I love him and he is great but goddamn I can't stand him sometimes. 

Today I woke up and the first thing I saw as I opened my eyes was his face directly in mine. He then started to yell until I got up and got him food. 

He follows me around the house, stands outside the bathroom and yells for attention, stands in front of the tv while I'm trying to watch, as soon as the tv goes on, without fail, plays under our bed and makes noise constantly, is always running around our house knocking things over, and then comes and rubs up against me while I am trying to clean up the messes he makes. 

A lot of the time he will try to run between my legs while I'm walking somewhere, then gets super upset when I inevitably kick him on accident.
*what were you expecting*

It's not that I don't like him, I love the guy but his constant neediness puts me off from ever playing with him or giving him any attention at all, because he is constantly in my face and never does anything on his own. When I go to bed he will walk across our pillows, he is always just, nearby. He won't let me hold him or sit in my lap but he will always sit next to me and just look at me and it makes me uncomfortable because he will stare at me for an entire hour sometimes. He is constantly bothering our pet gerbils by swiping at the glass and it makes them nervous.

He is extremely hyper at night and sometimes gets me up at 5am because he wants food. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I have tried brushing him, petting him, dragging yarn around for him to chase, eventually I just resort to dumping catnip on the floor so he eats and gets sleepy.

I am at the end of my rope and not sure what to do.

tldr: stepson won't let me live my life in peace and is constantly waking me up and following me *everywhere*

UPDATE: My [27M] best friend's [27M] girlfriend [40F] just called me and invited me over without my friend there,"So I just wanted to give an update and add some context to my last post.  I quickly wrote my last post because I was looking for answers before I arrived at the house.  The TL;DR of the update is that we had a pretty innocent conversation about life in general.

So like I said before, I've hung out with my best friend's girlfriend before but it's always been the three of us.  And shes called me or texted me before, but usually it's in the context of a group thing that me and my best friend are in the process of setting up.  So when I saw her name pop up on my phone as she called me, I knew that there weren't any plans (I just was with the both of them for Game 7 of the NHL playoffs), and my immediate thought was that something bad had happened to my friend and that's why she was calling me.  So when I answered the call, that was my mindset going in and I was kind of a 'deer in the headlights.'

When I answered she asked me if I had any plans for the evening, I told her I didn't.  She asked if I wanted to come over for some pizza and beer, and hang out.  I had just got home from work, and told her that I just needed to change and I could come over.  At this point I thought all three of us would be there, but that's when she told me that my friend was still at work and wouldn't be back till later.  So to those of you asking why I would even go over in the first place, I was already pot committed.

Now to those of you wondering, I did not text my friend that I was going over.  Here's the thing.  I've known him since I was 5, so 22 out of the 27 years I've lived I've been friends with this kid.  We grew up together and he is basically my brother.  I knew what my intentions were, and trusted that he would trust me.  Nonetheless, the girlfriend did let him know that I was coming over and so he texted me when I was on my way to his house.  He knew I was going to be there.  I also have a recording app on my phone that I had ready to use so I could turn it on if the conversation started going inappropriate, but I did not have to use it at all.

When I got there, all me and the girlfriend did was talk about life stuff until my friend came home.  I feel like if anything, this was just a little bonding time for the two of us and an opportunity to connect more.  My friend is an important person in both of our lives, so it makes sense to me that his girlfriend and I should also have a good, friendly relationship as well.

All in all, I think I just freaked out a little because it could definitely have been an awkward position if everyone's intentions weren't good.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] Ex [29F] who dumped me [26M] because she thought I cheated now wants to get back in touch,"Link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/at1pp1/ex_29f_who_dumped_me_26m_because_she_thought_i/

I decided to give my ex-girlfriend that one meet up, for her sake. I honestly wasn't expecting to gain anything myself from this. But I still remembered how much I cared for her, so I figured I could do this one thing and we could both move on with our lives. Meeting her in person though, that was a whole different thing. I don't know how to describe this feeling, but it was quite like anticipation, like when you're just expecting something to happen, and don't know if it's good or bad. Now that I look back on it, I know I was hoping for good. 

We talked a great deal when we met and ended up staying out for hours. A great deal of it was her sincerely apologizing for not believing me and breaking up with me over the phone without even giving me a chance, but in truth, I couldn't blame her and told her as much, since these were all people she grew up with. She didn't really have a reason to not believe them, since they never did this sort of thing before. This was followed by some shit talking of her former friends, that was kind of nice and we ended up having a few laughs over it, even though I could tell she was sad by what happened. She's only got two friends now, an older woman from her workplace and a girl her age from a hobby workshop. They seem to be good for her, from what she's saying, but she admits that  occasionally she misses what she had with her previous friends, if not the people themselves. 

I really did end up feeling better from that one talk and when the time came to go our separate ways, she asked me if I would be open to talking with her more in the future. Alice was upfront about her hoping that there might still be something between us in the future, but she wasn't pushy about it. Anyway, told her I wouldn't know, but also told her to just talk when she feels like it and I might or might not reply. Exchanged numbers and that was it for the day. 

Without dragging this out any further, we started dating again. Talking ended up bringing back how I used to feel about her, but I was holding back for a lot of the time and she was very patient with me. Never tried to push too much, never tried to just pick up from where we ended. It's basically dating like we've never dated with each other, in some way. Not sure if I can describe it properly, English isn't my first language. I guess it's got that good part of where you're getting to know someone and actually enjoying doing so. A lot of talk about trust has been had. 

Just a few days back was when after a night out she invited me to her place. I knew what this was about obviously, but I wasn't 100% sure. I guess I was just being cautious on some level. Alice seemed to sense it and let me off with some words of how I might need some rest for work in the morning, so she'd understand. I can't really tell you how that made me feel exactly, but it - it just shows me she cared. She cares and I went up with her and it was something I really fucking missed. It's not just two people together. It's her and me together. So yeah, we're together, we're dating and we're taking it a bit slowly, but I'm happy and she's happy and things aregood. 

**tl;dr** We met, talked a lot, then talked some more after that. Started dating again and I'm happy.",relationship_advice
My (23F) husband (31M) shaved our cat for no reason,"This is really fucking weird and I'm not sure what to do from here.

When I woke up this morning the cat had practically no fur. There are stubbly patches on her body, and the legs, head, and tail still have their fur but most of the rest is clean sheared off. I obviously asked my husband what the hell happened, we're the only people here and she's a strictly indoor cat.

He was very nonchalant. He said she was shedding too much and he was tired of the hair everywhere. So he just shaved her instead of brushing more or something? She's a short haired cat, and it's not shedding season either, there's really not that much hair. And even if that wasn't the case who shaves a cat? That does not sound comfortable for them and he could have easily injured her. I checked her over and her skin seems fine, but still!

I also asked how he did it. He first used a pair of scissors to cut the fur down, then used a heavy duty razor he ordered online. He never thought to mention wanting to do this, just went ahead and did it. (Of course I would have shut the idea down if he'd brought it up)

Then the other thing is a few weeks ago our downstairs neighbor's cat turned up shaved too. It's an outdoor cat. I saw it like that and asked the neighbor what happened, she said she had no idea. The cat usually roams around a lot but will come home a few times a day for food, and it had come back like that one morning. The neighbor told me she assumed it was kids or something. Now I'm forced to wonder if my husband had anything to do with it because this was so bizarre and unnecessary to me. I have no actual proof, it's just a very strange coincidence. 

My husband doesn't want to talk about it and snapped at me to stop bugging him. He said it's not a big deal and that lots of people shave their cats. While I'm sure some people do I know it's not ""lots"".

I'm not happy about this. She's technically both of ours since we live together, but I've had her since I was 19 first living on my own. That was long before I met him and I still consider her ""my"" cat. I feel like he went and did something behind my back when it wasn't his decision to make... maybe that's dramatic.

I don't know why but it's bothering me. Is there anything more I should do? Am I overreacting?",relationship_advice
My boyfriend has No Boundries with ExWife,"First post on Reddit ever, so please bear with me.  
I met my SO 6 months ago on Tinder. We hit it off fabulously.   Spent tons of time together,  our children met, our families met,  declared we loved each other, had great respect for each other, and all in all, felt very safe and secure in the relationship.   Until 2 days ago. 
He has an ex wife who he has admitted still wants him.  They had 3 children together and of course need to co parent these children.  One of their children plays for a competitive sports team, and that team were travelling for a championship game which my SO needed/wanted to attend.  Told me the original plan was he was travelling by himself with his kids and staying at a hotel.  Which ive known about for a month.  No problem.   Woke me up 1 hour before he was to take this trip and advised that there had been a change in plans and now he and ex wife were travelling together this long distance trip and they were staying all together in a hotel room because his ex wife had suggested it to him the day before and he felt it was a good idea.  Then just asked me if i was uncomfortable with that and left to take his daughter to school.  Upon his return,  his other children were there, so unwilling to discuss anything in front of them.  Cue the ex wife into the house, waiting for him, and he turns to me and says with her right beside him- ""We good?"" .... suffice to say, we not good.  At all.  I sent him a text explaining how this made me feel (hurt, confused) and he said it was a shitty text and that i am attacking him and now he won't answer my calls or my texts.  
Wtf did i do wrong? Doesn't this seem like absolutely no boundries set with his ex wife? Am I correct in wanting to just walk away? Any advice would be appreciated.

Broke up with my girlfriend after she told me she was HIV positive,"I (26) found out two days ago that my now ex girlfriend (21) was HIV positive. We had been together for almost 8 months and I never used protection with her. When she disclosed her status to me she said it was "" undetectable"" with the medicine she was taking so that my chances of being infected were zero/none. Right after she told me I went to get tested and thankfully everything came back negative. I feel so bad for leaving her because she was born with the disease so it's not her fault she has it. When we started seeing each other she started making an effort to take her HIV medication on a regular basis, workout, eat healthy, and even decided to go back to schooI...As someone who still loves her, I want her to continue doing all of those things even without me in her life. I know her viral load is undetectable with medicine but how easily can that change? Should she have told me this earlier? Am I wrong for leaving her? How can I support her moving forward as a friend?",relationship_advice
Boyfriend (26M) hit me and I (26F) am worried he's dead,"This is all so fucking crazy, I wish I could just rewind and start over.

I've been dating my boyfriend since we were 20 and he was always very charming, handsome, and respectful. Basically the perfect guy. My parents loved him and I love him so so much, my heart physically hurts when I think about what he's doing to himself.

He started doing coke more as a social thing - we moved to a new city because he found a better job and his new work friends did it. The first time he did it, I freaked out and was all like what the fuck are you doing, because I do not like drugs one bit. He thought it was fine because it was ""classy"" since it's expensive and businessmen and celebrities do it. I'm not shitting you, he literally said that to me. I thought he was fucking insane but I obviously couldn't stop him. I tried to deal with it and think, okay it's just for fun and it's not affecting his job or anything and we seem fine.

He kept doing it and it drove me insane. A fun treat turned into a habit and when I tried telling him he needed to get help, he'd tell me he had it under control and that he didn't need to do it, he just liked it and didn't wanna deprive himself of feeling good. Btw, he acted like a complete asshole when he was high. Talking a lot of shit and acting like he was super cool. It was nauseating and embarrassing to see him acting like that - the charming guy I loved was gone and replaced with this disgusting, narcissistic character.

I even told him once that I wanted to do it with him because he liked it so much and I wanted to see the hype. I thought he was going to say no to protect me from it. Nope, he got extremely excited and helped me do it. It was okay, I guess, but not anything I would be willing to prioritize over my life. He saw it as a bonding moment and felt more open to talk to me about it, how he wanted to do it together again and how the sex was so much better.

We have been through so much because of this. He's been in rehab twice but left and he's a grown man, I can't force him to do anything. Our parents don't know. His parents were sending him some money when we first moved to help us get started in a new place. They don't send money anymore but he still doesn't want them to know. He doesn't want me to tell my parents because he doesn't think it's their business or a big deal. I feel so incredibly embarrassed as well. I've always been a good kid, never the one my parents had to worry about and my mom would probably have a heart attack if she found out about this.

He came back from rehab and he kept using. Then one night he just disappeared. I tried calling his bitch ass friends and his job and no one knew where he was. I found out he was fired weeks before for fighting someone and destroying shit. He called me in the morning and was just being a condescending asshole, making fun of me for being worried about him and laughing. It was the weirdest shit. I didn't see him for days and it was horrible. He wouldn't tell me where he was.

Then he came back home one night randomly and came into our bed. I was so fucking mad but I was worried about where he was so I let him stay. I was crying and made him promise he would stop or else I was leaving for good. I even got up and packed up a few bags to scare him and it worked, he promised he would never use again if I didn't make him go to rehab. So I agreed that I would take care of him. I took off of work, fed and bathed him like he was a baby. I think he had started using something else too because he just seemed so messed up. He was depressed and angry at me, it was horrible to watch.

Eventually, he got over it and it felt like we were the closest we'd ever been and we loved each other so much. We talked about everything, things I'd never told him before, and it felt like we were on cloud nine. He was determined to stay clean and I believed him. We were okay for a bit, probably one month.

My parents were coming to visit and I was really excited about not having to hide anything - we were good and we didn't have to lie about all that stuff anymore. We could just forget about it. Well, he disappeared again the day before they came and he stole $1,200 from me. I can't even describe how it felt waking up and the house being empty. I couldn't even tell myself he went to the store or something. I knew he was gone. Typing this out, my hands are shaking. I hated him so much for doing that to me. My parents came and I had to lie and say he had a last-minute work conference event or whatever shit, I don't know. They knew something was wrong but didn't say anything. I hated lying to my parents but how was I supposed to tell them - oh yeah, you know that amazing guy you've known for years? He's addicted to coke or crack or some shit and he stole my money and lied to me and I've been lying this whole time and he has no job and he's a fucking lying bitch ass.

When they went home, I went into a depression. I was just thinking about how he came home and we were together and things were so so so good and how everything was actually bullshit. He was so skinny and felt self-conscious about it and didn't want me to see him since I became bigger than him but I didn't give a shit about that, I just wanted him healthy again. When he was going through withdrawal and was sick, I would give him baths every night since he couldn't do it himself. Even when he got better, he didn't want to have sex and I understood. And then one night he asked if I'd take a bath with him. I asked if he was having a bad day and not feeling good but, he gave me this cute smile and just shook his head. I was so excited that I had him back. He really fucking tricked me. Shit.

He ended up coming home a few days later. He was high as shit and didn't even care. He was just smiling and ignoring me, giving me this look as if he was so much better than me like looking at me and smiling or furrowing his eyebrows and shaking his head and laughing while I yelled at him, as if I were crazy or something. I told him I fucking hated him and he ruined my life but he didn't care. And then I said I was going to tell our parents and that got his attention. He started cursing at me, calling me a bitch and slut and whore, things that didn't even make sense. I told him off for stealing my money and he took it out of his bag, saying he actually still had half and threw it in my face. I tried telling him to get out but he said he wasn't going anywhere since it was actually his house. We bought the house together. Yeah, he put more money into it but he hadn't been fucking working for months and I was paying for everything. Then I did something really stupid. I don't know why I did it. I took my phone and said I was gonna call his parents and tell them that their son was a fucking loser crackhead. I was just trying to scare him - I would never call them like that, in the middle of a fight in front of him. Anyway, he was yelling at me to stop and he pushed me on the wall and we struggled for a bit. He tried grabbing my phone but I had quick reflexes and I'm pretty petite so I was able to just pull away from him. Then he grabbed my hand and put his arm on my chest to hold me down and was calling me a bitch and screaming at me. I was yelling back and tried pushing him off me and pushed on his chest and his shoulder and then he slapped me really hard on my cheek. Like, swinging his arm, left a ringing in my ear, bruising kind of hard. He had never hit me before - he used to never like play fighting because he was scared he'd accidentally hurt me.

He let me go and I just sat on the floor and cried. He got really fidgety and I could tell he felt bad about it but he still did it. He told me ""c'mon get up, it wasn't that bad"". I told him I hated him. Then he had a panic attack or something, he started breathing really hard. He just mumbled he was sorry, grabbed some money from the floor and left.

Two weeks later, he called me and was crying and said he was sorry for everything and wanted to come home. I said I never wanted to see him again. He begged and promised me that he would go to rehab but I told him I was over his lies and he promised that he'd get clean for real this time but I kept saying no and that he needed to call his parents.

Then he asked me if I'd come see him in the hospital if he OD'd and I told him no. He cried harder and said he didn't want to die and he was gonna be good for me. I knew he was lying and probably ran out of money or something. I hate myself and think about this every day but I just hope him I hoped he died and hung up. That was a few days ago and I haven't heard from him and I am so scared that he's dead somewhere or passed out on the street and in need of help. I can't believe I said that to him and feel so horrible - that's not the kind of person I am, I would never wish death upon someone, especially him. I don't want him to die. I was just trying to hurt him.

This is so long and I'm sorry but I can't tell anyone about this and it's killing me. I think about everything that happened between us, all the little details that he probably never noticed or remembers. I feel depressed and on edge all the time. My mind is always thinking about him, hoping he's okay. I feel like I wasted my life on him and don't know what to do. I've been dealing with this nightmare for so long and I still miss him so much, my heart physically hurts. What did I do to deserve this?

Edit: Wow. I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied. I certainly did not expect to wake up to 200+ comments and everyone who offered me any inch of support and advice and even criticism (because I know I made mistakes, I should have taken action right at the beginning and not let this escalate and accept his fucked up behavior. I'm an enabler, I know) thank you for listening and I cried a lot reading your comments, that you guys have all been through the same exact thing and he's not gonna change and even if he does, it'll take years and he'll never be the same person and I can't trust him. It's a hard truth to swallow but you guys are right.

It feels like a small weight has been lifted off of my shoulders and those telling me that I'm strong - thank you but it doesn't really feel like it. ",relationship_advice
My boyfriend hit me during an argument. Is this who he is?,"I don't know what to do or what to think. Please please please help me

Me and my boyfriend are both 24 and have been together 3 years. We just moved into a  flat over summer. Up to now he's been wonderful. He's thoughtful, sweet and smart. We rarely fight and even when we do he's never so much as called me out of my name. I'm stunned and devastated that this happened.

This all started because I posted a selfie I took at the gym on my instagram story. It wasn't a racy picture or anything of the sort. It was just a mirror pic in normal gym attire, leggings and a tank top. I came home when I was done where he was sat on the couch waiting for me. He greeted me politely but quickly brought up the selfie, making a joke about how other men were going to try to steal me after seeing that. I laughed it off but he looked at me kind of weird. It was confusing because it wasn't the first time I've ever posted a gym selfie before. I have photographs of myself in bikinis on my page and I never heard a complaint out of him. I couldn't tell if he was serious.

He grew agitated quickly which is not how he's ever been. This whole situation escalated so quickly. He point blank told me to take it down as it made him uncomfortable. I said no primarily out of annoyance at his behavior. He posts shirtless pictures on his own page and I never got upset. We had a row for a short while when I asked where all this was coming from. His response was to shout in my face out of nowhere, ""I guess I didn't realize you were such a dirty slut."" 

I am not one who tolerates being spoken to like that by anyone. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have never seen him like that before in 3 years. I expected him to apologize when he realized what he had said. Instead he started pacing back and forth looking furious. I asked him what the fuck was wrong with him. He got right back in my face again and said, ""I won't ask again, just delete the fucking picture and don't talk back.""
He was being so aggressive. That was when I really felt afraid of him. He is twice my size and very strong. I pushed him trying to get him away from me. He then punched me in the face, closed fist. I have never been hit in the face before by anybody. I fell to the ground where he kicked me repeatedly in the back and side. 

I was sobbing on the floor and he finally seemed to come back to his senses. He started crying too. Tried to hug me while I was telling him to get away. He kept apologizing and saying he hit me out of self defense since I pushed him first. However when I pushed him, he hardly moved at all. I was terrified of him in that moment. I told him to get out or I would phone the police. Crying still, he packed a bag and has been staying with a friend since. This was 4 days ago. We have not spoken despite his efforts to reach out. 

I have a bruise on my face and on my side from where he kicked me. They both hurt to touch. It hurts to even breathe too deeply. I've lied to friends about where the bruise on my face came from because I don't know what to do. He's been my partner for 3 years. I never saw this coming. I cannot believe that this is who he is because there were no warning signs that anything like this would happen. I saw myself someday marrying this man just a week ago, and now I'm unsure if I'll ever feel safe around him again. I know that everyone's initial reaction would be to tell me to end the relationship. However again, this is the first time in 3 years he's ever been violent towards me. I'm still pretty in shock. Is it possible that this was just a one time thing? Something we can overcome? I never imagined myself in a situation like this. Any advice would be helpful since I cannot ask my family or friends.",relationship_advice
I (29M) showed up to my gf's (25F) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.,"This is a throwaway for the obvious reasons. 
I had plans to hang out with my gf after her class tonight around 9-10pm. So texted her something nice around that time to let her know i was thinking of her, and see when she would be done. No response. She texts me hii a couple hours later, I responded hey what's up. At this point a little upset she had blown me off for hours past the time she said she would hit me up after class.
No response again. This time for the rest of the night. I was starting to get worried bc I know she leaves campus late and it can be sketchy in that area sometimes. I text her and call her a couple more times no response. 

At this point I'm definitely worried and text her I'm gonna stop by to make sure she's all good, she's a girl and lives alone and just 5 min from me. So i swing by and all the lights are on, I walk up to the front door and knock.

She comes out looking surprised. Steps outside, oddly. I say what's up i was worried you weren't ok I never heard back from you and you kinda bailed on our plans. She then says oh sorry I've been hanging with some friends from school. So I ask is someone in there right now, and she tries to casually play off ya there is a guy from class over we've been hanging out talking about our class. 
(Mind you, it's 2am. )

She then asks me to come in and if i want to meet him. I say yes. I come in and meet this guy who looks a bit startled. Introduce myself and then they start catching me up on what they were talking about. My gf is acting pretty odd like super causal that the fact i just showed up at 130am after she's been ignoring me and there's a random guy I don't know there... she's acting like it's no big deal. 
Within 20 min I decide I'm going home, and ask her to walk me out. I then ask her to make the guy leave bc there's no reason to be there that late. She says no we were in the middle of a conversation...
I try explaining to her this isn't cool with me and makes me uncomfortable and she doesn't seem to care one bit. She just says, I'm not gonna argue with you another this while someone is right here, we can talk tomorrow. And then walks back inside. 

I tried not to make a scene and be respectful of her house, while still letting her know it wasn't cool. Am I crazy or are those serious red flags and am I being naive here? I have to talk to her tomorrow and Im not sure how to approach this. 

TLDR; showed up at 130am to gf house, another guy from her class was over there I didn't know. She played it cool and we all talked and then I left and went home and he was still there at 2am.

I'm [34/M] and caught my wife [32/f] cheating on me on our 10th anniversary trip in Bali.,"I took my wife on a 10th anniversary trip to Bali and I caught her cheating on me. My world is completely shattered right now. She's still in Bali and I took an early flight home. I had suspected her of cheating earlier in the year but had no concrete proof. 

I don't know what steps to take now. She keeps telling me she's not sure what she wants even though we have been together for 13 years and married for 10 and she just met this guy! I can't even begin to understand the thought process she's going through. It feels like being stabbed so hard in the heart.

I wanted to update everyone on my previous post [My mother sent me a hateful letter].,"First off, I wanted to thank everyone for all of their support. It truly meant a lot and made me feel so much better about myself and this whole situation. It's been taking me quite some time to get through all of the comments because there were just so many.

I wanted to update everyone on what happened since the last time I posted. So I blocked my mother in all forms of contact, phone, email, text, etc... I left my father unblocked because I do have two younger siblings at home and wanted to just make sure I was reachable in case of an emergency.

A few days after that letter, I got a call from my father. I answered it but planned on hanging up if it was my mother and just blocking that number as well. He said hello and then went on a lecture about how I ""disrespected my mother"" and ""am an ungrateful little b**ch"". He also told me that I was so longer welcome in their home. I was not to come back for any holidays or have any contact with them. 

I told him I was fine with that and hung up. I immediately blocked his number on all forms of contact as well. It was tough to hear that because I used to be close to my father when I was younger. We were always called partners in crime, so to hear him to take her side was rough, but I didn't cry. I knew they weren't worth it and not worth my tears. I ended up getting a few texts of hateful family members but just blocked them as well.

I also know that I probably won't be allowed to be in contact with my siblings till they turn 18 because they still live at home. We used to extremely close so I hope one day we can be again.

My husband and I decided it was in our families best interest to get a restraining order again my mother and father. Just to fully show them that I am done with them. We have our adoption case at the end of this month so we plan on waiting till April just so we don't screw anything up with that. 

We also talked to the kids school and told them nobody can pick them up unless we send a note that day, we changed our locks and put some of the evidence in a safety box. We do live 14 hours away which is nice.

I decided not to let them have this power of my and my family. My MIL and FIL are absolutely incredible. And more then willing to step up and be both sets of grandparents.

I just wanted to update you all and say that I'm done with my family at least for now and am not worried about them anymore.",relationship_advice

I ended up leaving my moms early that day with my brother and sister after her boyfriend went even further than he had before, I don't even feel comfortable putting what he did on this post.

I'm not too sure about the exact details on what happened between my mom, dad, and the lawyers yesterday but my dad ended up with full custody of me and my two siblings. The only time my mom and her boyfriend is allowed to see any of us now is through our own consent. 

Thank you for all the support and advice on the original post it was very hard for me to actual say something about the whole situation because I was honestly embarrassed about it.",relationship_advice
I(M43) had a child with my best friend(F40) and my girlfriend(F45) can't cope with it,"My best friend Jen and I had a child 10 years ago. No one of us had found a life partner and Jen was diagnosed with something that would soon leave her infertile. We decided that we were going to have a kid together and I offered to pay for the IVF because I was the one from a wealthy family.

We had our beautiful baby boy and have been happy ever since. We haven't slept together or anything. We live in the same house. But the house is separated in 2 apartments with a big inside patio on the first floor.

This living arrangement works for us and we can raise our boy in a functional family.
3 years ago Jen met Roger who is an awesome guy and father of a daughter. So we do have a patch work family. Roger is a good bud of me Yada Yada.

One year ago Monica and I got together. I was very upfront about my living situation. And she said she was okay with is. Monica herself has 2 kids that I really do like very much.

So now to the problem.
Monica was really nice to Jen in the beginning. But I have been noticing that she is being more passive aggressive towards her. When we have big family outings, meaning taking all the kids to the zoo or a park, Monica does her best to alienate us from the group.

She gets mad when she comes to my place and Jen and I are sitting on the couch watching some sort of cop show. We don't even cuddle we just share a couch.

She gets mad when we take our son to a family trip to a theme park alone because she says it's weird.

She got super fucking mad when I was walking down with Monica to help her pack her car and placed a hand on her back because I was ""inappropriately touching another woman"".

I love Monica and I have tried to be reassuring that, despite me having a child with jen, I don't feel any sort of attraction toward her.

She has been pressuring me to move out which I don't want. The city we live in, is very expensive and the house I live in is all paid for. It's 2 apartments we have full privacy from each other. Jen and Roger also do their thing. I know this is a weird situation. But I have never tried to hide it. I have always been very honest about everything and also honest about my intentions to not moving.

Monica hasn't talked to me in days and I wonder if this relationship has run its course or if I have a shot at repairing it?

Edit : sorry I am bad at conveying stuff. So we don't spend every free second with Jen. This family weekends are like once a month when Roger has his kid ans Monica hers. There we tend to splurge on theme parks, aquariums etc. But ofcourse when Monica comes over she doesn't have to spend time with Jen. As said we have different appartements in the same house. While the doors are unlocked for our sons sake we only spend time in the other apartment when we watch something together or sometimes have family dinner. Which isn't everyday. So we have our privacy.

Edit2: the reason why Jen and I knoe that there are no feelings is because before having our son we talked about it. Having a child in a couple that had o sided feelings would not have worked. We came to the conclusion that no one of us had seen the other at any point in a romantic light.",relationship_advice
[Another Update] Should I be concerned about my daughter's (18 F) relationship with her married teacher (40s M)?,"Original Post:

Previous Update:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8poj55/update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters/?st=JI7P1S9T&sh=ed83f0a1

As of yesterday I felt like I was handling this situation the best way I possibly could. As of today I feel like a failure of a mother.

I got up really early this morning around 3 AM to give my daughter's father a call. He's over in Europe at the moment so I figured that time would be best for him, but I mostly just wanted to get ahold of him before my daughter woke up so that she wouldn't overhear any of the conversation and think that I was going behind her back. I decided to do a quick check before I called him and peaked into her bedroom to make sure she was still asleep. Maybe I'm naïve for being shocked and completely caught off guard by this, but not only did I discover that my daughter wasn't asleep, she was gone. I have never known her to be the type to sneak out (though I guess it's called ""sneaking out"" for a reason) and even when she's gone out late with friends in the past she's always let me know beforehand.

Of course I freaked out and tried desperately to get ahold of her. I sent her dozens of messages and tried calling her but it kept going straight to voicemail. After about 10 minutes I gave up on reaching her and was trying to figure out who to call that might know where she was when I heard the front door being unlocked. I went and stood out in the hallway and when she walked in and saw me she had a look of pure panic on her face. I never have been very strict with my daughter in the past, but in that moment I very sternly told her ""I need an explanation. Now.""

She instantly burst into tears. I asked her where she had been and I asked if she was with Mr. Smith but all she kept telling me was ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I finally just told her ""I have been nothing but loving and understanding with you. I know you're an adult now, but you still live under my roof. The least you owe me is the god damn truth."" I asked her once again where she had been and she said, still crying, ""out for a drive."" I asked if she was alone and she shook her head no. I asked if she was with her teacher and she hesitantly shook her head yes.

It took me a moment to sit and process that all of the things I was afraid of happening had likely been going on behind my back this whole time, and that my daughter had clearly lied straight to my face when I spoke with her yesterday. Eventually I said to her ""So I take it you weren't being honest with me when you told me you saw him as just a friend.""

To that remark she went from softly crying to sobbing. All she had to say was that she was sorry but she ""loves"" him.

I can't remember the last time I felt this angered or betrayed or disgusted. And not because of my daughter. Because of her teacher. This man has clearly been grooming and manipulating my daughter and I was stupid enough to not do something about it sooner and gave my daughter and her teacher the benefit of the doubt even with all of the obvious warning signs. Now it's probably too late for me to do anything.

We talked for a while and I tried my best to as calmly as possible explain my concerns about their relationship to her. I tried to tell her that it wasn't healthy and that being in a relationship with someone who once had a position of power over her is a recipe for disaster. I told her that it's easy for a man of his age and with his experience to take advantage of a younger girl. I also explained that a man who sneaks around with her when he has a wife and a family of his own is a man who does not truly respect her or care about her well being. To everything I said though she just responded with something along the lines of ""he's not like that, it's different with us.""

I was able to get her to talk a lot more about what's really been going on between them, but I don't feel it necessary or appropriate to share all of those details here. If you feel I've left out any significant details you are more than welcome to ask me to clarify something, but otherwise I'd prefer not to disclose more than what I have to as it is obviously an uncomfortable and sensitive topic. I do feel I should mention that she claimed the ""romantic"" aspect of their relationship only just recently began and that they were not romantically involved while she was his student. Of course, I've recently discovered that my daughter is more than capable of lying to me and covering these things up, so I am aware that this may be untrue and I will try to do some further digging into that matter.

At this point, as much as it kills me to admit it, I don't think there's anything I can do to stop this. I have spoken with my ex husband but he is at a bit of a loss too as to what to do about all this. He wants to confront Mr. Smith, but we are still trying to work out if that's the best idea and if it will really do any good in this situation. I will be reading up on the laws in my state and the policies of the school district, but besides potentially getting Mr. Smith fired I'm not sure that there's anything else that can be done legally speaking. I want to keep him as far away from my daughter as possible but I feel completely powerless in that, which crushes me. Trying to forbid her from seeing him seems like it would be pointless considering she is a legal adult. She is still dependent on her father and I and we could technically hold that against her to get her to stop seeing him, but that would no doubt permanently damage our relationship with her. Informing Mr. Smith's wife is also a possibility we've considered and would likely cause him to lose contact with my daughter, but that would of course cause my daughter to resent her father and I as well. Right now, I'm honestly so worried about her safety and her mental health that we may just end up having to do something that will result in her resenting us in order to protect her (and protect other female students in Mr. Smith's care). Trust me when I say, her father and I are considering every possible option.

Thank you to those of you taking the time to read all of this and thank you for continually offering your support and advice. Any suggestions you have of a solution (or legal advice) that I may not have thought of are absolutely welcome and greatly appreciated. However, any ""I told you so's"" or any criticism of my parenting is unwelcome and unnecessary. Believe me, you can't possibly be any harder on me than I am already being on myself at the moment.

TL;DR:  It turns out my daughter is in fact having an affair with her former teacher. Because the romantic part of their relationship supposedly began after she graduated, her father and I are afraid that there's nothing that can be done to put an end to their relationship. We are considering all possibilities, even those that may cause our daughter to resent us. Any helpful advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated at this time.

!!! Edit:  

Thank you for all of your responses. I am having a hard time keeping up with the comments, but my ex and I are very thankful for the helpful advice you all have given. After taking a lot of things you all have said into consideration, we've come up with a general plan on how to handle this. First and foremost, I will report this to the district office when it opens on Monday. Soon after we are trying to work out a small ""getaway"" trip I can do with my daughter, preferably to an area with poor cell service like up at a cabin to remove her from the situation unfolding. I don't want to hide all of this from her and plan to tell her how her father and I are handling things while we're on the trip, but I'd prefer that she not be able to have contact with Mr. Smith during this time. It may make for a miserable and awkward few days together, but I think keeping things open and honest with my child is important. My ex husband will be returning from Europe this upcoming week, so he will try to deal with speaking to the wife and Mr. Smith (separately or together, whichever works out) while my daughter and I are on vacation. Our hope is that all of this coming out in the open will scare Mr. Smith off, and that by the time my daughter and I return home he won't want to pursue things any further with her. This may seem like a cruel thing for us to do for her daughter, but at this point we feel it's what we have to do to protect her. We are still open to tweaking this plan however, so if you feel there is a better way we can handle this please feel free to share your opinions.

***Extra Note: I have received quite a few messages and comments suggesting that I get my daughter a therapist. I just wanted to clarify that she has actually been seeing a therapist for a couple years now ever since her father and I split up. I believe I mentioned this in a previous post. Thanks anyways for the suggestion though!",relationship_advice
"(FINAL UPDATE) Boyfriend of 3 years just admitted to cheating, we're on vacation together, I don't know what to do.","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ckzt29/boyfriend\_of\_3\_years\_just\_admitted\_to\_cheating/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ckzt29/boyfriend_of_3_years_just_admitted_to_cheating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Thank you to everyone that has commented or reached out after my last two posts. I first want to say that I am doing okay, even after what I am going to say in this post, I'm okay. I am going to attempt to make this as brief as possible because I can't give this situation any more of my heart or energy. But it will most likely be long. *Here we go*.

I am all moved out of the apartment, my things going into storage because I am still staying in my friend's home for the time being. This break up has proved to be financially burdensome but somehow money has managed to be the least stressful part of this ordeal. It turns out that I never knew the man I shared my life with for the past 3 years. My ex and I ended up having a conversation on the last day of us moving out. He seemed apologetic and sad and asked if we could talk. He said that he loves me, that he will always love me and he wants us to stay together. He apologized and said he would stop bullshitting, no more lies. I didn't feel the need to have a conversation but I did have just one question. I asked him ""why?""

I never could have imagined in a million years that he would tell me that the reason he cheated was because I miscarried 6 months ago. Especially because of how supportive and loving he was during that period in our lives, I felt blindsided and betrayed. He said that he knows that it was not my fault, that there was nothing I could have done differently but it had caused him to resent me. That he was angry. He said he knew how this sounded which is why he never talked to me about it. He didn't want to hurt me - ha. I of course at this point felt sick. My heart hurt in ways I never knew possible. Even the death of my father did not hurt in ways his words and actions were hurting me. Here is this man that I have unconditionally loved and supported for over three years. I was his biggest cheerleader in life, encouraged him to be his own person and to still live his own life. I wanted him to be happy. We never went to bed mad at each other, we never called each other names, we never not kissed each other goodnight or goodbye in the morning. Our relationship *seemed*great and yet he's telling me for the last six months he has resented me, borderline hated me at times.

He admitted to downloading Tinder and chatting with women over the last six months. He swore that it never became sexual up until the night he cheated and that was only because they had history. I have no clue if that is true. Honestly, I don't care whether or not it is. The cheating is minimal compared to the words he just spoke. We were both crying and I handed him my keys for him to turn in. I gave him a hug and told him that he needs therapy and that I never want to speak to or see him again. I have a therapy appointment next week and will start to work on healing.

I am looking at potentially getting a loan so I can get out of anything left that we have shared. I also want to look into moving to a different city but that is still up in the air. I have changed my phone number and blocked him everywhere. There was never a chance of him and I getting back together and this just solidifies my decision. This will most likely be my last post on the subject but I once again thank each and every one of you.",relationship_advice
I [34/m] found condom wrappers in our trash can. My wife [34/f] and I don't use them and I'm wondering how to approach this.,"I'm in a bit of a difficult spot here and looking for some advice.  Earlier this week I was taking the garbage out.  We have one of those large 90 gallon wheeled trash cans provided by the city and it sits outside.  I noticed that an animal had gotten into it and torn one of the bags open which happens occasionally.  I also noticed a couple of condom wrappers in there.  I had a vasectomy a few years ago and my wife and I don't use condoms.  This has led me to wonder if my wife might be cheating.  I realize this isn't damning evidence of course and there are other possible explanations.  And before now I've had no reason to suspect my wife of infidelity in the 10 years we've been married.  But I also don't want to be the naive guy who says ""Oh it could never possibly happen to me"" and ignores what's staring him in the face.  I'll try to organize my thoughts a little bit below.

There's a couple parts of this that make me suspect her, at least a little.  As I said, I can't think of anyone else in our house that could have used them and thrown them away.  It's been a couple years since we last used condoms but the wrappers I found were her favorite kind when we were using them.  We have two preschoolers and our sex life (and intimacy in general) has been in a little bit of a rut lately.  Not to a terrible degree or anything and likely no more than is to be expected given our situation right now.  But there have been some minor complaints from both of us about dissatisfaction with the status quo.

On the other hand, it's an outdoor trash can, so it's possible someone else could have thrown them in there.  Although we've lived in this house for about 6 years and I can't remember that ever happening before.  We've been married 10 years and I've never had any reason to question her fidelity before today.  And my wife's not stupid either.  I feel like if she was going to cheat she wouldn't be dumb enough to leave evidence just lying around where I could find it like that.

I'm looking for advice on what I should do next.  Do I just assume it was someone else throwing them away in there and forget about it?  Do I stay quiet about it but raise my ""alert level"" so to speak and be on the lookout for other evidence?  Do I actively go snooping for further evidence?  Or do I confront her about it?  Like I mentioned above, I don't want to be so gullible that I insist it could never happen to me, but I also don't want to damage a good relationship with false accusations or dishonest behavior.  Help?

**Edit to respond to some of the most common replies I'm getting:**

It's possible she's using them for sex toys, but I think it's unlikely.  We've used toys together from time to time, but it's very rare for her to use them by herself.  I know where we keep our toys and there are no condoms in there, so she'd have to be hiding them from me, which would be out of character for her.  

The wrappers were Trojan Fire and Ice.  Not normal condoms but not something super unusual either.

I'm not jumping straight to secret cameras, GPS trackers, or hiring a private eye.  Whether she's cheating or not those all have a high potential to end my marriage simply due to the level of distrust and paranoia involved.  If I find more evidence elsewhere I might go that far, but to me those ""confirm what I already know"" options not step one.

The trash in the torn-open bag was from our house, but due to the raccoon rooting around in there it's impossible for me to tell whether the wrappers were originally in the bag of trash or just thrown in the bin.  I didn't find any condoms.

She hasn't been secretive about her phone.  I checked phone records and there was nothing suspicious.

Thanks for the advice so far.",relationship_advice
"My (38f) brother (36m) stole $50,000 from me. Should I take him to court or walk away and never talk to him again?","Long story short. 7 years ago we bought an investment property together. We agreed he could live there rent free while he fixed it up and got settled in life. I ended up paying taxes and insurance every year and he's pretty much destroyed the house. It honestly looks like a crack house. I had an appraisal done last week and the home has lost half its value due to damages and lack of upkeep. I didn't realize it was that bad and had sent money over the years to make repairs, which he never did and pocketed the money. In addition, I gave him a personal loan of $5000, which he has never paid back.

My brother is an alcoholic and has a job, but it's barely minimum wage. The house is in my name, so I could start the eviction process, but I'm pretty sure he would be homeless then. I don't see how I could ever get my money back unless I sold the house, but is it worth the hassle? Should I just accept I made a mistake trusting him and walk away from the relationship?

He denies responsibility, feels like he's done nothing wrong, says he's struggling, that he'll pay me back, do better, etc etc

Also, my brother received $30,000 last year from an inheritance and didn't pay me back or make needed repairs on the house he said he would.

Tl;dr*  Should I take my brother to court to kick him out of a house we co-own that he has destroyed or just walk away and take the financial loss?

Update: I'm selling the house to an investor. Thank you everyone for your comments and support. It gave me the courage to take action! I'm on the fence about giving him cash to move out and then a portion of the profit. Any thoughts?",relationship_advice
Today I caught my wife of nearly 4 years cheating on me.,"EDIT 3: It all kicked off today, but of a long update. After work I needed to call into a few shops at a local shopping park. When I returned, wife was there in the friends car, blocking the driver door. She had the spare key and would allow entry. After giving plenty of warning I called 101 (police none emergency line, on the advice of her mother) to report the incident. A few minutes later the friend moved the car, wife jumped in and wouldn't allow entry. She started the engine, rolled the window down and shouted ""nobody upsets my son, this is your fault. I'm going to smash the car up"". She then drove off. I dialled 999 to report the car still an (finance in my name, registered in my name etc). An officer arrived and after speaking with me said it was a civil matter and no crime was committed. The mother then called to say wife returned home without the car. The officer went round to question her, she refused to say where it was. Nothing was done. I have been out with a friend searching for the car. We heard a rumour it was in a car park in a small village about 20 miles away. We drove there to find it wasn't. However, we spoke to a police man (different force) who out out an ANPR check. The car was spotted 20 mins after being taken, just outside of the town we live in. He also stated the other police force should have treated this as theft, and she should have been arrested. We didn't find the car, but tomorrow I will speak with the police again to push further on the matter. I may also post on UK legal advice about this. 

EDIT 2: I have had some requests for an update. There isn't much more to report. I am still away from the house, and we still have not spoken. Although I hear she still insists nothing happened. I still don't believe her. I spoke to her son last night, he was distraught. I spoke to him today and he is doing better. I also text his dad to let him know, he sent a nice response back thanking me for being in the kids life, and for everything I have done for him. Tomorrow, I start the solicitor hunt. More updates to follow...

EDIT: thank you for all the advice so far, everyone has been really helpful. I have tried to reply to as many as possible! Thank you internet strangers. 

Apologies, this is a long one. TL;DR at the end. Also sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

Bit of background. My wife was going on a night out with one of her girl friends. Her friend picked her up and they went into town. Wife forgot her key, i needed to keep the back door unlocked. 

It gets to 1 am, i send her a text saying dont be too late due to the door being open. No response. 2.30am still not home. At this point I start calling but there is no answer. Fast forward to 8am, 70ish calls later and still no sign of her. I was very worried at this point. 

Backtrack a little, to around 1am when I notice on her laptop (which she left on, but on the lockscreen) a notification of a Facebook message, from a random guy telling her what bar she was in but then no further messages.

So then this morning she finally texts me to say she is at her friends. I then check the laptop again and see an exchange of messages between her and said friend (I can't see what wife is saying, just friends responses).

The friend was asking if she was home yet, and when she would go home. She then asked wife ""What is your story? I will make sure I stick to it"". They then plan the story about why she had to take a taxi home, and friend was saying ""don't worry for all he knows you Are here asleep in my spare room"". After a few further messages the best message of the lot was sent.

""So, how big was his dick then?"" I photographed all the messages. 

Later when wife returns home at first I play it cool like i dont know what went on. She is walking around the house acting perfect, like nothing was wrong. Eventually I confront her, and show the messages. At first she swore blind she was at the friends house, and that I could call her to check that (of course I could, they had already got their stories straight). When I showed her the last message she eventually admitted she was at this guy's house, slept in his bed but nothing happened. I calmly left the house with her yelling at me to leave.

12 hours later, i am now not speaking with her or responding to messages. She started saying she did nothing wrong and that I was the one throwing it all away. Apparently me leaving was proof I never loved her. 

Now we are at the borderline emotional blackmail stage. Claiming she is heartbroken along with her son (Not mine,  he is from a previous relationship). I feel she is trying to make me feel bad about leaving, like I should go running back to her. She broke my trust, and for me that's the end. She still swears nothing happened between them, i dont have solid evidence they did sleep together, but i feel the evidence strongly points towards that. She wants to talk like adults and sort things out. In all honesty I don't even think this is the first time she has done this now I know she is capable of it. 

How do i get past this? Currently I have zero intention of going back to her. I dont know what to do with myself. Any advice on how to handle this?

TL;DR I am 99% certain she cheated. How to I move forward and handle this?",relationship_advice
Unbeknownst to me (32M) my wife (30F) is back on birth control. I had a vasectomy years ago,"As the title says, I have had a vasectomy done when I was 25. We are both child free so it only made sense to have a permanent solution rather than using condoms or other forms of contraception. My wife used to be on the pill but always complained about how annoying it was taking it and so on. We did not have any issues for all these years and neither ever mentioned birth control since.


Fast forward to now, we recently moved into a new home and I am tasked with redoing a bathroom. After I installed the vanity, I begun putting our stuff in it. My wife has a small pouch where she keeps her ""travel kit"" for her work trips. It's a toothbrush, paste, small bottle of mouthwash, makeup and Ibuprofen. I was having a terrible headache and our house has been upside down for a while now, so when I remembered that she keeps pain killers in that pouch, I opened it to get one. Inside, I found birth control pills. It would make no sense for her to keep the pills from 7 years ago, especially since she has used this pouch multiple times for her work trips. It's not like I found them in a long forgotten corner. 

Then, for the first time in our 10 year relationship, I doubted her. I sat on the couch and started to think of all the possible reasons she might be taking those behind my back. For one, she is on my health insurance so I would see if she had a doctor's appointment for an issue unrelated to contraception. I know that BC pills are used for other purposes. She is healthy and would certainly share with me if something was wrong medically. Why would she hide it? Especially in the light of her complains regarding the pill. 

I decided to put the pills back in there and act like I didn't see them that night. I checked back the next morning and sure enough, another pill was missing. So, she is actively taking them. I'm lost. Part of me doesn't want to know and I wish I could just erase that from my memory. We are happy together, we have a wonderful life, and I cannot prepare for it all to come crumbling down. I'm not ready to learn that she is cheating but I can't go on without knowing what's going on. 

How do I approach this without sounding accusatory? If she genuinely has a medical problem, and I cannot imagine she had and would hide it from me, I don't want to make her feel attacked. Tell me there's a good reason why she would take the pills. 

TL;DR: had a vasectomy years ago, found that wife is back on birth control without my knowledge

EDIT: wow guys, I was at work and came back to a lot of replies. I'm reading through them now and the general consensus seems to be that she likely has a valid medical reason for taking them. She'll be home soon and I will have the conversation.

EDIT 2: she is likely cheating. I'm still shocked/mad/upset and can't write everything right now but we discussed and she had a very weird reaction to me bringing it up. First she accused me of ""going through her things"". Then she said it doesn't matter anyway because she has nothing to hide. She could not explain the reason behind her taking the pills.

Should I tell my dying husband I'm pregnant?,"FINAL(ish) UPDATE: Found out I'm like 15 weeks pregnant not 4. Baby is a girl. She will be loved and a welcome part of our family. I will tell Steve. Feel free to keep commenting as I enjoy commenting back, but the decision has been made. Thanks everyone

Bonus update: I've gotten like 5 messages that you can't tell sex of the baby that early, and y'all can go take it up with the tech who seemed pretty fucking sure of herself.

Original post:

(Sorry I posted this like an hour ago and then got super paranoid my older son was going to see it so I deleted it, but I just low-key found out he doesn't even go on Reddit anymore so I'm going to try this again. Thank you to the couple of people who responded before I took it down, I've saved all your replies.) (Also changed my throwaway so it meets the new rules I think)

Hey this is really shitty but I'm 39F and mother of two teens, and married to a (40M) guy I'll call Steve. Sorry if this is all a mess, it's a bit of a messed up story

The marriage was basically one of convenience. Steve and I are both divorced and have been friends for decades. This past spring Steve found out he has a rare cancer and the doctors gave him 6ish months to live.

Three years ago Steve sought out the daughter he had before his marriage from a one night stand in his 20s. When he found her he discovered his daughter (10 years old, I'll call her Sara), was being horrifically abused by her mother, who had had some kind of mental break I guess. Anyway he spent a year fighting for custody of this child he hadn't seen since she was a baby, and he eventually got it, then spent 2ish years working with her and getting her to heal and trust him and SURPRISE! he's fucking dying.

Anyway the marriage thing was mostly about Sara. We were advised that is getting married would be the quickest/easiest way to make sure I get custody of Sara when Steve passes, in case Sara's mother decides to try for custody again.

And as a side note I 100% do want custody of Sara, no question, I love her very very much. She's already like a sister to my two kids and similar in age. That girl has gone from not owning a fucking pair of shoes to being a funny, smart, all around great kid.

Anyway we got married on paper (no wedding), and Steve and Sara moved into my house. All the kids knew what was happening and were surprisingly cool with it.

Yeah so, stuff happened between me and Steve. He confessed he had been in love with me for a long time, and I just kind of said it all back to him even though I'm not 100% sure of my feelings. It all just happened fast idk. Maybe that was wrong of me but I wanted his time left to be happy and I do care for him a lot

In the last few weeks Steve has gone downhill very quickly. He is still mostly at home except for a few short hospital stays. There are nurses that come every day and he is on strong pain medicine, so sometimes he's himself but a lot of times really out of it. He's basically just here dying right in front of my fucking eyes and it sucks.

And I just found out this week that I'm pregnant. I'm not sure that I want to keep the baby. I'm old as dirt with now 3 teenage kids to think of. I'm strongly considering not telling Steve at all, but it feels very wrong.

Telling him also feels wrong. He's more upset about leaving Sara than he is about dying, so finding out he's leaving another kid behind will probably only hurt him.

Having an abortion feels wrong. Keeping the kid feels wrong. Nothing about this is okay and I really just want a cigarette and a bottle of wine.

TL;DR hahahaha life sucks

Update: I am pretty sure I'm going to keep the baby and tell Steve, but I want to sleep on it first (also Steve is definitely out for the night). Thanks for listening. Going to do the dishes, feed the cat, and go to bed. Will continue to read and respond to comments when I can and hopefully update at some point before the weekend.

Update update: Saw obgyn this morning way too early (seriously why are you even open at 8am?) and here's the twist: I'm not a month pregnant, I'm like 3+ months pregnant. No I'm not relieved, I'm pissed off that I had another choice taken away from me. I'm sick of my life feeling like a speeding train that I have no control over. I'm sick of everyone romanticising everything. I'm tired of everyone saying I'm strong when I feel like I'm just doing the bare minimum to keep my head above water. I'm just gonna be angry for a little while, thx",relationship_advice
"UPDATE: My girlfriend is falling for another guy, what do I do? FINAL UPDATE","Previous post

Hey guys.

I figured I'd give you one final update. Unless you guys want another one after court. Let me know.

We are all awaiting court. Mine is in 2 weeks and so is my exes. My ex's boyfriends is in 3 weeks. I don't think they will last though because it's seriously looking like they're gonna do some time. My lawyer is telling me he thinks they might get years. I forgot to add that she actually got charged for Fraud and identity theft as well because apparently she was trying to use my social security card for something. I'm really glad I listened to everyone and called the cops.

She keeps trying to tell me to get back together with her and that she'll break up with the other guy and that we will have the life we were supposed to have. It sounds tempting but as soon as I drop those charges I know she'd run. 

I'm not dropping anything. My son is currently at my house with me. I'm hoping to get full custody. If she somehow avoids jail it's going to be very hard. But I'm going to try. 

That's it guys. I can update after court again if you want. Just let me know. I'm scared for court too because I don't want to go to jail. My ex's grandma is actually paying for all my legal fees because I told her the story and she always liked me and she felt really bad. She also gave me a very very hefty check and told me to take care of myself. My ex also gave me everything she stole from me back thinking it'd help her case. So I don't need to work for probably the next 2 years and I'm going to rent my own apartment and just pay rent for the year in advance and then quit my job for awhile and figure out what I truly want to do in my life. 

My ex is probably reading these as she keeps tabs on this Reddit account. I appreciate all the advice I have been given. I still miss her. I still love her. I still feel empty. If you guys can give any advice on where to go from here I'd appreciate it.


Honestly I'm a bit scared at what she may have planned next. I don't know how far she will go to win against me or whatever she's trying to do. I hope she doesn't try anything serious but until court is over and they are roaming free I do fear for my safety.

I'm probably also going to hire a financial adviser for myself. And get their input on what I should do here. Honestly I may or may not quit. I might need to because of the baby. I make good money but I want to be there for my kid and I also want all my finances in order so it's best to hire someone especially with me being this young I'm nervous to have this amount of money. I don't want to lose it.",relationship_advice
"My gf (24f) and I (25m) have been together for 6 years, recently she suggested that we open up our relationship because she wants the excitement of guys flirting with her again.","When she initially brought the subject up two weeks ago I told her that I wasn't comfortable with the idea which she responded with ""I still love you and want to be with you but if you don't want this then we should break up."" 

We talked about it some more and when I asked her that if it was just going to be flirting or if she was planning on sleeping with anyone she said that if it happens it happens. After hours of trying to figure things out I reluctantly agreed because I didn't want to lose her as I planned on proposing on our anniversary in February. I found out later the same night, after she told me, that she has had two dating apps on her phone for a couple weeks already and that she's already been ""talking"" to guys. I told her again that I wasn't comfortable with the whole thing and I especially wasn't ok with her sleeping with other guys.

Last night I asked if she wanted to fool around as our intimate life has been basically non-existent for the past month (not for a lack of trying on my part it's just that's she's never in the mood or tired) and was met with a very enthusiastic ""sure!"" followed by "" after that I'm going to go see a friend."" I was immediately turned off because I knew she meant another guy and I started getting ready to go to sleep as I worked early in the morning. She proceeded to get ready and left at 11pm. It's now 5am and I'm leaving for work and she just got home and went straight to the washroom.

I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who gave helpful advice, I'm still reading through everything and more keep coming. I feel like I should clarify some things.

Yes, I agreed to open our relationship against better judgement because I didn't want to lose her. That meant I was able to see other people too but I choose not to because I only wanted to be with her and I made that clear to her.

Despite the facts that she's had dating apps for awhile and spent time (a few hours here and there, last night was the longest) at a guy's house, she insists that nothing happened and that they're just friends who flirt with eachother... that's it.

Edit 2: Forgot to add - STD's aren't a worry, for me anyways, we both got tested last month as regular checkups and were both clear and we haven't done anything since.",relationship_advice
Girlfriend's parents say I embarrassed them by teaching their daughter. Time to go ?,"Long story short, my girlfriend has already been heavily spoiled by her parents and the tonnes of pathetic chasers that are willing to do anything for her like a queen, before we were together. I just didn't realise it would be this bad.

So to sum up, recently it was her birthday, and she literally nagged and nitpicked everything, from the restaurant (tables without table cloth, curtains not good, waiters not smart enough, food not good, plates not pretty, air conditioner too cold, too many people, too noisy, there's mosquitoes which will bite her), to the cake, to the gift, to the location of the restaurant (the fact that we have to walk a while to get up here, like literally 10 mins, but she's wearing high heels so I can relate).

Since we were eating with her parents, she has been throwing these moods at me all the way when we were walking from the station, all the way even when we sat down, and she continued to sulk and threw tantrums about all the things mentioned above, in front of her parents.

She even began saying shit like; next time, I'll arrange the birthday celebration myself. Can't really trust you. Right, next year you probably ain't here too, no worries. 

That moment I kept controlling myself to talk back and kept saying: it's okay. I'll do better...etc, but I could no longer take this crap anymore (she's been acting like this back then, not just on the birthday, but today I've opened my eyes wide). I spoke up to her and reasoned with her. I said: I planned everything for you since I love you, and the least thing you could do is appreciate ? How do you think it makes me feel if you keep saying those things ? I have emotions too. 

And then she started crying and said I'm abusing her and embarrassing her in front of her parents. Her parents seemed cool and they should know their daughter well, so they just defused the situation.

Now day's over. Once they're back home, they love to have these family discussions. My girlfriend called me that night and said: I'm very disappointed. You embarrassed me and thrashed my party. Now I'll forever remember this 2xth birthday every year. And my parents said you embarrassed them too because it feels like you're helping them to teach their daughter, implying they don't know how to teach her.

Man....am I just new to this world? What's up with these ?

Oh and an update: she thinks I have bipolar syndrome since I normally wouldn't talk back and suddenly does. Also, she thinks I'm evil and has been plotting this for a long time to destroy her birthday....she said no one has ever talked to her like this before and I have a lot of guts.",relationship_advice
"UPDATE/Solved - My wife has started ""acting sexier"" since the marriage - I want to support her but am slightly concerned","This is reference to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cewbfe/my\_wife\_has\_started\_acting\_sexier\_since\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cewbfe/my_wife_has_started_acting_sexier_since_the/) 

Hi All,

Thanks for most people's perspectives. I figured it didn't make sense to wait, so I called up my brother in law (i.e. wife's sister's hubby) to chat. My wife and her sister and absolute best friends in the world, so I thought BIL might have some insight. My wife has been talking to and spending time with her sister a lot recently, which is not uncommon, but it seemed a bit out of the ordinary.

My BIL said that my SIL has been pretty depressed and sad/jealous since my wedding. She's said some things like ""now the perfect couple can have the perfect life"" (directed at us) and saying things like ""50% of marriages end up in divorce, I wonder who we know will be first"" (directed at no one in particular). They also went out shopping, and the thong purchases were from that trip. My BIL has talked to my SIL about the jealousy and sadness, and I guess she is exploring some therapy options. SIL has been in a horrible job situation recently as well.

I have always loved my SIL, but I know she had some relationship trust issues in the past and I think she might be (accidentally or on purpose, I don't really know) planting some seeds in my wife's mind about being hesitant to settle down (but after 7 years? weird...).

After talking to BIL, I brought it back up with my wife very gently. She did tell me that SIL told her things like ""you know, after marriage you need to keep your game up - what if he leaves? You'd have nothing."" That type of thing. My wife said she just mostly ignored these things but can now see that her personality might have been starting to change. She stayed with her sister for a while when I was working out of state, and she said they read of lot of cosmo type stuff (which my wife is not usually a fan of) and went shopping where my SIL bought my wife some new sexier dresses.

It's a tough situation because I honestly thing my wife loves my SIL just as much as she loves me, so it must be a bit confusing. At least I got my wife to admit something might be changing, and I am almost certain I know the source now. I think we're in the clear - my wife and I have dealt with some strife in our relationship early on because of her sister, so this is something we can deal with!

Thanks!",relationship_advice
My [34M] wife [28F] wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend,"When my wife and I met, she had broken up with her boyfriend almost a year prior. We went on a couple of dates until I noticed she slowly stopped talking to me. I found out she had gotten back with her boyfriend. We remained friendly since we would run into each other at the gym (that's how we met). A year later, they break up. I decided to go for it again and asked her out. She was pretty upfront about him and I learned that they have been off-and-on for almost four years. She left him because he started to get abusive.

We get married a little over a year later. A few months later, she gets pregnant.

Last week, I was sitting in the kitchen studying until I heard my wife yell out, crying. I ran over to her to ask her what was wrong. She had difficulty speaking, but, she eventually showed me a post on facebook that a mutual friend between her and her ex had posted. Her ex had gotten into a motorcycle accident and had died.

My wife was/is an avid motorcyclist who stopped riding once she got pregnant. She knew how passionate he was about motorcycle riding just as much as her and how tragic it is.

I console my wife and help her get to bed, letting her know that I'm here for her.

I didn't think much about the whole thing until my wife told me last night that she wants to name our baby after him. I hesitated for a bit and told her that I feel uncomfortable with it. For one, it's her ex. Second, he was abusive. Why would she want to honor someone like that?

My wife got pretty upset and just wouldn't hear me out on my reasons. She won't talk to me at all.

Am I really in the wrong here? I'm just thinking that my wife is extremely emotional at the moment since she's pregnant and trying to process he ex's death.

Any advice?

TLDR: My wife's abusive ex-boyfriend died and she wants to name our baby after him. I don't. Now, she's mad at me.",relationship_advice
My [20/M] girlfriend [19/F] has an incest fetish and wants me to pretend that she's my sister during sex,"
During sexy times tonight, she told me that she had a deep and dark secret that she wanted to tell me, so I asked her what she was talking about and she told me - she has an incest fetish. She told me that she wants me to roleplay with her and pretend that she's my sister while we're having sex. I was really weirded out by this and it kind of ruined the mood for me.

I was feeling particularly weirded out with this because I have a sister who isn't much younger than her that shares very similar facial features with my gf, so what I'm trying to say is, they look kind of alike. They joke all the time that they could be related, which admittedly doesn't help me feel better about this situation.

What makes things even worse is that my sister and girlfriend are pretty good friends, so they share makeup and hair ideas with each other. My girlfriend wears pretty much the same style of makeup that my sister wears and recently she also dyed her hair the same color as my little sister, so that make them look even more similar. I feel like if I were to go through with this, I'd feel like I'm having sex with my actual little sister.

Is this fetish super weird? Am I overreacting for feeling weirded out by this? Do you think I can become comfortable with it? How should I talk to her about this?",relationship_advice
My (f25) Boyfriend (m29) hates my job.,"My boyfriend hates my job. I work as an Animator and he never really talks about it and the rare times he does he never has anything nice to say about it. When I was in uni studying animation he always made fun of how I would never get a job either and made fun of me. I was fine with it back then but after 5 years it has honestly made me resent him. Animation is a large part of my life that he just ignores.

He wont even watch an animated show or movie. An example is when into the spiderverse came out. We both love super hero films but he refused to even give it a chance because it was an animation so I had to go alone.

A recent thing we have discussed which I think has been the tipping point for me, is that I should become a SAHM while he works, nothing against SAHMs but I am not willing to put a job I am so passionate about and have worked so hard for aside so that I can look after a child. TBH I dont even know how he thought that was a reasonable idea considering he has never been able to hold down  job since I met him.

Is this just me over reacting, or is this something I should be worried about?",relationship_advice
I [27F] caught my eight year old niece trying to breastfeed her baby brother. Apparently it's something she does to stop him from crying when my sister [32F] leaves them by themselves,"My sister has an eight year old daughter and a five month old baby. I was at my parents' house and my sister and her boyfriend came by with the kids. They stayed for a little then went somewhere but left the kids. I heard the baby crying and went to check on him and saw my niece with her shirt pulled down and holding him to her chest. I took him from her and asked her what she was doing. She said she was trying to make him happy. I told her not to do that because that's something only her mother should do. She said she does it when her mom isn't home. I asked how often does her mom leave them by themselves. She said a lot.

We confronted my sister when she came back and she got mad. She thinks an eight year old is old enough to stay home alone. She says she fixes some food and bottles before she leaves. My niece just does the breastfeed thing to comfort him because it's what she has seen my sister do. My sister doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. My parents were furious. She snapped and said if we are so concern then why don't we just take them. My mom hit back saying that we didn't birth them therefore we aren't the ones who should have to take care of them. She took the kids and left.

No contact since. We're worried about the kids. We don't want to call CPS but we don't know what else we can do.",relationship_advice
My sister's boyfriend[24] of 7 years sexually assaulted me[18],"Hi, I am really new to Reddit but I needed somewhere to vent because I literally can't turn to anyone. 

My sister has been dating this guy for a long time and everyone (including myself at one point) thought they were perfect for each other. He is super caring of her and I can definitely tell he loves her and she loves him. I am also dating a guy and it's been a year and a half and I love him to bits and he loves me the same too. 

I am close to him but he always felt like an older brother to me. He is funny, smart and everyone loves talking to him. My family, my boyfriend all love him as well, we all have a close relationship with him. My sister and him live together in an apartment but a few months ago she started visiting our house again and they would stay over and she would go to Uni or work and come back later that day.

Him and I would just chill on the lounge watching movies or talk or play games. We have done it many times before in the past and it was enjoyable and fun because my parents are usually never home and I get lonely sometimes (my boyfriend can't come over often since he lives quite far). 

One day we were on the couch, (we usually keep our distance, we sit on opposite sides) and he was sitting right next to me. I kept to the corner of the couch and we were just having banter and telling jokes like we usually would. But everytime I made a joke, he would tickle me and touch me in a very different way which I could tell. At first I tried not to think much of it and told myself I was overthinking. But then he had his hand on my thigh and I just froze. I didn't know what to think because I never thought I would be ever stuck in this situation. He kept rubbing his hand up and down my thighs and I felt sick to my stomach but I didn't know what to say. All of a sudden my sister called to tell us she was coming home and he immediately stopped and I got up to go the bathroom. I was frozen for a good 5 minutes and I had to process everything that just had happened. Another few instances was I could obviously tell he was checking out my body. I am relatively short and small but my chest somehow is relatively large for my body size and I try to hide it most times because it makes me feel uncomfortable as I know many random guys in public make comments about it or obviously check me out. I rarely ever wear low cut tops because of this yet my sister's boyfriend has quite obviously checked them out if we are ever close to each other. 

Anyway, this happened again, however this time my sister was here too. She had a day off and we all chilled on the couch. He sat in the middle while my sister and I were on each side. I somehow fell asleep during the movie and as I woke, I could feel he was touching my butt under the blanket. More like caressing. My sister was there and he was still doing this. I pretended to be asleep because I had no idea what was going on or what I should've done. This went on for about 10 minutes before my boyfriend called and I pretended to wake up.

Then the dreaded day happened. We were chilling again as per usual. I made sure to keep my distance and try my best to keep normal because I wasn't sure of what was happening. I have major anxiety so my mind was always racing. He somehow edged so close to me and was touching my thighs. I felt so so so so so uncomfortable but nothing would come out of voice because I was so so afraid. He ended up caressing my entire body and pushed open my legs as I tried my best to focus on the movie. He kept trying to get me to look at him and kiss him but I kept my face towards the tv. He also ended up touching me down there and almost fingering before my sister ended up calling. I kept my face normal (I have major depression as well, so faking is really easy for me) and waited until the left to go home. I broke down crying and crying and crying because I couldn't believe what just happened. I had never felt so unbelievably disgusted and dirty and ashamed. I hated it so much that I didn't even say anything. But I literally had no idea what to say. I feel so extremely guilty because I love love love love my boyfriend. But if I tell family, I feel like this would ruin everything and I feel like my whole family will just break. Especially my sister and my boyfriend. It's hurts me the most that I can't tell my boyfriend but it literally eats me alive. We are going so perfectly well but I feel as if I'm slowly detoriating and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so so so lost but I absolutely can't say anything to anyone.

I messaged him a few days later telling him how disgusted I was with him and that I honestly never wanted to have anything to do with him again, but that I would have to for the sake of my family and my sister(my sister also has issues and I think she would literally break if she found out) he apologized and said how sorry he was and ever since then, if we ever see each other we avoid each other,  but not enough that people notice. 

Please please please give me advice on how to get over this and become stronger because I literally am so lost and hurt and sad. I've been crying for a good few months now. I even considered breaking up with my boyfriend because he doesn't deserve such a broken girl like me. I wish I told someone but also am too afraid for the aftermath and how it would affect everyone. So please tell me how to get over this... It kills me everyday. I love my boyfriend so much, I wish this never happened. Please help.",relationship_advice
My husband cheated on me with a teenager. It happened to me.,"Hello everyone. I was googling about my ordeal and I came across this site so decided to sign up and ask for advice. Thank you to everyone who will answer.

I am 43 years old, my husband turns 50 in 8 days. We have been married for 17 years and we have two daughters aged 16 and 9.

I am a mess. I haven't been able to do anything ever since I found out 3 days ago. My younger girl thinks I'm sick because I've called in sick at work and I've been in bed most of the time. My older one knows something is up but I can't bear to tell her what it really is.

My husband has gone to visit his father in order to give me some space to think. Immediately after finding out I thought of getting a divorce but then I thought of the children, particularly my younger girl. I don't want to raise her in a dysfunctional family especially since shes very close to her father. But my husband repulses me now. If I think of him at all I see red. I thought he was happy. I would have sex with him 3 times a week when I didn't want to. And then he goes to repeatedly sleep with a girl his daughter's age over a 2 month period, behind my back, thinking I'd never find out. 

I need ways to cope if you can suggest them. And reassurance that I'm doing the right thing for my children by staying. Thank you.",relationship_advice
I'm [46M] having a hard time accepting that my son [21M] is gay. Can you guys help me?,"My son recently came out to my wife and I. He sat us down on our living room couch and told us he had to tell us something. He asked us if he could tell us anything? We said of course. He then asked us would we always love him? We said always, no matter what. He then told me, ""I'm gay."" That shocked me. His mother gave him a big hug and told him, ""That's okay, you're still our son and we will always love you."" I was unresponsive. I'm actually having a hard time accepting that my son is gay. It's not the kind of life I envisioned for him.

My parents always told me growing up that homosexuality is wrong, me and the guys I hung out with would make gay jokes, etc. The way I was brought up makes it hard for me to accept it. And just thinking about what gay men do behind closed doors is very disturbing to me. I don't want people to look down upon me for having a gay son. I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone, I'm just trying to be honest and express my thoughts. I still love my son, I'm just having a hard time coming to grips with his sexuality, which is why I turned to you guys. Can you guys help me or give me advice with accepting my son?

Edit: I just want to say that I am very overwhelmed by all of the comments. Most of you guys have given me great advice. I still love my son and I always will. I agree that it's most important that he's happy. It's just that it's hard to change something that you've been hardwired into believing, but I will try my best to change my views if it means I can have a relationship with my son. I will definitely talk to my son and tell him that I love him and that I accept him. Thank you all for the great advice, it's much appreciated.",relationship_advice
Scared to tell my (24M) girlfriend (27F) that I was raped.,"I have a good relationship with my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. We live together and love each other very much. We have overcome difficult circumstances before, and I think we can overcome this, but I'm terrified to tell her.

I recently went on a trip out of state. I stayed in a hostel close to some bars. In my room was 2 young men and one older woman, in her 40s. I introduced my self to all of them I went out to the bars that night with the guys I had met, who were great company. The lady from our dorm went her own way. 

Later that night, I got very drunk. I texted my new friends after we got separated to let them know I was on my way back to the hostel. On my way back, I see the older woman from our hostel sitting on the curb. I'm slurring my words at this point, but asked her if she was ok and wanted to walk back to the hostel with me, about 8 blocks away. This is where my memory after leaving the bar became very hazy. I remember her being overjoyed to see me. I remember her complimenting me but though nothing of it.

The next morning I woke up feeling like absolute trash. Sick, cold and nauseas. Still a little drunk. Barely remembering the details of the previous night. My roommates are passed out and the lady is checked out.  We all slept til 3 p.m.; occasionally I got out of bed to throw up.

I talked to my roommates when we woke up and they were giggling and complimenting me. I didn't understand why, and asked them what they meant. That's when they told me that they saw me with the lady on top of me when they came back to the room last night. I instantly felt way sicker and a rush of anxiety overcame my body. I didn't remember that night, but I remember that I had no intention to have sex with anyone, especially an older woman. I didn't consent to whatever we had done, i didn't want her to mount me, I didn't go out looking for sex, I know I wasn't turned on or erect, I feel that I was raped. 

I was scared of so much at this point; STDs, pregnancy, ect. I really cannot recall what happened, but I know my intent when I came back was clear: I did not want to have sex. I debated getting the police or my hostel involved and still sort of want to, but I know from my first conversation that we were all from out of state. I feel that there's no point in getting the law involved now. 

What I'm terrified about is telling my girlfriend. I got an STD test 5 days after and I'm clear, but I'm scared she won't believe me because I am a man who was assaulted by a woman. I think she will think I cheated on her and intentionally looked for this, and it breaks my heart and terrified me. I don't know what to do, or how to bring this up, but I feel like I need to tell her. How would you bring this conversation about. 

TLDR:

Went on vacation. Possibly had sex with a woman I didn't want to while I was blacked out drunk. Scared to tell girlfriend because I think she'll call me a liar.",relationship_advice
UPDATE - I need to tell my wife that I know she has been cheating on me and that I want a divorce but she has severe anxiety and panic attacks.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/90pam5/40m\_i\_need\_to\_tell\_my\_wife\_that\_i\_know\_she\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/90pam5/40m_i_need_to_tell_my_wife_that_i_know_she_has/)

I decided to wait a bit to tell her in order to carefully think about what to say and when to say it. This was a good decision on my part as it gave me time for the anger to fade and logic to begin. When I told her she was in shock, apologised for everything, and cried...no panic attacks. I was surprised that she thought she would never get caught. She thought it was just a phase. She never wanted to split up. She was very upset about not seeing my family again, going on family vacations, and her fear of being an old ugly lady with no one to love her. I had to push myself to not feel bad for her. I am not ready to forgive her.  Thank goodness this is a problem that was not my fault. It feels good to know that. 

She does not like the idea of a divorce, but understands that is the consequence of her mistake. We talked for the next few days on how to divide up everything, made a timeline for separation, and talked about how to divide the time exactly 50% with our child. We were both very professional and realistic. We have been best friends for the last 10+ years and done a good job of working together, so this was not surprise. Our main problem was the bedroom and romance aspect.

I am glad I ignored the people on her that wanted me to act all ""fire and brimstone"" on her, kick her out, get lawyers, etc...  There were a few calm, realistic and logical people that helped me. Thanks! Eventually we will need lawyers, but my hope is that everything is taken care of by us first. 

From here the hardest part if for me is that I want to forget the affair occurred and keep things the same and easy. I keep reminding myself of the future pain and suffering if we do not separate. I will never trust her again. I am certain she will cheat again. My son will be better off with divorced parents that are happy than miserable cheating parents.  I hope this is true. The alternative is to stay in a marriage that is simply two parents living in the same house with no expectation to help each other out physically or emotionally, but we both see our son everyday.",relationship_advice

She has an (alleged) distaste for gambling so she wanted nothing of it. Just drop off, I met a couple friends, and spent a couple of hours doing slots.

I ended up leaving with around CAD$3500 more than I came in with. I told my girlfriend and she flat out said I need to give her half because she drove me, and since we've been together for so long, it should be 50/50 split in any case. I wanted to use these to pay off the final remainder of my school loans with some leftover to treat her for a nice dinner and maybe a new piece of furniture.

The short of it is she refused to pick me up and we had a huge fight. It's been a few hours now and it hasn't really calmed down. She's not home (I own the house completely) and won't respond to texts.

On one hand, I feel guilty she got so angry but I also think this is pretty stupid and telling of her character. I think I'm done. I'm not in the wrong, right? We don't share our finances, and in most respects, she's more well off than I. I inherited this house but otherwise work. My girlfriend gets a trust every month and ultimately makes more than I do.

tl;dr: I won $3500 at the casino. Girlfriend demands half of it. Am I obliged to put up with it?

He's coming out,"UPDATE; we have decided to stay together in the home and remain friends but will be separating 

Husband and I have been together since we were 14, we are 25 now married for three years with a daughter  and he's a great father 

He's the best husband, he cooks, he cleans, he irons, he makes sure me and our daughter are happy, he works hard and is overall perfect 

He's been stressed out lately and I finally confronted him and asked 

He told me that he can't hide it anymore and that he's gay, all the worlds left my mind and I don't know what to say - he said he didn't want to leave me and didn't want me to leave unless I'll be happy and he'll still be able to see our daughter as often and that mine and our daughters happiness comes over his own all the time without a doubt.

So, do I stay with him? I want to stay with him but I can't force him to stay with me, I love him I really do and I wanna stay",relationship_advice
Update- My (28f) boyfriend (32m) promised me a fish tank for my birthday. He got me sea monkeys.,"So I got next to no replies, but I'm still seething so I'm going to go ahead and vent here. 

I legitimately thought it was a joke. A bad one, but I seriously thought he couldn't be that fucking dense. Well.

I talked to him. He didn't want to get me a tank because it would cost more money than the sea monkeys and he'd spent all his cash on weed. He didn't want to charge something full price from the store  to his card, and didn't have cash for a used tank from Craigslist. He thought I'd buy that it was a compromise, apparently. 

I'm already moved back in with my mother. I literally linked him nice used tanks for $50. He didn't have a spare $50 to get me something nice because he fucking bought weed instead. 

I bought myself a 46 gallon bowfront that I'm going to fill with all sorts of cool fish and he can go suck a dick. I'm done. 

Tl;Dr he bought me a $8 child's toy instead of the modest tank I'd asked for because he wasted his money on weed again. I moved out.

Edit: To top it off his boss just texted me to apologize if their 'relationship' is what broke us up and she's so sorry but it just happened and they love each other and she's sorry I got hurt while they figured that out. I just emailed HR. I don't need this drama. Thank fucking god I already left and brought all my stuff with me. ",relationship_advice

I [M/31] Just caught my girlfriend (now ex)[F/32] redhanded cheating on me with her ex.,"Needless to say I'm crushed.  I felt something was about 4 months ago, sex diminished greatly (we had sex 4 times in the last 4 months) she seemed more distant, she would get mad at me over petty things, she was a hawk over her phone, she would randomly stop texting me some night and tell me the next day she fell asleep.  We are talking 730-830 PM ""falling asleep"". The straw that broke the camel's back was this past Sunday she said she was setting boundaries and she wanted one day to herself a week when she doesnt have her kid.  She also said she'd let me pick the day so I felt comfortable with it. 
That felt really weird to me. 
Tonight, she came over and left early saying she had a headache.
About 20 minutes after she left a friend called me and said he by random chance saw her pulling into another guys driveway (friend knew where she lived and that a guy lived at the house she pulled into, small town).
He gave me the address and I immediately left my house.  
I arrived, banged on the door, no answer, bang again,  no answer.  Finally.... her ex answers the door... in his underwear.
I asked, ""is kendra here?"" He responds, ""yes, who are you?""
I reply, ""her fucking boyfriend, did you know about this?""
He said he didnt know.
I said, ""if you knew about this, then you two deserve each other, if not then I'm sorry you had to find out this way.""
Turned around and left.

I'm so heartbroken.  I thought when I met her that I'd be able to trust someone finally. 6/6 of my exes have cheated on me.  That's not assumed, its confirmed.  They've either admitted it, or I've caught them.

I'm so lost.  I'm to the point where I believe everyone cheats.  I dont know what's wrong with me.  I feel so worthless and low.  I dont know what I need to fix to make people stop cheating on me, I've tried so hard to figure it out.  I feel ugly and hopeless.

The last things I've texted her since I went there were, ""You're a worthless piece of shit."" 
""How can someone be so nice to your face while they stab you in the back"". (That was something she told me just a few days prior talking about her ex cheating on her with prostitutes) You're a joke.
Thank you for destroying any trust I'll ever have in a human.  You're fucking scum.""

That was probably too much.  I'm not gonna say anything else to her, there's no point, I doubt she cares enough to respond.

I'm so broken right now, I dont think I can ever trust another person, I'm pretty sure every person cheats.

[UPDATE 2] (24m) Should I tell my gf that I used to do gay for pay porn?,"I wanted to follow up on a post I did a while ago on here because you all gave some good advice. tl;dr version is I did a few gay for pay porn scenes a few years ago and wasn't sure if i should tell my current gf or not. thanks to everyone who responded and gave their thoughts. i decided honesty is the best policy and spilled my guts. she was definitely surprised and took a while to process things. she had a lot of questions (how did i get into it, had i been with guys before that, did i use protection, etc) but was actually surprisingly accepting. she actualy asked if she could see the scenes, which i was really not sure about at first, but i figured i might as well. she laughed a little bc they're super corny but she was totally cool about it! since then, we've both talked about exploring our bi sides more together and have been on a few things with other couples! she admitted that she never thought i'd be willing to do something like that until i told her about my past. honesty turned out to be the best policy! thanks everyone!",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Asking my stepdad if I can call him ""dad""","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6akbi/i_f_am_considering_asking_my_stepdad_if_i_can/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Ok, so it's been a while, but I did get asked for updates on the original. I'm a chicken, so I haven't done this yet, but I finally have a plan!

I'm in grad school. I was at the school bookstore today and I saw a t-shirt that said ""[university]"" with the mascot on it. Next to it was an identical t shirt that said ""[university] dad."" I bought the plain one in my size and the dad one in my stepdad's size. 

I have previously told him that I won't be able to visit him and my mom this summer because of school stuff. The plan is that on father's day I'm going to drive there as a surprise. I'm going to be wearing my t shirt. Some back story: I've been talking for a few months about getting university apparel, but, you know, grad school stipend. Licensed apparel is absurdly overpriced. So, anyway, I'll be wearing my shirt when I drive up. I'm going to ask him if he likes my new shirt. When he (hopefully) says yes, I'm going to pull out his shirt and say, ""good, because I got you one to match!""

Do you like this idea? Is this stupid? I'm so nervous. Ugh.",relationship_advice
My MIL tampered with my birth control resulting in me getting pregnant 3mo postpartum. Not really sure what to do from here.,"Let me just start out by saying if you know who I am, please don't say anything. I created a throwaway to vent and cry and get support as anonymously as possible. I'm still very happy about the pregnancy, or at least want to be. I just need support. Thanks for understanding. 

My husband (22m) and I (20f) welcomed our daughter into the world 18 weeks ago. She's a darling baby and really pretty easy as far as new borns go, except for one: she wasn't a son. My ILs were obsessed with the idea of us having a son, to the point that they denied she was a girl up until the moment she was born. Why? Because, ""the bloodline follows the father. If you don't have a son, our family name will die out, because your daughter will marry a man and carry on *his* bloodline. So girls don't really count."" The day they came to visit in the hospital, my ILs asked when we would be trying for another baby. We kind of just laughed it off, but my MIL got more insistent, straight up telling us ""y'all need to try for a boy!"" 

Over the next month or two the conversation about us having another baby sort of tapers off into little comments every now and again. I had no problem ignoring them, and we'd already told them it wasn't happening so I just let it run off my back. Around this time, MIL started coming over daily for a few hours, watching the baby for me so that I could sleep and also occasionally clean up a bit for me. She'd be over unsupervised anywhere from 1 - 4hrs. 

Fast forward to present day. Two days ago now, my husband poured me a mixed drink, and when I brought the cup up to my lips, I got hit with this paranoid and panicked feeling. I immediately put the cup down and insisted we take a pregnancy test. Sure enough, it comes back positive. We wait until the next morning, take a digital test and again, positive. Based on LMP I should have been about 6 weeks along. After getting over the initial shock, we were excited but confused. For several reasons, we hadn't been able to get hormonal birth control, so we'd been using condoms and lube to make sure they didn't tear. So we weren't sure how we'd gotten pregnant, but we're happy with the news. We decided we wouldn't tell anyone because we didn't want another baby stampede from his family, but I'm incredibly close with my SIL so I decided to tell her after swearing her to secrecy. 

When I told her, her yes got wide and started to water and she asked if I was serious, and was I sure. I told her I know my husband and I are young, but between us we make more than enough to support another baby. SIL bursts into tears and starts to apologize over and over, meanwhile I sit there with my mouth hanging open and lost. She calms down a bit, and through her tears tell me that *my MIL has been poking holes in our condoms pretty much since we came home from the hospital*. She claims MIL told her she did it, but she thought that she was just spouting shit because she was upset we didn't have a boy. And suddenly everything clicked into place. That's why the condoms didn't work even though we were careful with them. That's why she'd always shoo me off to sleep while she was around. And that's what she was doing when she was ""cleaning"" my house - snooping for our condoms. And she knew I wasn't on birth control because I remember complaining to her about how my OB went on maternity leave and I wasn't able to find another one that took my insurance at the time. 

I'm so angry I don't know what to do. I want to go right over to her house and tear her a new one so bad I can smell my tires burning in the blacktop. I'm also illogically angry at SIL for not telling me - how could you think this was a joke when she was so specific about everything she was going to do?! Why didn't you warn me? I would have put my condoms in my room. I'm livid with MIL. I'm pleased with this pregnancy but it wasn't my choice. It wasn't even an accident, it was her meddling because she didn't get the Golden Grandson she wanted. I don't even know how to handle this. I want to scorch the earth but I also still don't want his family knowing I'm pregnant. And I'm not even 12 weeks yet so the risk of a miscarriage is still uncomfortably high. The only bright side of this whole thing is it's snatched my husband out of his mothers FOG so violently he's probably got whiplash. Personally, my pregnancy has soured a bit so I'm really trying to hang on to any happiness I have about the pregnancy left. If you have Irish Twins of your own or are one, I'd love some positive feedback on that situation. 

Where do we go from here?

ETA Update:

First, let me clarify: I am 20yrs old, not eighteen. I'm 18 weeks postpartum, not 12. 12 is when I would have conceived given that I'm 6 weeks along based on LMP. Second, I don't give a shit if you think this is fake, I honestly wish that it were. If you don't have advice to give I kindly ask that you take your judgement elsewhere. 

Now that that's out the way, here's the update:

I want to thank you all for your support and suggestions. Having a plan makes me feel way less panicked and overwhelmed. Sadly, what MIL did isn't a crime here, so there won't be any jail time of charges pressed. For now, game plan is NC with MIL for me, babe, or growing babe once the truth is out. Before then, I want all the proof in the world she did this. I've ordered a hidden camera, and am going to buy new, latex free condoms claiming that I'm suddenly allergic to latex. Hopefully she'll poke holes again and I'll have video proof this time. Even if I can't use it to press charges, I want all the proof I have that she's not safe to be around so she can't sue for GPR if this baby *is* a boy. I also have decided to change our family last name to literally anything else bc I'm a petty bitch and since she wants to act an ass over this stupid name, then nobody gets it. As for my husband, he's willing and ready to do whatever I decide. Currently he's asleep, so we'll be discussing everything at breakfast. Thanks again everyone.",relationship_advice
I (22M) was sexually assaulted by a girl at a party and my girlfriend (23F) walked in on it happening - she broke up with me after slapping me in the face and now I am devastated,"** Update: thanks everyone for the kindness and support. I have made an appointment with my schools counseling center and they said that they can definitely hear me out and help me present my case to the appropriate school authorities. **

——————————————————————

Hi. I am a 22M senior year in college. My girlfriend is a 23F in grad school at the same university.

We have been dating for six months and everything was going well or so I thought.

Over the weekend, we both attended a party and got quite a bit drunk.

At one point I got up to go to the bathroom, and another woman followed me into the bathroom and started forcing herself on me.

I tried to make her stop but she whispered in my ear ""if you scream, I will tell them that you raped me now shut the fuck up"".

I began crying but she proceeded to do things to me which I never wanted to do with anyone, ever. And I never wanted to be forced.

After a few minutes (or eternity whichever is longer), my girlfriend went to find me and three open the the bathroom door to find me being assaulted.

Her first instinct was to scream, which attracted a crowd. My rapist/assailant, backed away and like a deer in headlines, gasped and pointed to me and said ""he started it!"".

At that point my girlfriend tried to kick my testicles but thankfully I protected them but then she immediately smacked my face while I was busy protecting my crotch.

Then she ran out of the party and texted me ""never fucking talk to me again ever scumbag and if you do I will get the police involved""

I tried responding back that I did not chose what happened and that I was a victim not the instigator but she doesn't believe me at all.

I went to the campus public safety office and they tried to ask me questions as if I was the person doing the sexual assaulting. I ended up leaving before I got in trouble myself. 

I'm fucking devasted and don't know where to turn. She fucking hates my guts and thinks that I tried to seduce or assault another woman when really it is the opposite of what actually happened.",relationship_advice
"My boyfriend (21M) is well-off and travelling, while I'm (20F) broke, stuck in shit conditions and struggling to put food on my plate. It's making me feel pathetic and worthless, and it's getting increasingly difficult to be happy for him. Help?","We've been together for a year, been best friends for 3 years before that. My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family while mine has always been quite poor. I love him and care about him a lot and I have never been jealous of his wealth, I've always paid for my own things and haven't/don't expect him to pay for me.

However recently things have been especially tough for me, I live alone as I have no other options and am a student, due to certain circumstances (sick family member, debt and a few other things) life has been EXTREMELY difficult for me recently. I work when I'm not studying and come home late in the night, then rush to college in the morning, rince and repeat. Almost everything I earn goes to pay the rent and internet (which I need for college). Most of the days I have nothing to eat, and it won't be an exaggeration to say I mostly survive on bread, eggs and ramen noodles. I'm extremely tired, depressed and constantly have suicidal thoughts.

My boyfriend left 2 months ago to travel the EU and take language courses. He constantly sends me pictures of the things he's up to, cliché pics of expensive food, hotels, pools etc. I've always been very excited and happy for him when he's having a good time, but at the moment it's become too much to handle. I know it will probably sound shallow but I don't want to see pictures of him having steak with red wine and everything when my best meal in the last 6 months has been a chicken pie and most of the days I'm just starving.

He knows of my current situation and while I know he isn't trying to mock me, it often feels like it. It's like he's rubbing it in my face, although he isn't doing that deliberately. It still makes me angry at him. I can't keep up a conversation with him anymore because he always disappears mid-conversation and then comes back with a pic of him at a party or something titled ""sorry was afk"", and then disappears again. He makes me feel even more lonely than I already am. I love him but I'm constantly so mad and upset with him. It just hurts so much. I'm miserable and have no idea what to do. I'm losing the only friend and a person that loves me over these feelings and I don't know how to stop them.

Help.

Edit: Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am overwhelmed by the amount of kindness and support people have shown. Thank you for taking the time out of your lives to read my post and for leaving a lot of useful advice and insight. I have read every single comment so far and I have been trying to reply to every comment and I'm so sorry that I haven't responded to all of them.  I've been bawling my eyes out reading them this entire time, I just feel numb right now.

To the people that have messaged me or commented offering to help me with food or money, I am at loss of words. The amount of generosity, kindness, humanity and selflessness you have in your hearts to offer help to a complete stranger has touched my soul beyond describable. 
I hope I do not come off as ungrateful, I cannot possibly put in words how much I appreciate people offering me help, but as I have already replied to some of you, thank you so, so much but I do not want to and won't be taking anything. 

If you know someone in your life that's been struggling with food and basic necessities, please, please offer them the help! I know it will mean the world to them.

Thank you for everything.",relationship_advice
I feel like a terrible husband,"My wife's birthday was yesterday and I had some ideas of where I wanted to take her. However, the days leading up to get birthday she wad adamant about not going anywhere. I kept saying that I wanted to take her out and she kept saying it was a waste of money. I wanted to take her out to a play or a nice restaurant.

On the day of het birthday I asked her to wait for me after work so I can take her somewhere but she said no and not to worry about it. I wanted to do SOMETHING so I went to her favorite restaurant and got her favorite meal for dinner and I bought her a Kindle as an early birthday present. We had a nice night but eventually she basically said while she appreciated everything I did, she wished I did something more meaningful. I felt pretty bad and seeing my hurt upset her and she went to bed really early last night. 

This morning she told me I should have known better and that she would have went out if I set something up. I was upset and called her childish for not being straightforward expecting me to be a mind reader. Maybe I was wrong for saying those things but I was upset. Now I feel bad. She looked sad and isn't talking to me.

I told her to get out, it was like 3 in the morning and she was like I can't i said yes you can get an Uber. I was crying and We were a.l still pretty drunk so it got really heated.

We argued and  he kept apologising and I said I'm going to bed and we'll talk in the morning. 

He's still asleep. 

I'm feeling like I should break up with him but I don't know. I don't think a threesome is the same as them two having sex. He went behind my back and betrayed me and I just feel really hurt

She (36/F) broke something I (37/M) built in my free time. I am still sad about this and having trouble moving past it.,"TL;DR at top: got into a huge argument with the wife, went out to do a chore she asked me to do, came back to a project destroyed. Feeling really sad and want to move past it. 

Most nights when my wife comes home, she doesn't even talk to me. She immediately gets on her phone and binge watches yet another series. She's able to live on far less sleep than me, so she can stay up for hours watching Netflix and I only really have 45 minutes or an hour where I'm awake that we can do anything. 

I asked her what she's watching and commented that I wish I could be part of the shows she watches, or just offer occasionally to watch one of her shows with me. This gets into a huge, screaming fight where she tells me that I say she never does anything for me. I just keep trying to reiterate that she lives her whole life around binge watching and I'm ok with her having her own thing, but it'd be nice to be included occasionally.

I had to run out and do a chore that she asked me to do because she was too tired. She called me when I was out and told me she broke something, I couldn't understand her and she wouldn't pick up the phone after she hung up on me. 

In my very limited free time between kids, work, and her, I was trying to build an enclosure for my 3D printer, just to keep the heat in and the draft out. Nothing fancy, frankly it wasn't special, and all I did was the wood framing and I had the panels cut to attach to the sides and to make the door. But it was something I made. She smashed it with a hammer.

I honestly wanted to cry. I know that isn't a manly thing to admit to, but life has been difficult lately. To condense it a little, I am not even remotely successful in my professional life, personal life, or family life, and it's depressing. These little projects are sometimes the only thing that makes me feel like I'm doing something in my life correctly. Even if it's some small, relatively meaningless thing. 

It's the next morning and we're past the apologies at this point, and she ""apologized"" for that, but immediately said it should've been something more valuable like the actual 3D printer or my laptop (something I worked 50+ hours of overtime for weeks to earn), so it doesn't feel like an apology as much as it feels like a threat of future property destruction. 

So honestly I'm really sad about it. I don't really feel angry about it, I just feel really sad. It logically doesn't contribute much to anything especially in the shape it was in, but I worked on it and I was going to work on it. I tried to get her to understand by saying it'd be like if I tore up a page of poetry she wrote, or a short story, or a sewing project, etc - it was something I put my limited amount of time and energy into and it felt good to do it. Now I'm not sure how I'm going to get the motivation to throw it away (it's completely destroyed), much less try to make it again.

To sum it up in a question - is there a trick to feeling better about this sooner? How do I move to the forgiveness part of this? ",relationship_advice
"[24F] Went through a toxic breakup this morning and ringing in 2019 alone with no friends and terrible home life. Need advice on everything, feeling really lost and depressed","EDIT: Truly did not expect this post to take off like this. I am so overwhelmed (in the best way possible) by the immense outpouring of love and support from each and every one of you around the world. I've read every comment, post, message and am trying to reply to every single one but please know all of you have made my 2019 start on the best note possible and I'm so thankful for all of you. Thank you for your advice, support, love, sharing your stories, kindness to a complete stranger. I love you all ❤️

Hi everyone, long time follower of this sub, first time posting using a throwaway. It's 2 hours short of 2019 and I [24F] haven't felt this alone or sad in a long time. I'm sorry in advance this is so long and kind of all over the place but that's kind of just my life recently. 

Went through a breakup this morning with an on-again, off-again guy [27M] I've been seeing since September. We love each other but have a lot of issues and it's been getting increasingly toxic. We've broken up probably 5+ times and this probably sounds so stupid that I keep taking him back but it's really painful and hurts because he's my best friend. I know I just need to stay away but he always tries to reconnect about a week after we end things saying he loves & misses me and things will change, and they do for a few days, but then he goes back to being really distant and canceling plans and messing with my head and making me feel like shit. My New Years resolution is to stop taking him back and cut him out for good. 

Aside from that, I really feel like I don't have any true friends anymore and I even don't know how I got here. My other best friend is an ex - we have been platonic for almost a year now, dated for 1.5 yrs but have been friends since high school. He asked to stop talking for a while because he felt like he still had feelings for me and I don't; I fully understand and respect that. Beyond that I have other acquaintances, mostly from work, but no one I'm really close with. I know the simple solution here is to make more friends but I can't figure out how. I've gone to bars alone more times than I'm willing to admit, fitness classes, hiking, etc - it usually ends up in more acquaintances or hookups just to not feel lonely for the night. And so I've kind of lost interest in trying new things and putting myself out there. Sometimes I go on dating apps just to feel like I have someone to talk to (my matches). 

Lastly, I live at home with my parents because I work nearby and rent here is just outrageous and it just works out, but they're extremely anti-affectionate and always super negative. We've never celebrated a holiday, birthday, special occasion for no particular reason and they've never really been supportive about anything. Always distilling the idea that I'll never be good enough (at my job, to keep a guy, etc). Over this holiday break I've been cooped up at home with nowhere to go and it's constantly dead eerie quiet 24/7 (they don't speak to each other) and just a horrible atmosphere. They're also extremely overprotective and get upset when I go out and need to know every detail of where I'm going, when I'll be back, etc. They put alerts on all credit card and banking activity and insist on shared accounts and what not. 

I've tried therapy but it's always been really discouraging and unsuccessful, and especially today where everyone's celebrating and seems so happy, I've never felt more alone and hopeless. Just seeking words of encouragement and advice from anyone who has been or are currently in my shoes.

We're going to be ok! Better than ok actually!

I wrote this post about a month ago describing our problem: 
https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blqf6e/honestly_not_cheating/ 

My update is this. We're going to be ok, better than ok actually!!
I took some advice from posts here encouraging me to reach out to understand what was motivating her fears and also disregard much advice which encouraged me to walk away.

I reach out to her and we took four weeks from work to reconnect. We went to where we'd met and talked, and talked and talked.  After the emotional dam broke I learned that she had a deep seated feeling that she had failed me as a wife, we'd always planned children and she was completely baffled why a man as ""good as I"" would still love her if she weren't able to have them. She internalized this and despite my view that it's our problem not hers alone she felt a need to own it.

I explained to her that I was amazed that  a woman like her would be content with a man like me and how I still adore her and look forward to ever minute we have. 

Long story we both realized again we each see ourselves as the lucky one in our relationship. This lead to an amazing and really liberating physical playtime, sex without the stress of reproduction just for pure love is AWESOME. 

And drumroll!
We're pregnant!!!!, pictures of the test available on request.

Seasonal Reminder: If your SO is hiding their phone it might just be because they are buying you gifts.,"Just thought some more paranoid people might need this reminder, my boyfriend and I are on a no phone sharing basis ATM because we are purchasing items, getting shipping notifs and texting people about gift advice.

I [22f] can't get something my boyfriend [27m] said out of my head,"I apologize for my brevity, but we're on vacation right now, and this is the first time I've had to myself. Basically, about two months ago, we had a conversation about cheating, because he constantly makes little quips about me being a wh\*re/sl\*t, joking that I'm going to cheat while away at school, and just annoying repetitive jokes like that. It came around to him saying that he thinks if he were to cheat, it wouldn't be a big deal because ""what you don't know can't hurt you."" I tried explaining that cheating even if done ""perfectly"" is still blatantly disrespectful because you're gambling your relationship and your future children's respect. I said some things before that, but that was the thing I said that finally got him to do the ""yes dear, I agree dear"" because he wanted to end the conversation.  The ""jokes"" haven't ended, even though I mention it weekly that it bothers me and is hurtful. And now every time he says it, there's the extra echo in my head of ""what you don't know can't hurt you."" I worry that if I bring this up, he'll start the ""please don't break up with me/I'll break up with you if you're not confident in our relationship"".

Edit: We had to go to a dinner, thank you for all the replies. I'm reading everything now, and I'll try to reply when I can next.

Edit 2: Last night was pretty rough, especially trying to act fine. He kept asking if I was ok, so I'm not sure if he's onto me. This morning I woke up way too early so I had a chance to read replies a bit more and think. I realized just how much my life has changed since I met him. There are some good things, but they're all weirdly scheduled or something, like he rushed to do something nice every time a bad thing happened. I got to thinking about his father, and his father's father, and realized that they both brag about how they purposely found the most shy girls, and that women who speak their minds and aren't selfless (read: self debasing) enough, aren't wife material. 

I'm 99% sure, based on things he and his family have said and done, that he's always planned to do this; the isolating, the mean and hurtful words, the complete lack of positive or helpful sentiments, all to make it easier to do whatever he wanted. And I'm ashamed to say it worked. But not for long.

My plan is to pretend I never figured this out. Then while I'm away at school, I'll make as many friends as possible. Eventually I'll see about finding a part time job, but that will have to be done in secret. I'll put away as much money as I can and avoid spending any of my student loans or grants besides on school.

It's going to take me months to figure out a way out, but I have to. Looking at his mother and grandmother, I can't be like that. That's the worst existence I can think of. Working a full job, then coming home and working another full job cooking and cleaning while he sits around and lectures about how smart he is. The only thing that could possibly change in the future is adding babies.

Thank you for all of your help. If I didn't have someone to turn to, I would have been strung along a lot longer, and the thought makes me cringe. ",relationship_advice
A girl (18F) that I (17M) hooked up with took photos of my penis while I was sleeping and sent it to a group chat of her friends,"Hi everyone. I am a 17 year old guy who is kinda seeing/hooking up with a girl from the HS we both graduated from.

A few nights ago I slept at her house cause her parents were away and we had sex for the first time. 

When we were sleeping she took a picture of my penis. I was actually just sleeping naked as was she. I only now realize it cause I saw the flash go off and heard the phone camera sound.

I didn't think much of it and I was also more than half asleep.

Fast forwards to a few mins ago my best friend texts me that there are dick pics going around of me and then compliments me like I'm ""the man"" or something meanwhile I'm freaking out. It's like he texted me not to warn me but to congratulate me!

Anyway I put two and two together and realize that she took the picture and sent it around.

So I called her out on it and at first she denied it but then I caught her in a lie and she admitted to taking the pictures and sending them to a group chat of 5 of her girlfriends (and their one gay male friend).

I feel so violated and pissed and whenever I try to explain to someone that I'm mad and I feel this is wrong, they try to talk me into thinking that this is a good thing because ""it means I got laid and it means my dick is getting ""exposure"" so that's a good thing""?!?!

The girl fees no remorse and when I said I wanted her to delete them she said ""fuck no lmao don't be a pussy"". And then she invited me to come over and ""fuck her again lmao"" but I don't wanna go now.

I forgot to mention I was always self conscience about my penis cause it's on the small side (like no more than 5"" on a good day). So in my head I'm thinking that everyone is probably making fun of how small it is.

I know that sending nudes without permission is not cool and starting to become a real concern when it happens to people but the reactions I'm getting ppl are saying I gotta be proud and stop complaining.

Please can anyone help with advice.",relationship_advice
I (33f) found out that my husband (34m) has a mistress (20f) and I honestly don't mind which has me questioning my sanity.,"He doesn't know that I know and I'm not sure whether I should confront him or just look the other way. I'm not angry or hurt or upset. Maybe a tad jealous but otherwise I'm honestly not bothered by it. 

It is understandable given our dead bedroom situation. We have only had sex a handful of times in the past year. He has always had a high sex drive and I'm just not in the mood for it most of the time.  The  birth of our second child caused significant tearing resulting in painful sex. I've also gained around 50 lbs from hypothyroidism and the pregnancies. My husband's a very good looking guy and works out at the gym most days a week. 

I'm probably more relieved than anything else. At least he is getting his sexual needs met. We've been married for ten years and have two kids under 5 and overall we have a good marriage other than the sex so I'm 99.99% confident that he isn't going to run off with her. Even if he is spending a little money on her, it's really not my business as long as he provides for us, which he does very well

I'm surprised by my reaction as well. Am I normal?",relationship_advice
"Leaving my Husband. Made a bullet list of conversation topics to keep my head straight. Any advice, opinions welcomed.","I (24F) have been married to my husband (30M) for 2 years, together for 5. We have 2 boys under 3.

Things that I will always love about you.

-Your deep voice.

-Your up beat spirit, always laughing, always joking.

-Your dimple smile.

-Your integrity, your honestness

-The way you provide tirelessly for your family

-Your handsomeness  

-Your big heart.

-The way you play with the boys and make them smile.

Things that are not working. (We have talked about everyone of these, to no avail.)

-Your selfishness with your down time. 
(Always doing what YOU need, video games, on your phone, running your personal errands, not recognizing that I need personal down time too) 

-The way you isolate (we have no friends, no social life, you don't even want to visit with my family)

-The way you expect me to isolate with you. (If I'm not with the kids, and doing something while you are working or having YOUR down time, you expect me to be there with you when YOU are ready.)

-Manipulating me to not leaving you alone with the kids (when I was at the gym or my AA meeting or an appointment, you would demand me back right away, guilt tripping me. when I would leave and rush home Caleb would be calm anyway.)

-Our intimacy issues. (We have never been on the same page, sadly I have begun to loose interest in you sexually) 

-The way you have exhausted the extravagant gift giving, (buying gifts doesn't replace the glue that is slipping away) 

-They way you act like you are better than everyone else because your now on a sober path, (you look down on people who drink or smoke pot, 75% of the population does, it doesn't make them a bad person, or an addict)

-The way that I'm 100% ignored; physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually, (you are always so lost in your phone or game you never hear me, you are not interested in me until I get upset.)

-The way you hold financial burden over my head. (Belittle me because you are the breadwinner, ""good luck having a life with no income"")

-The way you take ""jokes"" too far. (You know you are making me upset and you turn passive aggressiveness into a game and claim you are just joking, having fun.)

-The way we both are stubborn, butting heads, never backing down, trying to hurt each other with words. (We are unhealthy, the kids hear us fighting and it's untrue that they would be better off if we stick together. they need two happy, healthy parents, even if we're not under the same roof.)

Where do we go from here.

I want a separation. I want to share custody. I want to be healthy co-parents, we don't have to go through courts right away. I don't want half of your everything. I want to be amicable. I don't hate you in the least bit. I just cannot be happy married to you.",relationship_advice
Update: My wife may be cheating,"TL:DR Wife wants to divorce if I get the position. She has an answer to everything I saw. I just don't believe her.

I just want to update what has transpired since the post yesterday. Shortly after I posted Saturday, I finally was able to get her to come out of our bedroom. She had me assure her that I would not yell. I said I just want to talk. So I went over everything I saw. The unmade bed, the dinner the wine, Sam leaving right away. She asked what was wrong with any of it? She did not make the bed that day, she was trying out a new recipe, had wine with dinner and finished it after. Probably drank too much. Sam is a long time bachelor, wife passed away 7 years ago. He stays busy with some of the charities we work with. I just shook my head, I know what I was seeing but she has an explaination for all. I asked why she would not open the door. She started with she was afraid of me. She knows that I have never laid a hand on anyone since the 8th grade. It is not me, I would rather talk things out or seperate until everyone cools down. The other reason was she was not ready to tell me something else.

We have known of the position opening since April. My boss presented to the board his plan to retire end of the year. They want the position filled by 4th qtr. There would be a time when the incoming VP would work along side my boss. My boss has vacation time accumulated so that he won't be working much in December. He gave us the heads up shortly after notifying the board. The wife and I talked about it since then. She has expressed that she did not want to start life over again. She has a nice career, her company does not have a branch back east. She would have to job hunt. I told her she could just not work but feels that she would be unfulfilled. She really thinks I will get the promotion because of my boss. I told her over and over that it is not final until the board votes on a candidate.

So she has decided that she would rather divorce than move. She just wasn't ready for me to come home early. She had not in her mind how to tell me. She knew it would crush me. We have a very solid marriage up to now. We do not put on a show for others since we are in the public so much. Sex is still good. Has diminished in frequency as we have aged. We both initiate. We are very much each others best friend. She was right. I am crushed. I asked what was her plan if I don't get the job. Her answer was that everything stays the same then. I asked her if she was crazy. Did she think I would forget? Forgive?

I called my lawyer. We are friends also. Me calling on the weekend is not an infringment into his personal time. After pleasantries he listen to me until I mentioned potential divorce. He stopped me there. He said ""I can not represent you"". The wife has already hired him. I asked if he new someone else, he said he will send me a list of names from other firms. He told me he personally will not handle the divorce, he will hand it over to another associate in the firm.

I still have an uneasy feeling on what I saw. So I took a couple of commentors suggestion. I called Sam. I explained to him very calmly that the wife and I talked. Now I want to hear from him. He gave me the same story word for word, like it was rehearsed. Then I got hold of the wifes phone. It was scrubbed clean. Only messages from Saturday night and today. I guess I am getting divorced anyways why should it matter but it does. 

A few years ago I was off work for a couple months due to some medical issues. I had the company install an office in my home. I took one of the kids old rooms and made a home office. I had couple of the IT guys come over and get me set up. At the time it was better than my office at work. So I called one if the guys to ask if you can retrieve erased messages and call logs that were deleted from a Samsung S10? He said that it was easy, ""Goggle it"". I asked him if he could walk me through it. So after a bit we had most of records restored. I searched the phone and found lots of calls to one number, I don't know who, a few months ago. I found Sams number lots of calls recently. I checked the texts nothing overly sexual but certainly not charity related, lots of meet up plans. As I am finishing the wife knocks on the door as I locked myself in. She asked if I seen her phone. I opened the door and said "" yeah I have it I fixed it."" She asked what I meant. I told her that I saw her call logs and messages were deleted, so I restored them. Her mouth dropped open, she stuttered. Then came the obligory ""You went thru my phone?"" She snatched the phone and stormed away. I called after her ""we need to talk some more"". She went out the door and have not seen or heard from her all day.

So Monday I need to call the lawyer. I have already been thru bank records . No money has been moved around. I printed balances as of today. I now need to call my kids. I see that she had called each Saturday. I think the well has been poisoned. It is starting to set in. She is my life, my partner.  Now she will be gone. I feel like when my parents died. How can I go to such a position without her by my side?

Edit: Through this is all she is maintaining there is no cheating. She keeps saying that it may look like it but she would never do that to me.",relationship_advice
I [25M] got ghosted by my girlfriend [23F] of 2 years.,"I dated her for 2 years. She said she loved me almost everyday. I loved her too. We had plans to move in together and eventually get married someday. We were as serious as anything. Of course we had our ups and downs, but we were committed. Or at least, I thought I was.

Last week, I went on a business trip for 3 days. It was in London, so I was jetlagged and wasn't very responsive to her texts and calls. I warned her of this beforehand, I told her I'd be busy and tired. She said she understood. Her last text to me was just a few days into my trip, it said ""Heyy, hows London treating you?""

I took 2 days to respond, mostly because of connectivity issues/jetlag/busyness. I said, ""sorry I didn't respond sooner, it's been a hell of a weekend (EDIT: I am referring to my weekend preparing for the trip, not the trip overall which was during the week). but pretty good overall.""

She never responded to that text, or any of the others I sent. I came home and even drove to her apartment, but she wasn't there. I called her, messaged her on Facebook, Instagram, but she never responded, even though she was online. It is so completely bizarre and out of the blue. We weren't even in a rough patch or anything. We were just always really stable and in love.

It's been a whole week since her last text. I have no clue what's going on. She is very sensible, not the type to just ghost someone. What could be happening? I've been racking my head trying to think of things that might have led to this, but I can't think of ANYTHING. Sure, I didn't reply to her for 2 days but that's not a valid reason to just ghost me entirely, right? I even warned her about it.

Does anyone know what may be going on?

TL;DR: My girlfriend of 2 years just ghosted me out of the blue. No explanation, nothing.

EDIT: So apparently ppl want to know the timeline...sorry, I use ""week"" and ""days"" liberally. I get the confusion.

Sunday, May 20 (evening): fly into London

Monday, May 21: Day 1 of business trip (she texts me)

Tuesday, May 22: Day 2 of business trip

Wednesday, May 23: Day 3, I respond. Fly out in evening. No response at all since.",relationship_advice
I (20f) Checked My BF's (29m) Phone And May Have Ruined Our Relationship,"He was on his computer playing a game and his notifications were going off like crazy.  It was like 3am. There's this one girl from his work that texts him sometimes and she's really pretty, I saw it was from her and got a bad feeling so I checked his phone. It was stupid but he works late with her sometimes and said she told him she was interested in him once, when I see her I always wonder why he's still with me. 
  
So I started reading and it was all pretty innocent but he seemed really close to her and I got kinda sad and got sucked into it guess. When I looked up again he was turned around looking at me in his chair.  
  
I'd asked him early on if we could exchange phone passwords and he said no because he valued his privacy, so I definitely broke his trust and I know that was stupid and wrong. 
  
He asked if I found what I was looking for. I couldn't really say anything, I just kinda sat there looking at him and waiting for him to yell at me. (He's never yelled at me, but my family does and it just felt like he should.) He asked me if there was anything else I wanted to look at while I had his phone and I shook my head no. Then he came over and kissed me on the forehead, and said he'd take me home.  
  
I cried the entire way back and he didn't say a word. He walked me to my door and patted my head and left. I've texted him a few times today but he hasn't answered. 
  
I couldn't go to work today, I've just been in ther corner if my room curled up watching YouTube videos and crying. He won't talk to me at all, I don't know how mad he is or what he's thinking and feel sick. We were talking about getting married. How do I get him to communicate with me again so I can apologize?

[NSFW] Caught my boyfriend of over 10 years masterbating to my female guest in the middle of the night.,"Ok, so this is an issue I thought I would never have happen to me. It was in the middle of the night and my boyfriend got out of bed without realizing I was still awake. He went to use the restroom and ended up taking a longer time than expected. I got up to see what the issue was, and there he was, jerking off while looking at my sleeping female guest in the living room. I watched for about 5 seconds and then made a noise to alert him I was watching him. He saw me, tucked his member back in his pants, and walked back to the bedroom.

Im completely in shock. I had no idea the man I've spent so many years with, was such a pervert. I feel violated and disgusted.

I don't know how to even approach the next steps. We have an apartment together and have really built a life together. I cannot imagine myself forgiving him. What do I do? This happened tonight and I'll be going to work off no sleep. Someone please help. 

UPDATE: there's a twist to this story I haven't said yet, and it's who the female guest is. She's my 59 year old mother. 

NEXT UPDATE: 
I sent a text saying- 

I know what you did, don't think I'm dumb. We are having a very serious conversation tonight. 

His response copied and pasted - 

Ok I know your not stupid and I'm not going to play dumb l made a really bad decision by doing that there's no excuses and in no way will I be trying to defend what I did I'm going to take my repercussions whatever they may be I know you're not going to believe me but I'm sorry I guess we'll talk more about it later. 

My Response - 

I don't even know if I want to talk. Just leave me the fuck alone. Don't talk to me or text me. 

MY NEXT UPDATE: 
I kicked him out for a couple days. He's on his way to pick up a few things. I thought I was able to really speak about what happened last night, but I can't. I have so many thoughts and words I could yell but I feel no energy or want to go there. So I lay here alone crying my eyes out. Wishing for a hug or someone to help me stay strong through this process. He already has sent me money to pay for the bills that are due. He's being mature and respectful. I'm being petty and angry and I have every right to be. The caring part of me is still asking where he's going. I shouldn't care but he's been my best friend and only friend for a long time. He says he'll be staying in his car. I tell myself I don't care. Does it make me a stupid person if I still do care? Anyways. I'm trying to stay strong and recover while alone. Thank you so much for everyone's kind words. 

MY FINAL UPDATE: I couldn't bear leaving him out somewhere on the street. I've asked him to come back. We talked it through for over an hour now and yes he does fantasize about being caught. No he is not attracted to my mother. He regrets his decision fully. We laid out all of our dirty laundry. I do not forgive him for this and am not accepting this apology right away. I don't know whether or not I should forgive him. Yes my rage level was through the roof today. I was irrational in some of my responses earlier to him. I've made it clear a therapist is completely needed for us to move forward. He is sleeping on the couch for a while and I am not looking for his comfort anytime soon. Thanks to all who have given me constructive criticism and really helped me get through this hard conversation and reality I had to face. This man is my best friend. He did make a mistake and he is willing to work through whatever it takes to move forward. Yes I can understand we can all be a little messed up at times and make stupid decisions. He's keeping his distance from me as requested. But I don't want to deprive him of our home as well. This may take months to truly come to terms with the situation at hand. And I may take months to fully figure out what direction in life I want to take. All I can do is try to stay as positive as possible and know I'll get through this with myself day by day. With or without him is still the question.

I managed to get ahold of his family, as he hasn't been answering my calls or my children's calls as usual, and I was trying to get them in touch with him. And surprise... he's not back in his country. Apparently he called them from Rome the day before. He has been there for two weeks now, since he left. His family was also surprised to learn about the lie.

So, it's 100% clear that he has left for someone else, as he has no other reason to be in Rome, and lie about going back home. Of course it hurts like nothing else. But this is helping me with the self-blame and the guilt at least. I do recognize that I had become emotionally detached, due to lack of trust from past episodes, which I blamed myself for to no end after he left. But apparently I had some big ass basis for having those reservations.

I'll get a lawyer and fight for custody, and I'll try to heal from the immense pain this man has caused me and my children.

Update: My (22M) girlfriend (20F) has been hoarding my used condoms,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc20or/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_has_been_hoarding_my_used/)

Well, I feel a lot better. Definitely wasn't as big a deal as I thought it would be.

I went to V's place after class and we watched some GoT, and told her I had something serious to ask her. She looked scared like she thought I was going to ask to take a break, which made me feel bad but it made my actual question easier to ask. I cut straight to the chase and asked ""Why is there a tupperware container filled with used condoms in your bathroom?"". She took a few seconds to process and then kinda laughed, and said ""I promise its nothing bad but it might be better if you don't know for another month or so"", which made me feel way better but I told her that I needed to at least have a vague idea of their purpose. It actually is pretty funny.

So, V is on a sports team that is kinda rowdy. And the team has a fierce rivalry with another team at a college in the same town. The other team stole something from them recently so V's team has been thinking of a way to get them back. The girls settled on the idea to hoard condoms and dump them on or in something that belongs to the other team (they aren't sure whether it will be easier to do their house, their car, their backpacks, or something else like coat pockets). So all the girls have been hoarding for like three weeks now, and they plan on striking soon. She didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me to be an accomplice. I love a good prank war though so I approve. I'm slightly worried that my DNA is going to be mysteriously found at a crime scene this summer, but I honestly can't imagine things going that far.

The lesson learned is, always ask your partner before jumping to conclusions. Although me posting this on Reddit might save my ass if I do get framed for rape, so I don't feel too bad about my decision. Also, to the person who posted that she is keeping them because she has a fetish for swallowing huge loads at a time, God bless you.  


Edit: I'll bring up the fake cum idea with her later. I'm really not worried about the other girls going to the cops; their is something of an honor code within the sport.",relationship_advice
My friends didn't invite me to their wedding then made me the bad guy,"**EDIT:** Update at the bottom!  (Another update will come tonight after Tracey calls me when she gets out of work)

**EDIT TWO:** FINAL UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM.

Sorry for the long story, I added a tl;dr. I'm definitely looking for advice but it comes with a backstory:

A friend (Greg-28) in my circle of friends met (Shannon-28) about 5 years ago and they immediately hit it off. Everybody instantly fell in love with Shannon because she's friendly and really fun to hang out with. They were everybody's favorite couple and really made our hang-outs much more fun. We all knew they were perfect for each other. They both made our crew that much better.

The engagement was expected but much welcome news. Our friends circle was buzzing about the inevitable wedding. Then the invitations went out.

You know those ""save the date"" magnets that people send out? Well it really sucked seeing them on everybody else's fridge when I visited friends knowing I didn't get one and wasn't invited. Feeling left out really sucks. But it gets worse.

I completely understand how stressful wedding planning is and I believe nobody should feel that they have to invite people they don't want to their wedding. It's their day and their ceremony and they shouldn't have to have people there who they don't want there. I didn't cause a fuss or express to anyone that I was hurt that I felt excluded from the wedding and by extension, excluded from the group. I didn't want to be looked on in an even worse way that I feel I was apparently being looked at. But one friend actually stood up for me.

When their wedding came up in conversation and people talked about booking flights and rooms (destination wedding in New York City) eventually I was asked if I booked yet. I said, ""We (me and my girlfriend) weren't invited."" Nobody could believe it but I insisted that I wasn't upset because I know how situations like this can go. I didn't want to cause trouble because then the happy couple might resent me. Then I'd be the bad guy.

I heard through other friends that my friend Tracey thought it was really messed up that I wasn't invited. She and I never spoke of how I wasn't invited to the wedding but she really felt a certain way about it. So a month before the destination wedding I got a text from Greg basically saying sorry for forgetting to send an invite but that they would love to have us come to the wedding. It was way too late at that point for me. 

I couldn't get away from my job and I didn't have a chance to put money aside for a year for an expensive NYC destination wedding like everyone else did. I didn't even get a Save the Date. Every flight and hotel (no rooms where everyone ELSE was staying, obviously. Too late for that) was unaffordable for me. I texted him back that I couldn't make it.

The wedding came and went and I felt bad about everything. I saw the Facebook pictures of my friends all having the time of their lives. It looked like a great wedding. There's even a picture of just the group of friends labeled ""the crew"". I don't think I've ever felt so left out, honestly. It really made me feel worthless and unwanted.

So naturally the typical thoughts surfaced. ""They don't like you. They think you're annoying. They think you're an asshole. If you can't identify the schmuck in a group of friends, that means you're it. They think you try way to hard to be nice and think you're a phony.""

Then as if it couldn't get any worse, Shannon messaged me on Facebook asking why I didn't RSVP and said they missed me at the wedding? RSVP? **RSVP?** Doesn't one have to be *invited* in order to RSVP? Everybody got a year to prepare between getting Save the Dates and *actual* wedding invitations. I got a text message a month before the wedding! Just as I feared, I'm being made out to be the bad guy and I even made a point to keep my feelings to myself and play it cool. 

But as usual I didn't say this to her because I know how I would end up looking. I actually apologised for... I don't even know... but I made a point to mention how I spoke with Greg about it. I also made sure to compliment the wedding pictures and say it looked like fun. I did everything I could in that conversation to make it easier on her and of course now I feel like a total schmuck.

That was this past Summer and I haven't seen them since. I feel like that's it for me in the group now. I see some of the friends in our group every now and then but everything feels different now. None of them even responded to my birthday party Facebook invite this month. I feel like things are being said behind the scenes and I feel completely out of the loop. It felt like a passive aggressive message that maybe Greg and Shannon never actually liked me. My fiance gets along great with Shannon and she's just confused. Seeing her confusion just makes my heart break even more because she's a sweetheart who's never offended anybody in her life. I wish I could break it to her that I'm just the guy in the group that Greg and Shannon think sucks but I don't know how and I feel like a complete loser who deserves this.

I'll always appreciate Tracey for sticking up for me. She may never know how awesome it feels hearing about how she told everybody it was messed up that I was left out. I haven't even spoken to her about how the whole thing made me feel (or ANYBODY for that matter, Reddit you are the first to hear about it) because I didn't want it to appear like I am making a stink and become even more disliked. 

This whole thing just fucking sucks. I feel like I don't have friends anymore. And to make it worse, soon I'll have a wedding of my own and I'm afraid I won't have any friends there (except for Tracey, of course). How am I supposed to handle who I invite so it doesn't seem like I'm leaving people out for petty revenge? How the hell do I navigate a toxic situation that I had no hand in creating? I still feel like I'm in the dark or could be over-reacting. What the hell????

tl;dr: Friends forgot or chose not to invite me to their wedding. After a friend stuck up for me I was invited via text message (with little notice), had to decline, then asked why I didn't RSVP and that I was ""missed"". Soon I'll have my own wedding to plan and don't feel like I have any friends to invite/don't know if I should invite certain people/don't know how to even approach the situation I didn't create.


**UPDATE**. I half took everyone's advice and brought it up with Tracey. She just confirmed that Shannon was full of shit when she asked me why she didn't get my RSVP and wanted to absolve herself of guilt. I'm not sure if they forgot or if I just wasn't invited yet but Tracey said we'd talk about it more tonight when she gets out of work. 

**Final update:**

 I spoke about it in depth with Tracey. It turns out Greg's best man(someone who was never in ""the gang"" but grew up with Greg) always hated me and Greg thinks I'm annoying. Shannon later felt bad they chose not to invite me and pressured him to invite me over text knowing I wouldn't be able to make it. Also it wasn't only Tracey who thought it was wrong that I didn't get an invite and the ""chatter"" is what made Shannon ask me why I didn't RSVP (to make it seem like my invite was lost in the mail).

It feels better knowing this because, like I said, they don't have to have people they don't want at their wedding. But knowing Greg doesn't like me fucking hurts because I always thought we were friends. Turns out *he's* the phony. Unfortunately everybody else (except for Tracey and a few others) like Greg more than me so they kinda felt like they had to choose a side after Tracey (and a few ot hers, it turns out) brought up why I didn't get invited. Lots of people feeling guilty about this, apparently. They still felt like they had to ""choose a side"" for whatever reason. Probably because most of them went to high school with Greg. 

Oh well. That's life. Thanks for the advice about being more assertive. Those of you polite about it were very helpful. Thanks.

My(27F) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31M). Everyone thinks I should break up with him but I don't want to. What do I do?,"My husband (my son's dad) passed away when he was 2. I thought I could never date or be with anyone ever again until I met my current boyfriend a year ago. He is a wonderful person and we got serious pretty quickly.  I introduced him to my son about three months into dating him and they got along fine. He is really good with my son and he genuinely enjoys spending time with him. My son was also happy to spend time with him and he got along with him fine until about a month and a half ago. I don't know what happened, he went to visit his grandparents for a week and when he came back he became quite withdrawn and didn't want to spend time with my boyfriend anymore. He told me that he doesn't want me seeing him anymore. I thought maybe he was just reminded of his dad after spending time with his grandparents. Even though he was 2 when he passed away I've always tried to make sure he knows about his dad. I thought he would be OK after a few days. But he still hasn't warmed back up to my boyfriend. 

I think he still does like him but is apprehensive about spending time with him for some reason. The other day he was really excited and asked me whether ""(my boyfriend) will be coming"" with us to watch a movie but then seem to check himself and refuse when I offered to call and ask.  I have tried to find out from his why he's being like this and he just says he doesn't know or I just don't want to (see him).  I Am at a loss for what to do. 

This has been very hard on me and my boyfriend. He has grown quite fond of my son and this rejection is making us both feel really shit. My mother and older sister are pressuring me to do what's best for my son and break up with him. My older brother thinks that this will pass and also that my husbands parents may have said something. I can't imagine them doing something like that. I also think maybe he just needs more time and to just spend more time with my boyfriend (although I also don't want to force him) . 

Am I being selfish? I love my son very very much. But I also don't want to break up with my boyfriend and I also think that he's good for my son. Am I being a horrible mum?

Tldr: my son suddenly stopped getting along with my boyfriend. Do I give it more time or should I break up?  Am I being selfish?",relationship_advice
"Gave a kidney to my cousin, he thanks god","Six years ago today I donated one of my kidneys to my cousin. It saved his life. I did it because he needed it and I'm fine with one. But when he talks about it, mostly on anniversaries like today, he says ""God is good,"" and ""thanks to God."" Fine. He can do that. But I don't believe in God, and I feel that saying that undermines the fact that I independently chose to give him part of my body. I don't think he means it maliciously. The whole family talks about it this way, actually, and it is really getting to me. I am not close to my cousin but I feel that giving away body parts is a big deal. Do I just let it go? Partly I think I wanted to do this to show that atheists can be kind, that you don't need God to do good things, to be good.

So, I don't know if I should approach the situation in anyway, or let it go and deal with it in my own.

Edit: I think what bothers me is less so the lack of recognition for me and more the absurdity of attributing it to a god. Maybe more suited for r/atheism

Edit 2: thanks for all the thoughts, I've reflected a lot. Moving on now, nothing to be done, what I wanted to happen happened (he stayed alive). Also wow to the number of people who didn't seem to read any of my post but had a lot to say.",relationship_advice
My husband married my co-wife because we were told I was infertile. I love his second wife. Now I'm pregnant. What do I do?,"I'm from a culture where it's okay for husband to have up to four wives although it is not often done. When my husband and I got married he said he only ever wanted me. We got along great and we fell in love soon after the wedding. (Arranged marriage). 

After trying for a child for a long time we found out I had diminished ovarian reserve and we would not get pregnant and IVF would most likely be futile round after futile round. 

I was absolutely heartbroken I could not bare his children for him. He was more okay with this than I was. We discussed and reached the decision together for him to have a second wife as long as she would be a good fit for his life. For example, would she be okay living together with first wife (me)? Our religion says a second wife has rights to her own place. 

We didn't rush into anything and I actually found a girl who was interested and I introduced her to my husband. They got on well and I didn't have very much jealousy and things are great. 

They got married and we all live together. While there were ups and downs (just like my husband and I when we first got married) eventually things were great. We all lived together and our husband treats us both excellently. She soon became pregnant and we were all excited. Her pregnancy was hard but I looked after her. When baby came I was also a mother and love this child like my own. We all get on so well. 

She now has a 4 and 2 year old to my husband. When we discussed our feelings once. She said she feels secure because she has been able to give our husband children. And I feel secure because I was his first wife. 

However. I just found out I'm 8 weeks pregnant. I never expected this to happen. And really I am so happy. But I'm terrified how this is going to change our relationship dynamic. I am scared she will be hurt or our house hold might be split into two households and then I only get my husband 50% of the time with a newborn.

I briefly even thought of suicide or abortion but I'd never ever do this. Ive just really been in dark place and being really emotional. I really don't want to hurt my co wife though. I don't want to ruin our family dynamic. I also feel pressure of time. I haven't told my husband or my cowife.

Please I really need advice.

"Gf (36) wants me (38) to pay for her college debt of $80,000. Says if I don't, our relationship is over. Should I just leave? I currently pay all the rent, utilities, food, cell phones, travel and entertainment. It didn't start this way.","When I moved in with my gf, she had just graduated with a masters in accounting and was working as a public accountant.  I moved in after being with her for 2 weeks. At the time, I was coming out of a divorce and I was afraid of being alone.  That's why I rushed in...

Before I moved in she told me about her $80,000 in debt.  She was making $60,000 a year. I stepped up and said I would pay the rent and utilities so that she would have the extra money to pay her debt down.

Its 30 months later now. She quit her job 10 months ago because she didn't like the work load or the people she worked for. She wanted to get a CPA to make more money, she said, and she wanted to quit so that she could have time study for the exam. I supported her decision. 

Then she did not study very hard, took one part, failed and decided to get a new job. She interviewed a few times. Then she decided to stop looking for work. Just told me one day...  she doesn't want to work. 

Now I'm told, as a man - I need to take care of all the money things.  Her college debts are my problem now. She refuses to work, she might try to make some money sewing. She says I need to support her.  She tells me it's only $1,000 a month more and that I don't know how to spend my money and that she should manage my cash flow.  

She says her loan problem is a man's problem. I just need to make more money. 

I'm feeling used - boundaries violated...  

I think I should leave?

I still need some advice and insight. 

I read every response and read all the DMs I was sent, but I wasn't able to respond to everyone. I got some great advice from that thread, and I followed through with some of it. I have a couple of updates I wanted to share. 

Original Post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/al10mq/my_36f_boyfriend_41m_of_45_years_ran_into_his/


It seemed like there was a mixed response on whether or not I should try to message her or not. I thought I try to get in touch with her anyway, thinking she'd either ignore it, block me or respond. She and I talked for several hours on facebook, and gave me the rundown of the worst years of their relationship. (I was at my mom's house when this happened). I asked her about their relationship, if it was really as bad as she made it seem, how did it end and a few other questions. She told me that their relationship was great the first 3 or so years they were together, that he was the best boyfriend she had ever had at that point. He was used overly flattering ways to compliment her, showered her with gifts, brought her to nice restaurants, drove her around wherever she wanted b/c she didn't have a car at the time. But, once they moved in together things started to go downhill. She was living in an apartment by herself for awhile, and he asked to move in because he was being evicted from his apartment. She agreed at the time. He tried to explain that he had paid his landlord in cash, but the landlord denied ever getting money from him. She gave him the benefit of the doubt with that excuse, but remembered it being a big red flag she ignored. 


As time went by for the last 2 years they were together, things got progressively worse. He began drinking more, he denied using drugs but she was confident he was doing cocaine as he displayed almost all the signs of a coke user. (Staying out all night with his friends, not coming home until 7-8am in the morning, seemed erratic and would talk really quickly and what he said didn't make any sense). The more he drank and used drugs the more aggressive he became. At first he would pick arguments with her, he'd get angry, maybe even call her some hurtful names or say mean things about her. He would sober up and do everything he could to apologize and seek forgiveness. He started to use his alcoholism as a crutch and would use the excuse ""it doesn't count when I'm drunk"" with her. She said she was young and stupid enough to believe that excuse, and stayed with him and wanted to help him sober up. He even agreed that he had a problem and would let her help him. But, he would keep getting drunk every night and would make her feel ugly, stupid, worthless whenever he drank too much.  


She said she remember feeling like the life was draining out of her as she tried to help him. She knew she was in a bad place and didn't have it in her to ask for help, stand up to him or leave. She was ashamed of the situation she got herself in to and just stayed. 


Kate said it got to the point where he would get absolutely wasted every single day. He would start drinking in the morning and continued through the night. She said she remembered finding a cache of empty bottles behind a free standing cabinet in her apartment. She said that finding that stash was bizarre, she didn't understand why he didn't just throw them away. But was also surprised that the way this piece of furniture was placed that you couldn't easily see the bottles, and the shape of the furniture created a space to perfectly hide those bottles. She didn't touch it once she found it, but monitored it and saw that it grew in height quickly. And the quality of the alcohol went down, like the bottom of the stash had top shelf liquor, and the upper bottles became shit like everclear. She never saw him buy these bottles or have them out in the open. He would lie about being drunk even though he was clearly out of it. She remember she kept a few airplane bottles of liquors for herself to make a cocktail, but a lot of them were things that needed mixers- like kahlua, godiva chocolate, baileys other milky-chocolatey drinks or fruity alcohol no one would choose to just drink by itself. But, she remember opening up her little stash of those tiny bottles and every single one was empty.  


Their fights progressed when he was getting even more wasted. He would become extremely violent. She said he would take any nearby object - plate, cup, beer bottle, wine bottle, one of her things, etc and just slam it as hard as he could against the floor, wall or brick fireplace. Sometimes he would throw these objects at her and she would have to find something to shield herself with. She remembers shielding from shards of glass flying at her a lot. These outbursts were extremely frequent, she said she tried to clean up the glass on the carpet with her vacuum but it never seemed like enough. So she started to always wear shoes in the apartment after stepping on a shard of a glass a few times. In addition to throwing things, he punched a hole in one of the kitchen cabinets, almost ripped a door off of one of its hinges and purposefully broke things that were part of the apartment. He would also back her up against a wall or a corner punching himself in the face or chest while screaming at her. She doesn't remember what he was saying she just remembers crying and telling him to stop whenever this happened. 


She said she remembered getting to a point towards the end of their relationship where she didn't want to have sex with him anymore. She said she was successful most of the time when trying to refuse him. But, sometimes if she refused he would get angry and either scream or throw something. She'd have sex with him after that because she didn't want the violence to escalate. She also said she tried to pretend she was asleep, pretend that she was sick, pretend she had to get up early and other excuses - and he would just go for it anyway. She said that she tried simply saying ""no"" and he ignored her on multiple occasions or would get angry until she gave in. She remembered being too scared to say to no to him and just lied there with her eye closed and he got angry because she wasn't in to it. She also said she doesn't have a number of how many times that happened, but it happened a lot. 


She also told me about the night she realized he was likely kind of crazy in a very bad. That she was scared of him, but didn't think he was crazy but just a violent asshole, but the following event made her feel like she was in a different kind of danger.  At one point she got brave enough to tell him that she didn't love him anymore, that she wanted him out of her apartment asap and that she never wanted to see him again. He got angry and was screaming that if that is what she wants then she'll never have to see him again. He slept on the couch that night and told her while she was at work he would pack up his things and be gone from her life. When she came home from work that night, she walked into him playing a video game with a mutual friend. He had cleaned the apartment, bought her favorite beer and was acting super cheery like nothing had ever happened. After the mutual friend left she asked him what was going on they had the fight and he was suppose to leave, and he said something along the lines of ""what? that never happened.""


He would frequently make her feel crazy and question her reality. He would lie to her constantly and always about things she couldn't prove were true or not. That he often lied about how he needed to spend money on his car, or he needed to buy new clothes for his job, or that he owed someone money for something. He would make her think that she was always the one in the wrong whenever they argued. She said he always found a way to turn the argument around on her. He would do things like always leave the apartment unlocked and tell her she was the one who forgot to lock the doors. He would also hide things from her and claim he never moved them. 


She was only able to escape that situation by lying about the day that the lease ended. She had told him that the lease was ending in month, when in reality it was a couple of months. She told him she was moving out to a different city to go back to school and he needed to make arrangements. Since he never paid any money for anything, he had no idea that was a lie. Once he left she stopped answering any phone calls or emails from him. She was concerned that he ended up moving to the same city she moved to. They met in her college town, she moved back to her hometown. He also moved to her hometown (where we live now, but it's a much bigger city than the college town FWIW). 


I asked her about stalking concerns, and she said that the first year they were apart he would try to call her from different phone numbers for awhile. She's still afraid of answering the phone from numbers she doesn't recognize. She also said she's confident that he would drive down the same street her parents lived on (where she was living for awhile after she left him). She said she doesn't think he has tried to find her in recent years, but it remains a fear of hers. She said said that this was the first time he approached her, but she remembers she saw him at the mall once and ran away immediately and went home. She also saw his mom once in public, but left before his mom saw her. 


She said the things that she had told me up to this point in the convo were things that happened frequently, they weren't one-off events, they were things that happened several times a week. By the end of their relationship she was extremely depressed, she had suicidal thoughts, she thought she was worthless, she had to get therapy for depression, PTSD and anxiety. She told me that even though it's been 10 years she will still have a nightmare about him. She even told me that she remembered waking up to her own screams a few times after their relationship ended. 

She continued to tell me there were a handle of violent or crazy one-off events that stick out in her mind - 

* He once got so angry and violent, he pushed her down on the bed.

* He once pushed her so she fell backwards onto a couch. 

* He once put his hand around her throat and closed in just tight enough to scare but to not make any marks or cut off her breathing. 


* There were two times where she needed help paying the bills, she usually didn't ask him because he would complain about her only being concerned with money. But both of these instances were the same - she asked for money, he took out cash from his wallet and threw it in her face, and told her he was going to buy her something nice but isn't going to anymore. 


* When they were visiting two of her friends (who she knew didn't like him), he made it a point to deeply embarrass her - told her friends that she had slept all day, was lazy and he's okay with it and is okay taking care of her and cleaning up after her mess. 


* He visited her at work and asked for $10 cash. She told him that she needed that money to buy lunch, he said he would bring her lunch, he took the money and never came back. 


* He almost got her fired from her job - she had a job where they got products early and had a specific release date. Their manager would allow them to take home the product to learn about, but only if they prepaid for it. This was against store policy, but everyone kept their mouth shut. He went to a different location and blabbed to the employees there about what they did at her store, one of those employees happened to be a district manager visiting that store. She didn't get fired, but he ruined a fun perk for everyone. 


* When he would go through phases of unemployment she would try to get him to do some basic chores while she was gone. Things like load/unload dishwasher or take out the trash. She remembered that she asked him to take out the garbage, which he agreed to do. She put the garbage by the front door, it sat that for awhile. It sat there long enough to where a few more garbages bags piled up. He kept saying he would take out the garbage. She remember getting annoyed because it started to smell really bad and the bags were leaking. So she gathered them up and threw them away herself. When she got back inside he was angry and told her he was about to take out the garbage that minute. 


* She asked him to clean the kitchen once, when she got home from work he was in the kitchen cleaning but very sarcastically and in a mean tone said ""are you happy now?"" 


She also told me that after she went through therapy she realized that he very likely had NPD or at the very least a lot of narcassist tendencies. She remembered the following characteristics he displayed frequently: He thought very highly of himself, he thought that he was more intelligent, more attractive and simply ""better"" than others. He felt like he didn't need to have a real job ever, that he would just get the things he wanted one way or another. He ended up with free rent, free food, never having to cook or clean while he was with her. She said he trouble keeping jobs because he would always go in late, and even got caught stealing from one place. He would frequently talk about how people in his life were lesser than him, and how he was using and manipulating the people he worked for. He would also get angry if he was every in a position where he had to clean up after himself or perform a chore at home. He spoke and dressed in a manner that gave him the illusion that he was superior. He made it a point to speak by using ""big words"" instead of speaking plainly. He always wore higher end clothes - button up shirts, nice slacks, nice shoes, even though he didn't have the kind of job to support those buying habits.


After we spoke, I started to connect the dots of other things he does. And things he has done in the past that I never thought too much about. A lot of her comparisons of NPD was eerie, as he still displays a lot of those traits but not to the extreme as she described.  


She also told me to get a background check on him, she said the last she knew he was found guilty of the following: assault on a female, 2 DUIs, hit and run property damages, several drug (pot related) charges, and a theft charge. I never thought to ever do a background check on anyone I know, I guess I'm stupid to just trust people. But, I confirmed everything she has said, but it looks like he's been clean for the past 6 years.. whatever that means. Everything I found I was able to google his name + arrest records. The last thing he was arrested for was Fall of 2012, of what I could actually find online alone. 


I kept trying to get him to talk about what happened last weekend, but he kept refusing to talk about it. He eventually got really angry with me, more angry than I've ever seen him be before. His face got really red and it almost looked like was trying to hold himself back from reacting. I was honestly a little scared. I haven't told him I talked to her. She also informed me that she would be blocking me after our conversation ended because she didn't want any ties directly relating to him. 


I told my mom my boyfriend and I were having troubles and asked to stay with her for awhile. She said I'm welcome, as well as my son, to stay for as long as I want. 


So, I've packed a bunch of stuff for me and my son while he was at work and told him that we were going to stay at my mom's for a bit until he either wanted to talk or go see a therapist. However, I'm not sure I even want to continue the relationship anymore. I'm seeing him in a different light now and I don't like what I see. I guess it's time to find a lawyer and tell them about my situation. 


tl;dr: Reached out to Kate, his ex, on social media we talked for hours online while she described everything about their relationship which was horrifying. She told me to look into getting a background check for him - he has assault charges, DUIs, drug and other charges I could find. He got extremely angry and a little scary the last time I tried to get him to talk. My son and I are now at my mom's. Now I need to think about next steps.

[31] Overweight husband lost a lot of weight and now I'm [27F] insecure,"My husband and I have been married for 3 years and were dating for 2 and a half before that. In the beginning, we were both really in shape and met while training for a half marathon. About a year into our relationship (and a year before getting married) we had both gotten complacent and sedentary since our jobs were unexpectedly demanding and we gained a lot of weight. My husband went from a BMI of 20 to 26 and I went from a BMI of 19 to 27, so we both were overweight when we got married.

Over the course of our marriage, I've been gaining more weight and he's been steadily losing. I've been proud of him and trying to lose weight by joining him at the gym again and picking up running but he brought one of his gym friends home for dinner and I just felt so horrible.

After all his weight loss/working out, he's in the best shape I've ever seen him and his abs are starting to be more and more visible. His gym friend is in better shape than I have ever been; she's skinny and tall and has like 18% body fat and I just feel so horrible.  I know he would never cheat but I catch his eyes lingering sometimes and its really upsetting. I feel like I'm depriving him of the beautiful wife he deserves. I'm the heaviest I've ever been and he's the lightest he's ever been and our sex life has dwindled down to once a month and he really only does it for me.

It doesn't help that I catch his gym friend (the woman he brought to dinner) staring at him too and its like they have sizzling sexual tension and its just been breaking my heart. Advice please.",relationship_advice
"I (28M) wrongly accused my gf (24F) of cheating, don't know how to move forward.","Basically my (28M) girlfriend (24F) was acting shady. 
By shady I mean that she was on her phone a lot, making phone calls and I saw payments from her card for events and things I wasn't doing with her. 

I waited it out a week or two and the weirdness continued. She fell asleep and I went through her phone and found bookings for a hotel at the weekend in a city a while away and tickets for some sporting event on that weekend. 

I woke her up and shoved the phone at her, demanding she explain. She looked distraught and said ""do you really think I'd do that?"" And began to cry. She then told me to look at the bookings properly and when I did my heart sank. 

We rarely get time off together and she had booked me the weekend off through my boss as a suprise, booked a hotel in the city I said I wanted to visit and it just so happened my team were playing in that city that weekend so she'd spent a good amount on tickets. She'd also booked a table at my favourite restaurant. 

I instantly realised how stupid I'd been and I can't believe my first thought was that she would betray me when she's given me no reason to distrust her. It's kinda tainted the suprise weekend and she's so disheartened. I've tried to apologise but she's just shut off from me and is so hurt by my assumptions.

How can I make this better?

Wife Posted about considering divorce here's a update. Me(30M) Her(29F),"So a few months ago my soon to be ex-wife posted about 20% of our story in here and some very worthless advice was given to her. I just wanted people to see the outcome of her actions.

(Edit: I didn't mean for this to sound like I was passing off the blame to reddit. This post is just me venting. The only advice I'm asking for is at bottom of post. Try to stop focusing on the minute things and look at the bigger picture.)

I don't have any other options because my wife refuses to try marriage counseling and/or therapy.  My wife and I struggled a little for almost 3 years to get on our feet in partly due to the fact I can't get a decent job and moved around from job to job chasing the higher pays. And partially due to the fact that my wife was going through the greencard process for over a year and couldn't work so it was whatever crap check I could bring in every week and whatever money she could make online. And then when my wife got her greencard she refused to apply for standard beginner jobs to help us out because she felt we would just get caught in the trap of working crap jobs and never progressing. So she got a temp job that helped out for a few months while I was driving Uber and clearing around $500 a week after car expenses. We didn't save much money then because we were away from home 12-15 hours a day due to the 3-5 hour commute in NOVA/Washington DC area so we spent a lot on food. We ate out a lot and enjoyed ourselves every chance we got. We had moviepass which allowed us to go to the movies like 3 times a week for only $11 a month or something at the time. We went out to Dave and Busters and had game nights, and would go for walks in DC and explore the museums and such.

Her temp job ended and shortly after that Uber did a 1 year anniversary background check and apparently had changed their policies and said I couldn't drive for them anymore because of the trouble I got into about 10 years prior. (I vandalized some vending machines when I was 18 and got felony's, so screwed for life for that one teenage mistake.) So we had to turn in the car rental we had been using for over a year. I begged Natalia to just go right across the street and fill out an app at CVS or anywhere to help us financially and she still refused I probably should have pressed harder but me being me wanted her to be happy even if that meant we struggled and she's got to see that if she doesn't get a job we're going to struggle.

I started hitting the job postings and was getting pretty desperate (keep in mind that we had no car and I couldn't exactly go apply at cvs). I think I went a week or 2 without work before I got a lead on a really good job that ended up making me wait another 2 weeks to start but it was worth it. Got a company car, some meals and lodging paid for and all the hours I can work building greenhouses. And my wife got to come with me and even worked a little to help us save money because she wanted to go see her parenents she hadn't got to see in over a year because of the greencard process. So we worked for about 4 months and in those 4 months I had maybe 3 weekends off. It was 6am till 6-7pm 7 days a week for 3-6 weeks at a time. We got caught up on our bills, I got some dental work that was needed and we saved $6000 cash for our vacation. We went on our month long vacation to Argentina (Because unhappy struggling people can do this) and when it was time to come back I suggested that My wife stay and spend a little more time with her Parents since when she came back she would need to get a job so we could start saving to get a house and all the other stuff married couples are supposed to do. She was very happy about this and so I came back to the US expecting to work straight through the next 2 ish months till she came home. But when I got back I was told there was no work until Febuary (2-3 months away) So I went back to Florida where we moved from for the Initial Uber job.  After about a month My wife calls and tells me she may have a job lined up in Chicago and is wondering if I think she should take it. I told her my concerns…. 1) Its more expensive than anywhere we've discussed living, 2) it's a broke state, 3) its cold like 9 months out of the year etc. But I agreed because I could tell she really wanted the job…. It would be her dream career job. So she flies to Chicago from Argentina for the interview and then comes to florida to spend a couple weeks with me but I just end up working the whole time and barely got to see her. Well she got the job. She then leaves me and goes to stay with her parents who are visiting friends in Miami. I drive down to see her on a weekend and we spend the 2 days and a night together on the second day I leave. Little did I know this would be the last time I would see my wife. I was supposed to help her go up to Chicago and get situated in our new apartment but her parents jumped in and I got pushed to the backburner. The plan was for me to stay and save for a car and then come join her up there. Now we had discussed what job avenue I was going to pursue and we had agreed on a few different solutions we believed would be a good fit for me and we had all this planned out. So the day came and I called her to tell her we had the money for the down payment on a new car and that I could finally come join her. (at this point I had maybe spent 2 months out of the last 6 months with my wife so I was missing her pretty bad) When I told her that she told me she wasn't sure that was what she wanted or whatever she said at the time. Then proceeded to tell me that it was for this or that (nothing that justifies a divorce). She wants time to think about what she wants. So at this point in my head over the course of the next week while waiting for my wife to tell me she doesn't want to be with me. I'm trying to figure out what the hell I did. She continues to use lines like, Its me and not you. It wouldn't be fair for me to ask you to change. I cant help how I feel. Etc. Etc. Week later she confirms that she doesn't want to be married and she wants a divorce. So at this point I'm starting to feel a little used. Lets look at how it looks.

I busted my ass for almost 3 years to make sure every need and want that I could fulfill was fulfilled.

I about worked myself to death to save $6000 in 2 months to take her to Argentina to see her parents.

She lands her dream career job in a city across the country from me and when I tell her we're ready to buy a new car so I can go join her she tells me that she doesn't want me there and wants a divorce.

So at this point I find a post on Reddit that had been deleted by her simply by doing a google search. (Pro tip, If you put it on the internet it will always be there somewhere. You just have to find it.)

And in this post she proceeded to only give 20% of the story. She told them that while I was a good guy and treated her perfectly she just felt that because I was a felon I was going to hold her back in life and how she had just got this new career job and yadda, yadda. Just enough to get people on her side to help her justify in her head that what she's doing is right.

Well judging from how the article was written it feels to me that she thought she could stay and work her dream job after using me to climb there. And that's basically what some of the worthless people on reddit told her to do. Look after yourself etc, etc. What kind of person tells someone's wife to just leave without trying to fix the problem? Especially when you know you don't have the whole story.

So now that the whole story is out there…

No she will not keep her job, she has stipulations on the marriage based greencard to prove it wasn't a fraudulent wedding... well at this point its a pretty straightforward case. So not only will she not have her dream career job anymore but now she may have to spend any money shes able to save on a lawyer so hopefully she doesn't go to jail for greencard fraud. And then she'll have to go back to the 3rd worse economy in the world.

But I'm gonna hold her back in life?

By the way, Before we even met in person she was told everything about my past so there was nothing hidden.

So since I need to ask for advice, Where should I travel in the world first now that my monthly bills went from $2500+ to just $600 a month?

"My daughter was born with microtia, i.e she was born missing an ear. How do I convince my fiancé to stop playing video games and learn asl with me?","She does have normal hearing in the other ear. We were instructed to learn asl by doctors and her audiologist. She may not be a candidate for a cochlear implant or other hearing aides on the affected side. She is 7 months old now and I just can't help but feel we should be farther along than we are, which is currently a vocabulary of about 12 words. I know she is only retaining so much at this young age, but sign language is going to be a huge aide for her. He agreed when I expressed interest in learning but gets annoyed or frustrated when I ask to practice. He works two days a week (fireman). It makes it worse that my mother-in-law says she doesn't need it. I am the only one doing online classes and I can't help but feel discouraged. 

I just wish he could see this as not a chore but something that enriches all of our lives. Personally, I think it is cool and practical. 


Edit: 

Wow this blew up far more than I ever expected. Thank you so much for all the advice, positivity and stories so many of you had shared. To answer some questions, yes he is the biological father and he is otherwise an involved, good father.  We've been advised to learn ASL, or aim to be conversational in it, due to the fact that she solely depends on that one ear. If anything were to happen such as recurrent ear infections, TM rupture, anything, she would be at a disadvantage or it would at least delay her learning and development. 

I plan on following the advice of u/comecloser9 by stepping up my own study/practice methods and routine. I also plan on going to counseling together because as some of you have guessed, there are some underlying communication issues. 

Lastly I do no take issue with the hobby itself, that is fine! I will not be breaking his xbox lol. We all need and have outlets, I just don't like his lack of time management or lack of routine. When I try to work with him on establishing a schedule/routine on off days that incorporates ""gaming time"", like right after he gets home from work or in the evenings after dinner, he calls me the US government and talks about how he can't use his own property in his own house. *sigh*
We all have our flaws, we're all imperfect humans and we all can be thick headed about certain things so I'm cutting him some slack.

We'll see where we go from here! Thank you all again ",relationship_advice
Girlfriend [31F] wanted an open relationship. I [34M] reluctantly agreed. She freaked out now that I am sleeping with other women.,"About 4 months ago my girlfriend of 6 years brought up having an open relationship. At first I said no and was incredibly angry that she would even ask that of me. The thought of my girlfriend sleeping with other guys made me livid, so did the idea that she felt I wasn't giving her what she needs. 

After a few days she brought it up again and I reluctantly agreed to the arrangement. I decided to go ahead with it because I wanted her to be happy and not end up cheating behind my back. I do love her and realize that relationships consist of compromises and finding middle grounds.

I told her we could have an open relationship, but I don't want her telling me about other guys or where she is going when she does it. That she just needs to play it safe because I don't want any STDs. 

Anyhow, about a month into the new arrangement I realized she was meeting up with some guy for sex. I was pissed at first, but decided to start taking advantage of my new found freedom as well. There is no point in me sulking and being angry.

I started getting on dating apps and talking to new women and going out on dates. I, too, started sleeping with other women. I currently have 3 FWBs that I see fairly regularly. 

Anyhow, one of the FWBs likes sending me a bunch of nude selfies. She also likes taking videos of us having sex and sometimes sends me the videos. 

My girlfriend snooped my phone earlier and went ballistic. She asked me how many women am I seeing and why I am participating in sex videos. After yelling at me for a while she has been stuck in the bedroom sobbing and doesn't want to be around me. 

I am puzzled and really not sure what to do or even why she reacted the way she did considering she proposed this type of relationship. I am not sure how to proceed or even what to say to her. 

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their input. I am at work now and will try to read and reply to some of the responses. 

My girlfriend and I didn't talk at all last night, but she did say she wanted to talk this morning right before I was leaving for work. I told her we would talk tonight after work. 


Edit 2: 

Things didn't really go too well last night. We spoke about a number of things. She said that she was shocked to see that I was seeing so many women and that she thought I was taking the open relationship thing too far. We never discussed how many partners was acceptable and she thought it would just be one partner on the side. She also said some of the texts she saw hurt her because she thought they crossed a line. 

She said she the open relationship is a mistake and she wants to go back to a monogamous relationship. 

I told her it is too late for that. She already has involved people outside of our relationship into this mess, and that I am not going to hurt others by breaking off my relationships with them because she didn't have the foresight to realize other people would be affected by her choices. I told her I think she has been acting selfishly throughout this whole situation and that it has changed my perception of her as a person. 

I told her that she hurt me proposing this open relationship, but I accepted it to try to make her happy. I told her while I initially didn't want to be in an open relationship, I am actually enjoying being with other partners. 

I told her I love her, but I believe this relationship has been damaged beyond repair and I am not going to stop seeing others. I put her needs before my own before, but I no longer have the desire to do that anymore. 

After reading comments on here and reflecting on the entire situation I believe it is best that we part ways, so I told her I am moving out and ending the relationship. I told her she can stay in the apartment until the lease is up but I am moving out as soon as I find a new apartment. 


Tldr:

Girlfriend wanted open relationship

I reluctantly agreed

Girlfriend slept with at least one guy

I now have several FWBs

Girlfriend snooped my phone. Saw sexually explicit stuff

Girlfriend went ballistic and then started crying hysterically

Not sure how to console her or understand why she reacted like that",relationship_advice
My girlfriend hates men more and more with each passing day and it's making me feel uncomfortable.,"We've been together almost two years. She's always been a feminist and I've always supported feminism, but her views have grown more aggressive and extreme in recent months.

She's been saying that she hates men, and that all men are creepy, and that straight people are boring - she's pansexual, I'm straight. She recently said that it's proof attraction and sexuality isn't a choice, because there's no way she would actively choose to be attracted to cis men.

Instead of making me feel special, it all just makes me feel sad. I've never been with someone who hates whole groups of people like that, besides very obvious and logical ones like white supremacists and rapists. It bothers me. I'd be the last person to try to defend the entire male gender - I'm not interested in taking sides in any kind of gender war. It's just the negativity and the bashing and the insults that are starting to get to me. Maybe it's illogical and weird in this day and age to be a straight man who feels a little hurt when their partner jokes that straight men are a blight upon society, but if that's the case, then I guess I'm just illogical.

Is there any way I can talk to my girlfriend about toning down the hateful language without making it sound as though I'm against feminism and defending misogynistic men?

Thanks for reading.",relationship_advice
I (33m) overheard my girlfriend (28f) making fun of me pretty brutally to her best friend (27m). When I say brutally... I mean brutally.,"I originally posted this elsewhere, but it was deleted for whatever reason. I'm reposting so that I can link to it when I post the update. If that makes sense.

My girlfriend, ""Jenna"", and I have been together for 2 years, a little over.

I'm a veterinarian and we met at my office. She had just moved to the city and brought her dog in for an ear infection. We started talking and what should have been a 15 minute appointment turned into an hour long talking session.

I've never been so smitten with a woman before. Before Jenna, I lived the bachelor lifestyle. I was beginning to think I'd just stay single forever, even though that lifestyle of nothing but casual flings was growing really old and empty.

Jenna is a charismatic woman with a lot of friends. Her best friend is a guy, ""Dylan"", she knew in her old town. I trust Jenna but I'd be boldfaced lying if I said that her relationship with him doesn't bother me at all. I don't get angry with her or fight about it, she's reassured me that they've been friends their whole lives and have never had any sexual relationship.

I'm secure and I'm not insane, so I accept that they are friends and have tried to buddy up with him as well. He has visited the city 3 times. He's a cool guy, however, he does not seem to like me much. Jenna says he's just protective. It comes off a whole lot more like jealousy than protectiveness, in my opinion.

Jenna just finished up grad school this spring but she's had a really tough time finding a job. We have lived together for a year and I've been understanding that she can't help pay rent, etc. right now. I'm very financially secure so it isn't an issue, however, I am careful to not become a reason for her to not get a job and have her own financial independence. I just think it's important for everyone to have this sort of independence. So, without being pushy, I've let her know that she does need to start paying half of the expenses once she secures a job.

Anyway, she texted me at work on Monday to tell me she got a job. It's a job she really, really wanted and had to go through some pretty grueling interviews to get. I was so happy and proud of her that I decided to leave the rest of the day at the office up to my staff and took off early without telling Jenna.

I bought her favorite booze, grabbed a bunch of Chinese take out (her favorite), and bought her flowers.

I had bought her a nice necklace that she'd seen at a store a couple of weeks ago. Nothing super extravagant, but it has a shark on it and that woman is just obsessed with anything to do with sharks. I'd hidden it in the basement and figured I'd give it to her soon, totally surprise her with t once she'd forgotten about even seeing it in the store. I got home and came in the side entrance to the basement so I could grab the necklace and then surprise her.

When I came up the basement steps and opened the door, I could hear her talking on the phone. Normally I wouldn't stop and listen but I heard her laughing uncontrollably, like belly-laughing. It was pretty cute so I figured I'd wait for her to get off the phone before I surprised her.

She was talking to Dylan. Nothing new there, they talk at least once a week.

Then I heard what they were laughing about.

It took me a few dull minutes to realize that she was laughing about our sex life. She said something about how ""No, he can't even compare to (ex bf). Ex bf had at least 3 inches on him."" ""I feel bad every time I eat a baby carrot around him because it must be traumatic to see me chomping down on something the same size as him."" ""It would almost be cute if it didn't suck so much. His body is amazing as long as he keeps his boxers on."" Lots of laughter.

So look, I don't really give a crap what people on Reddit think about the, erm... size of my member... but, I do think it's important to say that what she was making fun of wasn't even true. Which in my opinion, makes it even more hurtful. I mean, I don't know about the ex bf, maybe he was a horse, but I'm very.... average. Just good old fashioned average. Not going to upsell myself here. It's nothing to write home about. But it's also not laughable. I've never felt self conscious, it is what it is.

To hear her ripping me apart to this guy that she knows I have some concern about was just beyond hurtful. Hurtful doesn't cover it.

She also made fun of me for being ""gorgeous but not super smart"".

Um... I'm actually highly educated. This isn't even remotely a concern of mine, I know I'm smart. Gorgeous and super smart with an average sized penis, thanks very much.

I left after that. Did I throw the flowers out of my car window? Yes. Did I cry in a parking lot? Yes.

I think she may have heard the basement door close, maybe she even saw my car driving away, because she started texting me pretty quickly after I left. Asking when I was coming home.

That was Monday and I haven't brought it up. I don't know how. I think I'm still processing everything. It's horribly embarrassing and hurtful. But... damn I love this girl. Not saying I'm going to forgive her necessarily, I just want to stress how hard this whole thing is for me.

I know I need to bring it up to her. But how? Any suggestions on how to start this conversation with her? I'm extremely hurt and I don't know if I can forgive her for this

tl;dr: My girlfriend made fun of me with her male friend. About our sex life/my penis. Pretty hurtful stuff. I feel like a puppy that just got kicked in the face. Joking aside, I'm devastated. I was planning to propose in the next few months. Now I don't see how I can even forgive her and stay with her. Advice?

Edit Wow, hey thanks everyone! I just wanted to add that I definitely will be breaking up with Jenna. I grabbed a beer with three of my friends tonight and told them. Their sentiments matched the majority of yours: dump her and do it quick. I called my mom and told her about it (yes, I told her everything, embarrassing as it was; we are pretty close and I wanted to tell her the whole story) and I've never heard her so angry about anything. She knew I'd bought a ring for Jenna. I will post an update after I do it (probably tomorrow), though it may take me a couple of days to post about it. I'm going to be pretty wrecked emotionally. Thanks again for all the comments/messages of support and encouragement, I really didn't expect everyone to be rooting for me like this!

"UPDATE: Logged onto Facebook, the first post that came up was a picture of my BF making out with another girl.","Original post here: https://redd.it/85bopp

First off, thank you to everyone for their kind words, stories and opinions! I am honestly speechless, you have all been wonderful!

I broke things off with him shortly after posting to this thread. I actually took a screenshot of the post on my phone and sent it to him with the caption ""bye"". I then deleted him off all of my social media and blocked his number from my phone. I have 0 intention on contacting him ever again. He doesn't deserve a chance to explain himself. A picture is worth a thousand words and there were five of them.

I messaged the woman who posted the photos in question on Facebook. I told her that the guy she was seeing was my ex and that he cheated on me with her. I told her that I in no way, shape, or form blame her for the cheating, since I doubted that she knew about me. I told her that my message was sent in peace and that if she choose to continue seeing him, I would not interfere. I thought she had the right to know his true colours.

The woman messaged me back and profusely apologized. She deleted the post and swiftly broke up with him as well. I have since learned, with her help, that he had been sleeping with various women since he was posted to Petawawa. So he's been cheating on me for at least two months. The woman and I are now friends.

I have no interest in dating right now, but I figure that I will give it another go in September, when I start my masters degree. I'm pumping the breaks on LDRs.

To the military men of Reddit: I will not count out dating a military man in the future just because one of you happened to be a rotten apple. I thank all of you (and the military women!) for your service and I hope that you find and SO worthy of your time.

A couple of people have chosen to bring up a previous post I made about not contacting your SO everyday. I 100% stand by my post and what I said. There needs to be some level of trust between you and your SO. If you prefer texting everyday, that's fine. If you're not a big texter, that's fine too! To each their own.

Again, thank you for everyone who cared to comment! You are all lovely people :)

(UPDATE) Boyfriend [29M] keeps asking me [24F] to let him do horrible things to me -- He actually did it,"Last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/addm05/boyfriend_29m_keeps_asking_me_24f_to_let_him_do/

After I posted, I had a lot of people tell me to leave him. I was hesitant to, but someone in a private message convinced me to at least pack an ""emergency bag"" just in case that had clothes that he wouldn't notice went missing. 

Then, after 3 years of ""joking"" he actually did something. While I was brushing my hair he came up behind me and hit me hard on the butt with a coat hanger. Then when I turned around, on the face. All while laughing like a lunatic. 

After that, he didn't hit me again. I snuck out that night when I didn't think he'd follow me. When he noticed I was gone he blew up my phone, trying to say he was sorry, didn't mean it, and that he needed to get help/was mentally ill. I called the police the next day. 

I wouldn't say anything much interesting has happened since. It's been about 2 weeks since then? Been living in a motel for a bit now. On the 2nd I am moving in to an apartment. Still kinda in shock, I think? Single for the first time since I was 18 and it should probably stay that way for a good long while. My face is mostly healed now.

Boyfriend (20M) started crying when I (19F) told him to wear a condom...,"My boyfriend and I have recently become sexually active. I am in the process of getting on BC but I heard condoms are very safe so I'm ok using them atm. Honestly don't wanna get on the pill bc im scared of gaining weight and I really like my body now. But even if I get on the pill, I'd like to continue using condoms for added protection. 

We've been having sex for like 2 months maybe and he's really annoying w condoms. Super annoying. Whiny and begs me to go bare and promises to buy me plan b. I'm not messing with my hormones bc of a dumb reason like that so I always make him wear one. He's good and puts it on but he does debate that I should let him go without. But I keep saying no and then he puts it on. 

We were talking today like doing foreplay or whatever trying to turn each other on lol. He started telling me that he wants to go bare and feel me 100% and saying I'd feel him better too. More graphic than that but ya lol. I told him no we can't do that u have to wear one, like always, and he legit started crying. Like whimpering and real tears falling from his face. I was like omg are you okay what happened etc. he said he just wants to do it so bad. I comforted him and told him I was getting BC soon and we can do it then but he just sobbed harder and said he couldn't wait that long and said he hates condoms with a passion 

I don't get it. Like he actually started crying over this. I just told him it was ok and to calm down and honestly it was kind of a turn off so we didn't even have sex. I love when he's emotional and cries but crying about condoms?? I was pretty confused. Does it sound like there's a serious reason for the aversion to condoms or is he just a horn ball and got overly emotional about it. I'm still so confused",relationship_advice
I [32F] just dropped out of my sisters[30F] wedding as her MOH after a blowout fight because her fiancé[40M] called me cheap,"Long story short they got engaged in March. He comes from a large traditional European household where money is a big thing for their wedding events. Throughout all of there wedding things I've been there for my sister every step of the way, helping in any way I can. I've spent well over a grand just being present in her wedding party trying to keep up. Both of them have good paying jobs and his family comes from a very well off household. I have one part time job and my parents aren't exactly considered ""well off.""

Obviously my contributions are no where near what his family is used to but I thought giving what I could and putting in extra leg work would be enough maybe? 

Anyways, for her shower I spent around 200$ and made her a 7ft x 6ft backdrop as a gift because it's something that she really wanted. It took over three months to make it by hand. The other girls in her wedding party are all from his side of the family and are what I could only describe as prissy rich girls. Every time I try and make a suggestion that's cheaper for an event or something contributing to their wedding I get snubbed or ignored. No other bridesmaids have even lifted a finger to help my sister other than make bougie ass opinions on what she should do or be(which is not her). I've felt pretty left out in this whole process but didn't want to say anything because although I don't agree with how things are going, I want them to be happy because I love them. 

So today I went to my sister and her fiancés house for coffee. And her fiancé made a snarky comment about how I didn't give them an envelope of money at her shower. I said my gift was their backdrop and I thought that was okay. I reminded him that I'm only working about 20 hours a week right now and I can barely afford to pay my bills(I got laid off in January from my second job I had). He then preceded to say that his dad keeps a chart of how much everyone contributes to them and they had to lie otherwise he would of gotten pissed. I thought this was absolutely atrocious. I told him that weddings aren't about money. They are about love and family. And I've even known people that have gotten married and accepted zero gifts and just wanted to be surrounded by the people they cared about to celebrate their love. 

We went back and fourth for a few until I felt so overwhelmed I left and said I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I electronically transferred my sister money from my credit card and now I can't pay my gas bill and told her I don't want to talk anymore. Maybe I overreacted but I was really upset. She's texted me a few times and says she doesn't want my money but I can't even right now. She said that their traditions aren't like ours and I said I'm not the one getting married so sorry for offending anyone's traditions so take what I gave you and count me out of anything else. 

I feel terrible. His family has completely taken over their entire wedding and has completely omitted our traditions as it is and now I'm expected to pay hundreds of dollars more than a thousand I've already spent for something I don't even want to be a part of anymore. I love my sister but she hasn't once stood up for me or our family(and our traditions) and I'm seeing her change right in front of me and it makes me so upset. 

I don't know what to do now or where to go from here. She's my only sister and I'm sure this will be her only wedding and I feel like I've just ruined everything. 

TL;DR I'm going broke being apart of my sisters wedding. Her fiancé called me cheap, we all got into it and I stormed out crying because I don't feel good enough. Having regrets now. Help.

**EDIT:** For all that were asking, his family is Serbian. And traditionally in his family they go to a lot of weddings and other events in their lifetime(seems like they have something going on almost every weekend for someone or something). His dad keeps a chart to keep track of how much money is given out so he can balance what they get in return. And **NO**, I do not agree with this. 

**EDIT 2:** My sister showed up at my house last night and apologized. She returned the money I transferred her and spoke with her fiancé. She said she wouldn't tolerate anything like this between our families. She let me know after speaking with her future husband that it's okay and will be okay if I can only give so much for the remaining duration of the wedding as she knows it's been a rough go for me this past year financially. She said he felt bad as we've all known each other for over 8 years and he wants to talk as he just reacted under the stress of his parents. I told her I needed some time away but I will still be her MOH. She said she understood why I was so upset and she will do her best to stand up for our family in the future. She admitted to getting lost in everything going on and was only trying to keep everyone happy.

2. Just to clear the air, i'm not a fucking bum. I've worked 3 jobs more than 12 hours a day for over 5 years. I paid my own way through school and everything I have, is the result of my own hard work and efforts. It's been more or less bad luck with job stuff this past year and I just now(as of last week) I have a second job again but it'll take time to catch up on things financially.",relationship_advice

BF lied about being HIV+,"[UPDATE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/acf2no/update_my_bf_lied_about_being_hiv/) 

I've been dating and sleeping with this guy for 3 months, and things have been getting serious lately. I got tested before we got together and he said he was clean too. But then the other night he said he was worried that he might have gotten HIV before we got together, cuz he was having symptoms and he slept with some sketchy dude a couple months before; so he got us both an at-home test. Mine was negative, but his came up positive. He acted totally surprised and upset. 

But then I found out from a mutual friend today that he has actually known he's had it for years. When I confronted him about it, he admitted to that and said he's been on ART for almost a year now. He said he didn't want to tell me before because he was scared I wouldn't want to be with him. 

I was shocked that he could keep something like that from me and let me have unprotected sex with him for this long without stopping to think of the consequences if he got me sick. I have a 2 year old son who lives at home with me too, which makes this seem even worse to me. Like how selfish and careless could you be?

BF says he wants to do whatever it takes to make this right, but I can't even look at him right now. What would you do? Drop him or give him another chance? 

I'm 31 M bi
He's 27 M gay

I [17F] stood up to my sister [20F] and my parents kicked me out for it.,"My sister Sienna bullies me and has done since I was little. She is my parents favourite. Pretty, smart, popular successful, etc. All I ever get told by my parents is to be like Sienna. Sienna can do awful things to me but my parents laugh it off. Yesterday she took my plate away at the table and said I should be losing weight not gaining it. They were laughing their heads off at this. 

Today I was on the phone to my boyfriend Aidan. Sienna has tried to make moves on him before. She thought it would be funny to snatch my phone and start flirting with him on it. He shouted at her to fuck off and told her to give it back to me. She then started asking if he'd like to know what he's missing by being with me and not her. He was getting angrier and angrier at this point. I kept trying to snatch the phone but she was too quick. 

Sienna has severe eye problems. Her glasses aren't regular glasses. She has to go to a specialist eye hospital because her eyesight is so bad. She has needed many surgeries and even with her glasses she can't drive and can only read close-up, and without them all she sees is blurred colours. 

I was told for as long as I remember to never touch Sienna's glasses. Rightfully so since she is completely blind without them, and understandably my parents were protective over her. To this day I've never broken this rule because I thought it would be a step too far. 

However, when she didn't give my phone back and was saying all that stuff to aidan I felt like crying, and I just grabbed her glasses and threw them to the other side of the room under a table. 

As soon as the glasses came off Sienna started crying. She dropped the phone and was begging me to get her glasses. I was so angry with her that I took the phone and went to Aidan's place. 

I got home earlier and my parents were home from work. Mum was hugging Sienna and soothing her and dad was furious. Apparently Sienna spent over an hour feeling around for her glasses, and mum had to find them for her. Sienna was still sobbing when I got home, and if I went anywhere near her she'd step back. It's like she's scared of me. 

Mum says that after what I did to ''our poor little girl'' I should stay somewhere else for a few nights, since Sienna doesn't feel safe with me here. I packed some stuff and went to stay with Aidan, which is where I'm typing this. 

I don't think I did anything wrong. She took my phone and tried it on with my boyfriend. I know I should've given the glasses back but it's not like I broke them or damaged them. 

Did I go too far and how do I win my parents trust back? 

TLDR:I stood up to my sister by taking her glasses, and now she doesn't feel safe with me and my parents have kicked me out because of it.",relationship_advice
"My (23F) BF (25M) wants to go on an annual ""gaycation"" where he ""becomes gay for a week"" ? Is this normal?","Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 1 year, but recently he suggested something that astonished and confused me. 

He wants to go on a 1 week ""gaycation"" with his best friend later this year, and he wants to make an annual thing.  I had never heard of this but he tells me it is when straight guys go on a trip and become gay for the duration of that trip, and are straight again when they come back. 

He says that during this trip he and his friend would basically look for other guys to have sex with, but that it ""wouldn't count"" because it would not be emotional, just physical, and that ""what happens on a gaycation doesn't count in the real world anyways."" 

Naturally I asked my boyfriend if he was gay or maybe a bisexual, but he acted offended when I said this and said it was just an annual 1 week ""bit of fun"" and that there was nothing gay about it, especially since it was only for 1 week a year. 

I don't know how to feel about this and it has caused quite a bit of argument with us. He insists it is normal and a lot of straight guys do it. This is my first serious boyfriend and aside from this one new issue everything has been great. 

Is it normal for straight guys to pretend to be gay for a week, and am I overreacting? Should I try to make a compromise? I'm very confused by this. 

TL;DR - My BF wants to go on a 1 week gaycation and I'm not sure how to feel or what to do.",relationship_advice
I'm (25M) intimidated by a (32F) woman I met,"So Friday night a friend invited me to a party at a very nice house. When I got there I met a woman and we hit it off really well, she was laughing at all my shitty jokes which just fuels my confidence. We were also very close and touchy throughout the night, and when the party ended we exchanged numbers. On the Uber ride home my friend was explaining to me that I was basically getting close with the owner of the really nice house, he's telling me how's she's some high level investment banker and how she's worth millions of dollars. As soon as I heard this I felt deflated, career wise this girl is leagues ahead of me. She's well educated and independent. I work as a service tech for hvac with no college education making pennies compared to her. I texted her this morning and she immediately says how much fun she had Friday night and how she wants to hangout again. I'm scared to respond, because now I feel like I have to act like I even deserve to be in her presence. What should I do to make these feelings go away?

Edit: Hey everyone! I'd like to thank you for all the awesome responses and words of advice and encouragement, Spent over an hour reading all the comments. Me and her texted and set up a date! The first date is Wednesday night, 
hopefully she continues to laugh at my shit jokes LOL. I'll post some updates later to let you guys know how it went",relationship_advice
"My parents don't like my boyfriend, I asked them if it was because he's black and they grounded me.","So, I(M17) recently came out to my parents. They were really supportive. Then I told them I was seeing someone. They were happy about that too. 

Few days ago he came to pick me up, my mom met him. I could tell instantly that she was acting weirdly. She just said hi to him quickly and went back to living room. I went out. 

When I came home my parents called me and started talking to me really seriously. Asking me stuff about my boyfriend. Where he lives, his parents, what school he goes too, etc. I answered everything and they said that they didn't like him. I don't see one single reason why they dislike him so I asked them. They couldn't answer me. Then I asked them if they seriously didn't like him because he's black and all hell broke loose. Ohohoo how dare I accuse them of being racists and think so low of them. Apparently I'm disrespecting them. But they still couldn't tell me the reason and now I got grounded for ""disrespecting"" them.",relationship_advice
Feeling embarrassed and ashamed (M31),"My wife (29F) and I (31M) have a one year old daughter, so sex has been infrequent to say the least. It's been nearly a month since our last time and we scheduled last night as a night to finally get back to it.

By the time we got to bed and I tried initiating I was quickly turned down. Frustrated, I rolled over and tried to sleep. A couple of minutes later my wife cuddled up close and was my big spoon, which felt nice. She then started rubbing my butt, which felt even better. This is the first time in a very long time that she has touched me in a remotely sexually way without me asking. Her hand then goes to my butt hole area (still outside of my shorts). I had no reaction to this, positive or negative. She pulls her hand away and says she thought touching me there would scare me and make me jump, and asked if I wanted her to finger me. I told her I would be down for it if she wanted to do it. I'm open to the idea.

She absolutely freaks out, jumps out of bed and is walking out of our bedroom saying she is going to sleep on the couch before I realize what is going on.

I tell her she's being ridiculous, and to come back to bed. We then cuddle until she falls asleep. I've felt like shit about myself all night and all day today. I feel ashamed and embarrassed for being ok with her touching me there. I've always told her I'm open to anything she wants to do with me or to me. I had no idea she was doing it to scare me.

Am I being dramatic or over sensitive about this? I'm not sure what I did wrong here.

TL;DR - My wife touched my ass, and I didn't freak out. Which freaked her out.",relationship_advice

UPDATE: I'm 13 and want to know what to get my girlfriend for Valentine's Day,"Here's a link to the original post on the situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apzmrc/im_13_and_want_to_know_what_to_do_for_my/ 


So here I am. Today was Valentine's Day and after a lot of deciding I went with getting my girlfriend a red rose, a yellow rose (her favorite color), a heart-shaped box of chocolates that had her favorite dark chocolate, a stuffed animal which I'm pretty sure was a little puppy holding a heart (if I remember right), a pair of valentine's fuzzy socks, and a homemade card. Before I get into what happened, I just want to say the card was an idea from online which can be found [here](https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/holidays/valentines-day/homemade-valentines?slide=508178#508178). I also included a message inside talking about how much she means to me and things like that. By the way, thanks to my mom who helped me get all of these gifts. To give her the gifts I put all of them in a bag except the roses which I handed to her separately.

Now to the part where I actually give her the things. So I waited until the end of the day while I kept everything in my locker (yes I had aluminium foil on the stems of the roses so they didn't dry out). Our final class is together and also kind of far away from our lockers (Which are close to each other) so we were one of the last people out of the school. Our lockers are also on the top floor so we exchanged gifts on the stairwell. I gave her the roses along with a comment which I thought was pretty good, I said, ""I tried to get the most perfect roses for the most perfect girl."" She really liked that one and I complimented her on her looks and I think she enjoyed that too. She handed me a bag with her present in it and I gave her my bag and we hugged. We walked each other to our buses and that was pretty much it. My bus driver congratulated me because he saw me with her as we were one of the last ones out. Throughout the whole experience I think she was pretty happy and after getting on the buses we texted and she said thanks and sent some hearts so overall it was a success. Also I forgot to mention she got me two containers full of chocolate chip cookies which I thought was really sweet because it shows she really put her time into it. I think that's all but I might be forgetting some things. Remind me in the comments if I left anything out!

Finally, I want to say thanks to everyone who left advice, suggestions, and comments encouraging me or helping me out. Once again I am astounded with the community on Reddit and you guys helped me out so much. Thank you everyone!!

I [15 f] just discovered my dad [51 m] is cheating while trying to buy him a father's day present,"I bought my dad a last minute father's day present off amazon prime this morning. I thought I was logged into my mom's account, but after I purchased it, I realized I was logged into my dad's account. So I went onto his ipad to delete the email saying what was purchased and it opened into a bunch of texts showing that he's cheating on my mom with his secretary who is like 10 years older than me.

I'm disgusted. I don't even want to look at him today. The worst thing too is that I'm supposed to introduce him at a big corporate award show next weekend. How am I supposed to get through this?

UPDATED: Do I need to get a new ring before I propose again?,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chgt65/do_i_need_to_get_a_new_ring_before_i_propose_again/

Thanks to everyone who commented on the last post. Someone suggested I take the ring for a cleaning, and get an extra diamond or something added, instead of a new ring. I liked this suggestion and I was going to do it but I ended up taking a different route.

I ended up talking to my mom about it and what she thought. She said proposing with a new ring is a no-go because I already did that and she already has one. She said the ring should be the centrepiece. She also said I shouldn't propose empty handed because there needs to be a reminder of the day she said yes, instead of only a reminder of the rejected proposal.

So we ended up going shopping and I settled on a nice silver heart locket which she helped me pick out. It was very pretty and fairly inexpensive compared to the ring and I was really happy with it.

I sat on it for a while until the time felt right. We were watching TV on Sunday night and having some wine and everything was really chill and it just felt right. So when I went to top up our glasses I grabbed the locket and I proposed to her on the lounge sofa. She cried, and she said yes :) I cried too and it was really beautiful and special.

Just wanted to provide an update to let you guys know it all worked out :) thanks",relationship_advice
My [M20] girlfriend [F19] of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. I am completely broken. I need some support.,"Hello everyone. This is not my main account on reddit.

I was in a relationship with my girlfriend for 7 years, she was 12 and I was 13 when we first met. Since then we never broke up, and we literally grew up together. Till the last moment we used to love each other a lot.

Ten days ago we were walking on the pavement and we were heading to the gym.  After some point, we see a huge truck heading towards us, most likely the driver lost the control of the it. My girlfriend was standing right next to me, on the right side. I managed to dodge the truck, but my girlfriend unfortunately didn't.. There is not much to say, and describing the whole incident is not an easy thing for me to do.. Basically her body was ripped apart..It was an instant death.

Since then I have been completely broken. I lost someone who was always by my side, always next to me for 7 years. My first love, and someone I thought I could spend my whole life with. She was so young, and that was really unfair..

I am currently studying Psychology at the University, but since her death I haven't attended any classes. I am home all day, no mood to do anything and I feel I will never get over it.. I can't help myself..My family and friends are next to me but still.. Every night I have dreams of her and of the whole incident..

I know I need to eventually move on, but it looks so hard for me.. Has any one of you lost their partner like that?

I need some support and some advices on how to handle this.. Thank you everyone.

Just Asked My (29M) Wife (26F) to Leave the House,"Throwaway account just to maintain anonymity.

Long backstory, because I've never talked to anyone about this.

So, almost a year ago, my wife, of now almost 7 years (no kids), shyly broached the conversation with me that she has discovered that shes also attracted to women. No big deal (she had made jokes before, so I suspected that it might be the case), and I love her no matter what. When she then asked if including another woman in our sex life, I said that while the seemingly ubiquitous threesome fantasy was something that intrigued me, I didn't think that it is something that would work for me, emotionally (I come from a very conservative rural area, and while a lot of my views have changed, I'm still very much a one-spouse man, and expect the same from her).

Two weeks later, we went out with some new friends. We were relatively new to the area where we live, so we've been trying to establish relationships with other married couples.  We met them at a bar, where we had a couple of drinks, and hopped in the car together to go to a different club (I'm DD for the night). While on the drive, the Other Wife (OW, 35-ish F) of the couple and mine kissed in the car.  Not super uncomfortable, I've been around damn near everything, so playing around doesnt get me to riled up.  However, after we leave the next place, both of them are pretty drunk, and they start making out in the back seat, undergarments were removed and mouths and hands were in places were in places with which I'm definitely not cool.

We come back to our house, at which point OW tries to escalate things, trying to rope Other Husband (OH, 35-ish M) and I in. He immediately recognizes that things aren't OK, and ushers her out the door. I'm fuming, and I leave, and dont come home until the next evening.  My wife and I have it out, and I express that what happened was not OK with me.  She swears that she doesnt remember me explicitly saying that it was something I wouldn't be OK with, let alone a whole second couple.  I also learn, after the fact, that the other couple are swingers, and have been for some time.

Again, from my upbringing, I'm a firm believer that your family, and particularly marriage, comes first, and that even the worst can be overcome.  She accepts that what happened wasn't OK, and we make up.  Over the course of the last 10 months or so, I've made an effort to understand her sexuality, and have even said that MAYBE, if the conditions were PERFECT, I might be willing to indulge her fantasies. By perfect, I explained that it had to include no social attachment  between us and any potential third, I'm not into having other men with us, and certainly no other couples.

Over this same time period, my wife and OW become friends.  They spend time together on a nearly daily basis in the gym, but its limited to pretty much that. I have my reservations, my wife reassures me, and I come to the conclusion that I can trust her, and that any suspicions that I have are just a result of getting burned the first time.  The issue is that the text constantly, and often at odd hours. I notice that our shared computer (to which she has her iMessages linked), has no record of my wife and OW or OH talking, which I know to not be the case (i.e. she blocked their conversations specifically from updating. I also now recognize the Other Couple's behavior as grooming. Each time, I try to rest assured that I'm just being paranoid, and that I can trust her.

Fast forward to last night. We're out with my friends (completely different friend group), and as the night progresses, and my wife gets more drunk, I (along with everyone else) notice that shes constantly on her phone. I also see OW's name at the top of the screen. Again, I'm DD for the night, so I'm sober as a judge. As the night draws to a close, my wife starts to nod off, passing out in the passenger seat next to me.  At this point, she passes out with her screen on, with the text drunkenly enlarged to max size, so that I can see that (this sounds like some bad TV drama writing it out) shes been texting OW about how she ""wanted last night"" and she wants ""to play with both of you."" I take her home and she comes to and climbs into bed before passing out.

Now my gut is in knots.  My worst suspicions are apparently true. Fearing what I expect to happen, I screenshot the messages and send them to my phone for record.  I'm then up all night long.

When she wakes up, I tell her that I want her out of the house by sundown. She tries to apologize for being distant and inattentive, but never addresses anyhing about OW.  I tell her to unlock her phone and show me her messages,  and (surprise) the messages have been deleted.  She asks what I'm looking for, and I show her the screenshot that I had sent to my phone.  I get angry, but stay collected, and again tell her to leave by 6pm. I get up and walk out, at which point she comes crying after me, telling me to stay.

I'm now away from the house, because I can't stand to be around her.  I'm not even sure why I'm posting this.  I dont talk about our marital problems to anyone because I hate the idea of the jaded guy who bitches about his wife, so I guess I thought I'd vent here. There's a part of me that has hope that after time, we can make things work, but I'm so angry at her and at myself for believing and trusting her, that I dont possibly see a path to repairing things.  Regardless, if anyone reads this, thanks for taking the time and letting me vent.  Any advice is welcome.",relationship_advice
Should I tell a stranger that his girlfriend is cheating on him?,"I had a one night stand with a girl without knowing that she had a boyfriend, she told me the next morning. If i was him I would have liked to know if my girlfriend was cheating. Do you think I should tell him?

EDIT This was my first reddit post and I was not expecting so many answers.

Since so many people commented I m going to give you a bit more details. I had a ons with this girl 2 months ago and at that point she did not have a bf.

But we live in different cities so I didn t see her for some weeks, then when I was back at her city I texted her to meet up  again, it s the morning after that we had slept together again that she told me about having a bf. I told her that there was no point in being with him since she s not happy and it s a that point that i first thought about telling him. She then agreed and told me that she ll end it with him and I believe she did. We saw each other for some days but I could not see her being my girlfriend because she had told me that she had cheated on all her previous boyfriends, so what we had was casual.

After that I saw her again a few weeks later but she had gotten back with her previous boyfriend who has no idea about me. The thing is that I feel sorry for him because she is his first gf and it ll destroy him if he finds out. That s why I m not sure what I should do, because on one hand it s none of business but on the other I would want to know if I was him. 

Now I ll answer some questions that I saw multiple times

I can t put a note under the toilet seat because she lives with her parents so the father will see it first

I have proof that shows that she cheated on him, I have messages from her saying he s terrible in bed and other stuff like that and that she doesn t love him and that she ll dump him

She told me his name so I can send him a message on fb, or if I see her again I can look up his number on her phone",relationship_advice
My (M25) new girlfriend (22F) just told me she sleeps with her best friend. Now I am conflicted.,"I've been seeing this girl for just about a month, and we came together in a random but beautiful way. I've grown quite fond of her, and her dog as well. Just last week, after meeting her friends, we had ""the talk"" and decided we would pursue a relationship with one another.

Due to her work schedule,  she has 2 weeks off upcoming. I asked her how she planned to spend these weeks, and she revealed she will travel to her old college town about 3 hours away to meet her school friend. When I asked if I had met this friend before in the bar, she replied that this male friend is her best friend. He ""saved her life"" when she was depressed in college, and is an important person for her. Sure, no problem I thought. Then she revealed she always has sex with him when she visits. 

I was shocked and played it off, and only waited until one day later to talk to her about it again. She doesn't see this guy but once a year, and is adamant that there are no romantic feelings there. I get a seriously weird vibe from this: Guy helped you when you tried to kill yourself, so now you owe (or give) him sex? Wtf. 

She says this is something I have to accept, but I wanted to have a good think before I make any decision. I really care for her and her little doggo, but this situation makes my stomach uneasy. 

Has anyone experienced this before? 

Edit 1: I went to her on her lunch break, and laid out how I really feel about this. How bullshit it is that she wants to have her cake and eat it too. I'm not forcing her to cut off contact with the guy who ""saved"" her, but she cant be fooling around with him and keep me around. She was taken aback by how I came out verbally swinging. She'll gather herself and we'll talk again tonight. 

Ps info: few have asked whats up with the dog: i was viciously attacked by a dog as a youth, and her dog is the only dog i ever let close to me. We all even sleep in my bed 😇 hence the attachment to him. 

UPDATE: She stuck to her guns, I stuck to mine. I ended our relationship amicably, and she will swing by around later to get whatever she left here, and i will kiss the dog one last time.

Thank you all for your comments and concerns,  I'm feeling sad but life goes on. 🤘🏿",relationship_advice
She expects me to cut off female friends but won't cut her male friends.,"I trust her around her guy friends but she tells me how they get touchy with her and pick her up. We work at the same place and if I'm not working she's hanging out with these guy friends. But she doesn't want me talking to other girls at work and I'm totally fine as long as she doesn't. 

Ive asked her to stop engaging more than convos with these friends but she can't do that for me so why should I. 

Any help?

EDIT: We've been dating for 8 months and we are both serious and both of us have real feelings for each other but what bothers me the most is she is engaging in more than just convos with these guys wether her intentions are just friendly it obviously won't sit right with me. 

UPDATE: We've talked and agreed that it's fine that we talk to the opposite gender, Ive asked her multiple times to keep it to a certain limit because I certainly only keep casual convos within work and that's it. I've heard from co-workers that she's always with other guys during her breaks and they've been touchy. And that my co-worker was confused that she was in relationship and doing what she is doing. 

She thinks all of this is fine because she tells me what is happening and she says she has no intentions that are sexual and are just ""friends"" and will not cut them off or even put a limit to it. 

And because I question her about this, she thinks I don't trust her.",relationship_advice
"Me (24F) and my boyfriend (26M) got into an argument about my ""lack of understanding"" of his favorite film.","Hi folks. First time poster, long time reader. 

I'll try and keep it pretty short and simple!

The other night, my boyfriend and I had our usual movie night and he BEGGED me to watch A Clockwork Orange, his favorite film, with him. I'd always heard of it, it's an incredibly popular film, but never knew the plot or anything really. 

I of course agreed. But quickly I realized that this was not my type of film at all. I'm a multiple sexual assault survivor and am incredibly triggered and uncomfortable during scenes of SA and violence. 

When I voiced this, asking him if maybe we could watch something else, he got irritated with me and told me I just ""had to finish it to really understand."" 

Again, I asked him to please turn it off. He did, very angrily, and then critizied me for not taking an interest in the things he likes. I found this to be incredibly unfair, as I have always gotten involved and excited about the things in his life. He continued to insult my intelligence and lack of understanding of the ""art of the film"" and I just left it at that.

He knows about my past traumas and has always been very sensitive and understanding about everything. I've never seen him like this and over a movie, no less. 

I'm just feeling hurt and confused and really not heard. He hasn't called to apologize or anything. It's just been total radio silence. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks so much for reading <3",relationship_advice
(final update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

I wasn't going to post anymore but I am still getting daily direct messages wanting to know how things are going.  I do appreciate the kind words and concerns.

But just so anyone who cares can know.  It is over.

I went to counseling with her on three different occasions and honestly I tried to have an open mind about it.  But at the end of the day the obstacle was just to much to overcome.

I even gave her an opportunity to walk back her statement or amend it or well do whatever she wanted to with it.  But instead she double downed in a way.  I think by that time she was very frustrated as well.

Neither of us are really happy about this.  It has been an absolute nightmare for me trying to avoid telling people/family why we are no longer together.  Of course I tried the old ""its none of your business"" to some of them but that failed spectacularly and since I refused to tell they decided she cheated on me and started spreading that around.  I've had to do a lot of damage control over that.  

I've decided to continue with therapy on a personal level because honestly this entire thing has really messed with my head and I have no self esteem left at all.  

I've only seen her once since we separated and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.  She is now, justifiably so, in the angry stage.  She is furious with me and has called me everything that you can imagine and then even made up some words.

tl;dr:  Its over.  I tried going to counseling and things only got worse.  ",relationship_advice
"Me [33M] with my Fiance[29f]. Together 6 years, she's rethinking our relationship because of advice from her recently reunited best friend [30F].","I and my fiance have been together for 6 years, engaged for about 8 months, and our wedding is scheduled for November. It's been a good, solid relationship from the beginning. We have great chemistry and have similar interests and principles. We are both doing well in our careers, have been saving money for our wedding and the down payment for our future house.

I'm going to try and keep the rest chronological, but there's a lot that I don't know.

My fiance (let's call her Beth) was best friends through school and uni with Sonia, that is for about 8 years. But then Sonia started dating a foreign student in their Uni and they got serious really quickly and got married within 6 months of dating. After their course was over Sonia moved with him back to his home country, and basically cut out Beth from her life. All of this happened before I met Beth, and from what she told me she was devastated when it happened, she would try to contact Sonia for years after and be totally ignored, and the hurt remained. Around last Christmas, Sonia came back to the UK and moved in with her parents. It was Sonia's mom who told Beth about her return, this happened in January. Beth went up to her parents during Easter, and since Sonia and her family were from the same town she tried to meet Sonia as well. That reunion did not go really well. Turns out Sonia's now ex-husband was extremely controlling and emotionally abusive and it took her a lot of effort to divorce and then move back home. Sonia was still recovering and would lash out at everyone including Beth. 

When Beth got back home she told me about it. She was deeply hurt and cried a lot, a lot of nasty things were said to her because Sonia blamed everyone from her life for her terrible relationship with her ex, special anger was reserved for Beth since she was around when she first started dating her ex and she should have somehow seen signs of the guy being the evil one he turned out to be. 

Beth still wanted to rekindle her friendship and they would write to each other a lot, there were ups and downs but over a couple of months, they did get back to a semblance of their old friendship. I and Beth went on a vacation in mid-June, three days before we were about to leave Beth invited Sonia and she agreed to join us. I found out about this the day before we were leaving and it annoyed me a lot. Firstly, the main reason we were going on this trip was because me and Beth were going to be really busy with work for the next few months and we needed to spend some time with each other, especially because there's going to be a lot of wedding stress coming up. And I was also annoyed because now I had to spend two weeks with someone who I had never met before, someone for whom my empathy was tempered by the fact that she was needlessly hurtful to my fiance. 

We arrived at a compromise. Sonia would join us for the first week of the vacation and Me and Beth would have the second week to ourselves.  From what Beth told me Sonia was ticked off by that and almost cancelled. But she didn't and the trip was a disaster from the beginning. 

We met at the airport and after a frosty hello, she simply talked to Beth the whole time. Any small talk that I attempted was rebuffed with monosyllabic responses or just shrug. When Sonia would need to tell me something she would talk to Beth, with me sitting right there. Like when she needed to go to the bathroom and I was sitting on the aisle seat, she turned to Beth and said: ""can you tell that guy to move, I need to pee"". Later in the hotel, when Me and Beth went to get Sonia for Lunch, she told her ""tell that guy that I'll just have room service"", I was the one who asked the question and I was standing right there. Worst was during the nights, Sonia said she didn't want to sleep alone and she didn't want to share a room with us. So Beth would sleep in Sonia's room and I would be alone. 

Beth wasn't happy about this behaviour either and told me that Sonia is very uncomfortable around men in general, so I should give her a wide berth. Then when I did that for a day, Beth came back to me and said that Sonia finds it very rude the way I've been ignoring her. I genuinely didn't know what to do, it ended up being me sitting around them while I was not included in their conversation and any conversation that I would try to have was shot down by Sonia. 

Beth would try and smooth things out but she was also caught in an uncomfortable position. It all came to a head on the second last day of Sonia's time with us. Beth has always wanted to go parasailing and our vacation spot was chosen specifically for a parasailing spot nearby which is supposed to be one of the most scenic ones in Europe. Sonia refused to join us of course. But then when we got to the spot, Sonia's mum called Beth and said that she just had a very worrying phone call with Sonia where she talked about suicide. So we rushed back, calling Sonia all the way back to the hotel when she didn't pick up multiple calls we called the hotel to check up on her for emergency reasons. Sonia was just fine, she told the hotel guys that her friends are just paranoid, and she told us that her mum was paranoid and she wasn't actually talking about committing suicide, just talking about suicide in general. Beth was fuming and they had an awful row. I found out two things during this row, firstly that Sonia was extremely manipulative even in the old days and that she had forced Beth to pay for her tickets and hotel room. While there was no real resolution to their argument, they stayed civil for the one day that Sonia was there afterwards, it was just us awkwardly watching TV in silence in our hotel rooms.   

Thankfully the non-Sonia part of our vacation was beautiful, while we didn't get to go parasailing again (you have to book at least 30 days in advance), we still had a great time doing all sorts of things and I've never felt more in love with Beth than that week. Beth also came to the resolution that she was going to take a step back from her friendship with Sonia for a while, at least till she apologises for her behaviour and pays Beth back. 

That resolution did not last long. 

We got back to London on the 23rd of June, and Beth left for her parents on the 27th without telling me. I walked into our empty flat and called her only to find out that she has been rethinking our relationship, and wanted some time to herself and that she would get in touch with me later. 

I was completely devastated, I had no inkling that this was on the cards and since Beth wasn't taking my call or responding to my messages I called Beth's mum, and she tells me that Beth isn't staying with them but with Sonia. So not only did she break her own resolution Beth also lied to me. 

The next time we spoke was on the 1st of this month when our rent was due and I texted her that she needs to send her half to the landlord.  She called me and said that though she'll send her share this month, she will also give her one month notice to remove herself from the lease. And that's how I found out that my fiance had decided to become my ex-fiance. I asked her why she was doing something this drastic without even giving us a chance to resolve whatever the problem was, she said she was going to send me an email detailing everything and that she had talked to her parents about this and they also thought that it was right for us to break up. I told her that I had talked to her mum earlier in the day and knew that she hadn't been in any sort of contact with her parents since she got to her hometown, Beth was extremely angry that I would talk to her mum and that it 'was very creepy to call a girls mum', I said that it would be very creepy if it was a random stranger, but when it's your fiance who left without any notice and then refuses to talk to you calling their parents is the obvious thing to do. An angry back and forth happened till finally, she admitted that she was with Sonia and she didn't want to tell me because she knew I was going to be annoyed about it and talk her out of it. 

On Monday, I finally get that email and its a total pile of shite. The main thing she says is that I'm controlling and that she can't spend the rest of her life with a guy like that. She used three different examples of my controlling behaviour: 

1. The vacation we just had, where I forced her and Sonia to go to all these museums and monuments that they didn't want to go to. Complete and utter bullshit, Beth has a degree in European History and these were places she had never visited before that play a big role in that history. Also, the fact that Beth had researched and found some of these places and bought tickets with literally no input from me.
2. That we'll be having a church wedding even though she isn't really religious and doesn't want to do that. Again, complete and utter bullshit. I had literally no say in the choice of venue, and the fact that the church that was chosen is the one that Beth's parents were married in might give a hint as to who chose that place.
3. That I shoot down all her proposals about flats that we might buy after the wedding and that I refuse to move to her hometown. This one is by far the weirdest. She has never made any proposals about flats we might buy, mainly because we don't even know what our budget will be until after the wedding expenses are dealt with. Also, she has never stated any desire to move back to her hometown, especially considering that her career is very much London based and would be improbable in her town.

&#x200B;

I sent my reply to her along these lines, less curtly and with a lot more pleading of course. I received no reply until last night when she said that she has come to the realisation that her parents are also very controlling and that she has decided to be low-contact with them. Her parents are wonderful people who have loved and supported Beth through thick and thin, this is what Beth has said to me all through our relationship until last night.

There's something massively wrong with Beth and Sonia has been a catalyst. This part I'm sure about because today morning I got a text from Sonia saying that whatever I may need to say to Beth has to go through her and that I should refrain from contacting Beth directly or they would go to the police.

Me and Beth's parents had a conversation earlier today and they want to go to the police about Sonia. I am not sure about that. It's been less than 20 days since me and Beth were snuggling and talking about what to name our future kids. I don't know whether I'm delusional or not, but I think this is just something temporary that she'll snap out of soon. I don't even know what I will say to the police, that Beth has been kidnapped by this tiny 5-foot woman who's brainwashed her into believing everyone else in her life is abusive and controlling? I know that Beth still picks up her own calls, maybe if she doesn't hang up as soon as she hears my voice I might be able to talk to her. But what do I say that might make a difference. 

I'm very very tired by all of this, haven't slept more than 2 hours a night since she left. I want to talk to her all the time but I have to hold myself back and not come across as the controlling person that I supposedly am. 

Any help or advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
I (24M) think I may have been raped by male friend (25M).,"I was too afraid and ashamed to share this by my regular account, but after seeing so many confessions I thought I had nothing left to lose, people have already made fun of me for thinking something like this could have happened. Even I am not exactly sure it did. I have had panic attacks ever since that day at just the possibility of this being true. I will try to include all the relevant events that took place to the best of my recollection without letting my feelings get the better of me again.

Anyway, here goes. I live in the same apartment with a roommate (25M). I've known him for almost a trimester and I'd consider him a friend. We are straight and with girlfriends, for what it's worth. The last few weeks we've had a rocky relationship but the most we've done is yell at each other for stuff and we always made up afterwards. He hasn't displayed troubling behavior for the most part but at times I've caught him staring oddly and he's made plenty of rape jokes which most of the friend group finds distasteful.

2 weeks ago a mutual friend of ours was celebrating his birthday and we were both invited. I don't remember drinking too much, but I have a memory gap extending to around 12 hours and I have no recollection of what happened during it. When I woke up I felt like I had been sleeping for centuries and every limb of mine was heavy and numb. I had difficulty sitting down, my back was aching and my muscles were sore.

After I managed to get up and look in the mirror I noticed, to my horror, that I had bruises on my abdomen and chest. I asked my roommate about it and told me I was so drunk last night that I had gotten into a fight over something stupid. This would explain most of the symptoms so I believed him.

The reason I say ""most of"" and not all symptoms is because I experienced discomfort when using the toilet and nightmares at night (which I never did in the past). I don't think a bar fight causes these.

Then I found out from the birthday boy himself that said bar fight never happened, or at least he doesn't remember it happening (to be fair he was pretty drunk too). He told me that I got wasted, slept on the chair and my roommate with another friend of ours carried me home.

I asked the other friend who carried me home with my roommate and he told me that they brought me to the apartment, got me on the bed and then he left. I asked him specifically whether they accidentally dropped me and I hit the floor which would explain the bruises but he told me that I never fell nor did they drop me.

A few days ago it dawned on me that we were buying rounds before I got the memory gap. I don't remember whether I specifically had a drink chosen for me or if I took a random one out of a disc but a sleeping substance would explain why I suddenly fell unconscious for so many hours and so suddenly.

I try to think of it more along the lines of a ""what if"" scenario rather than something certain because my life would be absolutely ruined if something like this happened. I don't know if I'd be able to survive it. Still, the nightmares continue and I've been crying during sex with my girlfriend, something I was thankfully able to hide, but this fear is increasingly growing inside of me.

Please don't tell me to call the police or anything like that, I'm not even sure I want to know and even if I do, I certainly wouldn't want the rest of the world to ever find out. I'm comfortable to share it with strangers on the internet, but nothing more than that. I took a week off to return to my family and stay with them until I get my thoughts in order.

Could my hunch be wrong? I could have had a bar fight and maybe nobody remembers because we were all drunk, and I could have nightmares because I'm trying to self-impose on myself that I was raped. That's possible, right? What would you do in my shoes?

**Tl;dr** I think roommate drugged me, raped me and lied about it, but I can't be sure, I feel terrible and I want to crawl into a corner and never leave it ever again.

**UPDATE:** Thank you for the encouraging words. There is a symptom I was too embarrassed to mention originally, but anonymity is a powerful thing. I had rectal bleeding the first time I use the bathroom after the event, along with a sense of discomfort. Also, my roommate has made jokes about roofying women before, on multiple occasions, for example about an unhelpful airport assistant.

**UPDATE #2:** Thank you all for your comments. I wish I could reply to each and every one of you seperately, you are really making a difference because you're the only ones I've shared this with so far. I was in a very dark place yesterday but now I'm trying to make sense of it all.

So I went to a doctor. I told her everything and she wanted to check my body and also examine me from behind. She told me that I had some tearings and small cuts/scratches that could signify sexual abuse, but since it is 8 days later already more than likely none of it can be conclusive evidence. For what it's worth she told me my mental state and physical symptoms seem suggestive of abuse...At least now I know that it was not all in my head.

She also drew some blood because I mainly wanted to get tested for STDs. Now I'm waiting, praying for the better. Hopefully even if that event did happen I won't get or transmit anything to anyone I wouldn't want to. I'm also planning on what to do with that fucking scum. I think I'll return and act normal just as long as I can search his room for evidence. Not sure what I'd even do with it, but I'm taking things one step at a time.",relationship_advice
My (29F) husband (31M) has been abusing our son (5M) for being left handed.,"Throwaway since people know my main account

My son has been learning how to write and I have been spending more time trying to teach him. He is left handed and up until this point, I never once considered it to be an issue. A few weeks ago, my husband proposed that he should be the one to teach our child how to write and even suggested that it would be a bonding experience for both of them. In fact, he made it clear that during this time, I should go out and enjoy myself since I don't go out that often. I thought everything was fine until I started to notice that over time, my son didn't want to practice writing anymore and would even start to throw full blown tantrums if I even suggested that we should start practicing again, which is unlike him. 

This morning, I managed to get him to open up to me and he told me that his dad would yell at him for being left handed, calling it bad and dirty, and would even pin his left arm behind his back really hard so he would be forced to use his right hand. I am devastated that this was happening right under my nose and I don't know what to do. I don't know how this was able to be hidden from me for so long and I've never even heard of being shamed for being left handed. He has clearly been negatively affected and I have yet to confront my SO about this but I don't know how to proceed.

Edit- for those wondering, my husband isn't with us at the moment and won't return from his trip until Tuesday. Sorry if I'm taking too long to respond, I've been trying to take my son's mind off of what's happened to him by playing games

Edit2- son is currently taking a small nap. I'm going to be packing our things into suitcases because I cannot stand to be in the this house. Don't know where we'll go so I'll have to sort it out later but we're not staying here

Edit3- Just got off the phone with BIL. Didn't tell him much except that there's a situation happening and asked if we could stay at his place. He said we're welcome to stay over  so that's where we'll be going in an hour

Edit4- made it to BILs house. Son is playing with cousin. In laws have not yet asked what happened. I feel terrible right now, like I'm actually going to vomit the more I think about what happened behind closed doors. That's not hyperbole. Thanks for the advice. I will possibly update within the next few days after everything goes down. Right now, I'm just going to lie down.",relationship_advice
Husband finally admits to sleeping with someone else after months of denying it,"So, I have posted here a few times before about me finding messages that my husband had sent a few other women here and there from the start of our relationship into us getting married. When I found the messages I begged for counseling, answers etc. and he didn't want to do any of it. I also had suspicions about him sleeping around because I got an STD. He blamed me and thought I gave it to him.

A few weeks ago, 4/5 months after telling him I knew about the messages, he finally admitted to sleeping with someone else, and now he's doing everything he can to make us better and to have a 'healthy' relationship. Everyone at work knows about the cheating, everyone on both sides of our families know.

And here I am not wanting to make this work, not wanting him at all. I'm actually repulsed by his touch. His side of the support system thinks I'm being unreasonable for filing for divorce, not wanting to make this work, or try to get back to how we used to be. But after me begging and bawling in front of him asking for answers he still didn't give it to me. Only when his counselor was at our house, he told me. In front of him and his wife.

Anyone have insight to this situation? Am I being an asshole? I feel it's justified, and I'm not happy with him. I wasn't happy with him before all this started either. Was I going to leave him? No. But this is a deal breaker for me and he knew from the beginning of us talking what my stance on cheating is.",relationship_advice
"Using a surrogate, feels more like husband is having a kid with another woman.","For various reasons, my husband and I had to use a surrogate and donor egg to try to have children. We ended up finding an old friend of mine who agreed to carry out of financial need (paying student loan debt). ""Our"" surrogate got pregnant on the first round and is currently in the 2nd trimester with twins. She is not using her own egg and this was by IVF, not sex.

I've never been pregnant nor is it possible, so I'll admit I think it's fascinating and I've asked her questions. But my spouse and our extended family are taking it to the next level.

My husband asks her for updates and how she's doing/feeling constantly. He asked HER how she thinks we should set up the nursery. He's tried to offer her a massage and probably would if I wasn't around. They've talked and she wants to breastfeed for a few months which he thinks is a great idea for the health benefits. The topic of vaccines came up (we're all very provax) and I made a joke about it, to which she said that I didn't deserve to be a mother if I wasn't in favor of vaccines. 

My parents and my spouse's parents are thrilled to be finally having a grandchild and absolutely dote on this woman. She was invited to come to lunch on Mother's Day with all the women and they all but showered her with affection and said nothing to me. I didn't need emotional fluffing but I got the message loud and clear that they only view me as a bankroll for the true mother.

I'm quite frankly tired of it. It feels like my husband is having an affair and a child with another woman and I can not only not be upset, but I also have to pay 1/2 the cost. I wouldn't have done this if it I knew it was just a very expensive way to become a stepmother.

I told my boyfriend (32m) that I (28f) was raped 10 years ago and he cant get over it.,"Okay, so, about 5 months ago my boyfriend and I were up late one weekend drinking and talking for hours (which we do often). Somehow, we came to a topic that led me to tell him that I had once been raped when I was 18. I had just turned 18 at the time and so this was something that happened over 10 years ago. It was terrible, the worst experience of ny life. I was just days past my 18th birthday when I was raped by 3 different men at a huge new year's eve party. I was young and didn't know what to do, so I just didn't tell anyone and dealt with the emotional aftermath on my own. 

I had never told anyone about this before but I felt comfortable enough to tell him about it. After it happened it took some time but I obviously healed from it, moved on and put it somewhere far back in my mind where I really didn't often visit it. I think I dealt with it in a reasonably healthy way considering and I'm okay today... mind you this is over 10 years later. 

Here's the problem... now he keeps bringing it up pretty much every two weeks, at least. He questions me for more details to the point I've told him every detail about it I can remember. This is not fun and really very uncomfortable for me. I discuss it with him because he tells me that it deeply bothers him and makes him angry at who did it to me and that there's nothing he can do... he has a list of reasons why it bothers him so much, including that it has caused him ro no longer see me as ""perfect"" in his eye, which he says I was before. 

When he gets upset about this he will distance himself and become really unpleasant and grumpy... and he honestly appears borderline depressed. I have talked with him about it a lot in the hopes he could move past it but it doesn't seem to be happening. I really don't know what to do at this point and I don't feel like it's fair to me to be put through reliving this every couple of weeks, or that I should have to feel bad about something that I was a victim of. He makes me feel like I'm tainted and less lovable or acceptable now. We have talked about breaking up if he can't move on. 

Are his feelings understandable? Should I continue to try to help him move past it? Or am I right to be upset? I honestly think it's ridiculous at this point. We are both adults and I certainly understand the world is not perfect, nor are people, bad things happen to good people every day and we learn from them, do something if we can, and keep moving in a forward direction. I also am aware how many other women have gone through terrible situations similar to mine. I'm tired of feeling like I'm on trial in my own relationship. I'm upset that he's making things about him, I feel like it's selfish. I went through it 10 years ago and I need to move the f... on. ",relationship_advice
I [20/m] woke up to my friend [23/m] having opened my pants and groping my penis,"I'm part of a very tightly knit friend group. We've all known eachother since our teens, and there's a lot of banter, but also a lot of maturity and respect - especially considering it's a group of young men.  

Now, one of us, we'll call him Tim, is openly gay. Tim has been out of the closet for as long as we've known him, and along with being one of the oldest in the group, he is also one of the smartest. He's usually very down to earth, and not very flamboyant, so usually his sexuality is never the focus of any attention, and we pay it no mind.  

However, yesterday night I was out 5-6 people of this group of friends for beers - and we had a lot. When the night came to a close at around 5-6 AM, people started taking taxis and walking home. I live the furthest away from the city, so I had quite a long walk in front of me. This is when Tim asked if I wanted to crash at his place, then I could take the bus once I woke up. Without me even asking about it, he assured me ""don't worry, I won't try anything"".  

So we went to his place, had another beer and went to bed in his kingsize bed. I had kept all of my clothes on, as I had basically just passed out once I laid down. I woke up to Tim with his hand in my pants, groping my penis. Not only had he rolled all the way over to spoon me. He had unbuckled my belt, opened the button in my pants, and opened the zipper (so this was not just some shit that happens spontaneously in your sleep). I told him to stop, and he did, and apologized. I went to the bathroom to get some water and left without going back in to his room to say anything.  

Now, I've not told anyone. Not even my roommate who is also a friend of Tim's or my girlfriend. I am ashamed, and I feel disgusted that he would do this. Tim wrote a short text apologizing, but I couldn't get myself to respond to it. It feels like this is beyond an apology.  

Now my dilemma is this. How do I respond to Tim? I don't know what to tell him and I don't know if I can salvage this. I also don't know if I can tell my friends about it, because they're all friends with Tim as well, and I think I'm afraid that this will ruin the otherwise great dynamic of this group of friends. Perhaps I am also afraid of shunning him completely from the group, which I fear might be a consequence if the others found out.  

That turned out a lot longer than expected, but again, this is the first time I talk about it, so it just all had to go out. All help is appreciated.",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] [21F] I went out last night, and ended up in an acquaintances bed [23M]. I think I was drugged or something and I think we had sex","First off I'd like to thank all of you for being so kind and loving. 
Second, I wasn't accusing him in the last post
Third, it was the guys from the club.

Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7rqt9n/21f_i_went_out_last_night_and_ended_up_in_an/

After I made that post, I was at the acquaintances house for a bit he offered me an iV to rehydrate me and pancakes. I said no. My phone charged up, I made the post and apparently it died because he was calling random people from my phone to pick me up until it died. I was trying to figure out how he unlocked it but obviously it was pretty easy to just put my finger on the home button because I was out.

My phone was blowing up when from all the late calls and stuff of people calling me back because he called them. They were coming in late because they were backed up, some are still coming in

 He took me back to my car at the club and he called my best friend to come too so she could drive for me because he didn't think I was awake enough to drive. 

 I told her what happened and she took me to the hospital, she's pretty mad at him for not taking me to her house but she didn't answer the phone so why would he.
 
We had to go to a hospital that's far because I didn't want to go to the one near us because he's a phlebotomist there and I didn't even want him to see me there doing anything and just in case it was him he couldn't tamper with anything. 

They did a rape kit and toxicology. It took forver and they're not going to get the results till god knows when.

 The rape kit didn't find any semen or anything hair or anything like that but they swabbed anyways and sent it to be tested.

They did find tissue trauma, which is why I'm sore which means I was penetrated by something.

We were there for hours and he called my friend and told her when he dropped me off he went inside the club to ask about the cameras
He knows the manager and told her what happened so she let him see the footage and he sent it to us. 

  They weren't very clear but you could see what was going on, I was with the 3 guys after we had finished talking and They were taking turns dancing with me and grabbing me and stuff that goes on for about an hour then I can't stand anymore and they were throwing me around and reaching under my dress while the other one kept me standing up. That went on for like 30 minutes then he showed up and he grabbed me by the hand and was like dragging me then one of the guys shoved him then he hit the guy and picked me up and carried me out over his shoulder, then in the parking lot he threw me into his car and left. That was around 2 am.

It amazes me that he was just able to walk out with me over his shoulder and no one even said anything or looked twice.

He lives about 40 minutes away from the club. 50 minutes after the stamped time that he left the club is when the phone calls from my phone started. The phone calls spam over about a 3 hour period till 5 am. 

He couldn't of done anything to me in that time because he was either driving or calling people. 

I woke up this morning at around 9 and made the post so i assume he was sleeping those 4 hours and I already saw it was those guys on the video.

Thank god for him!! Now I'm going home to shower and stuff and he's been checking in on me through my best friend 
 I'm going to report it but the videos aren't clear enough to really see who it is but they stoodout in our area because they had very black hair and they had on matching shirts so hopefully someone can identity them ",relationship_advice
My (27M) girlfriend (26F) played a prank on me and is upset that I yelled at her,"I was sleeping over at my girlfriend's house and she suddenly woke me up at 3 am with this alarm sound blaring like ""that's the fire alarm, we have to get out, hurry up,"" I was half asleep and fucking freaked out and ran outside. And when we were in her backyard, she showed me the alarm sound. It was from her fucking iPhone, the loud fire alarm sounding one. No I didn't realize it sounded fake, I was asleep and thought we were gonna burn in a fire. I yelled at her because I had to wake up for work at 5 and she ruined my sleep and it was just a fucking random and pointless prank. We play around sometimes but this was unprompted. 

She got quiet and said sorry and I thought she felt bad so I didn't push it and we went back inside. I then left to work a few hours later and texted her after if I should come over. She said no and I asked her why and said I wanted to see her because I missed her and I tried sending her some dirty texts and she texted exactly this:

""No because you hurt my feelings. You did not have to yell at me like that. It was a joke and I thought you would find it funny and you blew up like an insane person. You are a psycho and I'm honestly scared of you now. Please don't come over. Good night"" 

What the fuck. How am I a psycho? She's the one blaring alarms in my ear and making me run out the house when she knew I was getting up early for work.",relationship_advice
"UPDATE - My GF (28F) Joked About Male Enlargement Pills, I (28M) Brushed it Off.... Two Days Later She Says ""I Bought You Something..""","Dear redditors, see the [original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljukt/my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement_pills_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) (I am able to see it, but not sure if others are who are saying ""post removed."") So here is recap:

**TL;DR:  GF of two years sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. I thought she was just joking so I ""LOL'd,"" said no, and brushed it off. When I saw her two days after, she said ""I have something for you."" To my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills. She didn't consult with me or asked I was okay with taking them, etc She kept pushed the pills on me and I told her the pills don't work and the to leave. I am comfortable with my size, but I guess she wants more.**

I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who gave amazing feedback and told me to stay the hell away from those pills, admired my confidence in sharing my penis size, and told me to communicate. I did not take, and do not plan on taking them now or ever in my life. I also want to thank those who said talk with her and offer solutions such as sheath/sleeve to help her fulfill her fantasy.

We had a serious conversation. She knew she fucked and admitted that she at no point took my thoughts and feeling into consideration and she regretted that. I told her what many of you said, to consider my health if I were to actually take those pills. I showed her examples of what could happen with all the chemicals and other crap those things have. I even told her those damn things could give me a heart attack or worse. She started crying as if I had died and jumped in hugged me super hard and asked me to please forgive her and that she would not want anything to happen to me or put my health in jeopardy. To help her understand why I told her to leave when she gave me the pills, I showed her my original post and let her see the comments all of you provided... In the end, I forgave her.

I just want to end it by saying that this was a good test in our relationship. We actually got intimate after and both of us did not have an issue getting pleasure (shocking, I know). Now she is giving me more attention, spoiling the shit out of me, and showing how much she appreciates me. :)

P.S. To all the haters in the comments from the original post saying ""fake,"" ""you have a small dick,"" ""take the pills,""""what kind of gf talks like that, this is a porno,"" etc..., all I have to say is: Keep hating you lonely bastards. Love you!",relationship_advice
UPDATE: My [30m] Wife [30f] lied to me about where she was.,"Me again. I was asked for updates by a lot of you to this situation and for the most part everyone is really kind and helpful and I can't tank you all enough. Not a lot has changed but there is more and more that add to my suspicion that my wife is cheating on me, details below. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aimwwu/my_30_m_wife_30_f_lied_to_me_about_where_she_was


I went out of town this past weekend on a work trip leaving my wife alone for a few nights, something I wasn't looking forward given my suspicions. I decided not to confront her about it and just collect more evidence, if I found nothing I would just ask here where she was on MLK day but if I found more I'd rather her not know I know.

Wednesday night she was supposed to go to the library and then to the gym right after just like on Monday, but when I got home from work she was already back at the house. I asked her why she skipped on the plans for the day and she just said ""oh I changed my mind, just staying in tonight."" It is pretty rare of her to miss a gym night anyway and when she does it's usually for a more substantial reason. Anyway, the rest of the week went as normal as can be expected and I left Friday night for my trip.

We didn't talk much over the weekend, just a phone call here or there and the occasional text, but I did have my friend run by my house just to see if anyone was home, strange car in the driveway, etc. He knew the situation and was happy to make a small drive over. He said her car wasn't there Saturday evening when he drove by and when he passed our house on the way to church the next morning it wasn't there as well. Before all you sleuths ask, yes we have a garage but it's packed with Christmas decorations that I haven't put away yet, she parks outside for now. We also all go to the same church and my friend said she wasn't there either. 

Last night I got home and the house looked exactly like how I left it. No dishes used, no takeout bags or boxes, even the bed looked how I remember leaving it. It doesn't look like she was at the house all weekend. When I asked her how her weekend went she just smiled and said ""relaxing"", and that's all.

No smoking gun, just a lot more ""that doesn't sound/look good"" kind of moments. I know it's not the dramatic update you all were looking for but it's what I got... Till next time I guess.",relationship_advice
"Wife's [29/F] ""Frenemy"" [30/F] sent me an email outlining my wife's attempt to reconcile with her Ex [35/M] (and sleeping with him) as we were getting more serious. I'm at work and don't know how to respond to any of this.","My wife \[29/F\] and I \[28/M\] have been together for 4 years and married less than a year. Let me also preface this by saying I have a cold and am in desperate need of sleep. 

My wife, Katie, and I, started dating when I was in grad school. We were in the same social circle. She was in a relationship with a guy we'll like ""Mike"" and it was clear it wasn't going to work long-term. Mike was a ""free spirit"" and had a lot of personal issues, so none of us were surprised when they broke up. He decided to go on a retreat/road trip with his ex-girlfriend for six months and disappeared. She got over the relationship and about a year later we started dating. It was an odd coupling, we're very 'different' – she's a lot more artistic and free than I am; we're on different levels in the looks departments and many of the things that make us who we are, are seemingly opposites. I'm more buttoned-up and traditional and she's not. A couple of months in, we hit a rough patch but we worked through it. From then on, things were great. We moved in, I proposed, we got married and that brings us to today where we're trying for a kid. 

My wife's frenemy ""Danielle"" has never really been supportive of our relationship and they've been friends since middle school but have had several falling-outs over the years. Recently my wife couldn't/didn't attend an event hosted by Danielle, which prompted this recent outburst and along with it the end of their friendship. Danielle sent me an email saying that when Katie and I got together, she was unsure of which person to choose so when Mike returned, she went to him to talk about them. They met a few times during the first two weeks he was back and apparently had sex ""once or twice"". According to Danielle, Katie ended it and never told me anything about it. She confided in Danielle about it, years ago, and I guess thought the matter was closed. I got the email this morning at 10 and was surprised Danielle emailed me and read it. Probably 30 minutes later I get texts from my wife asking if I got an email from Danielle, and did I read it. When I answered in the affirmative, she sent me a deluge of long texts explaining that it did happen, they had sex once and had coffee three times and that she hasn't spoken to him since. I'm not sure what to respond. 

I have a cold, and have been trying to get work done so I can rest when I get home. I don't even know how to deal with this. Part of me wants to go home, get into bed and sleep, pretending I never found out. Another part of me is furious that she hid this from me – I had a feeling she had seen her ex, but she then came to me a week or so later and wanted me to confirm we were exclusive and I wasn't seeing anyone else. Part of me is terribly mad at Danielle for dragging this shit up years later. I don't know what to do here. 

Is this that bad of a transgression? It feels like it was so far in the past that I don't know how to respond to my wife or Danielle.",relationship_advice
My (23f) bf (23m) hasn't been there for me through a family emergency. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I should just call it. Please help.,"I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed at the moment so I'm sorry this might be a bit rambling.

My (23f) boyfriend (23m) is a quiet, introverted person. I knew this before I started dating him, but I kept thinking he would open up to me and we would have more to talk about, become closer, with time. 

We've been dating for about 6 months and ""official"" for 2. But the thing is that our relationship is already lacking a lot of the things I feel I need, but I've procrastinated saying anything in the hopes it would just improve.

For example, he's not very affectionate, unless I initiate it we don't hug, hold hands often, things like that. Except cuddling on the couch, or holding hands in the car. I don't mean I want him to be all over me, but if we're with other people he stays like a foot away from me. we went on a date last week, and he walked ahead of me on the sidewalk. 

If we talk on the phone, he never has anything to say unless it's answering a specific question. He has nothing to say about his day, nothing to share unless I ask him to describe something or teach me about something. at first it was fine, but I'm getting really sick of the silence. If I'm not talking then there's just nothing. 

I've been ruminating for weeks on how to bring it up without sounding like I want to break up. Because I do like him, and I was willing to work towards becoming closer, etc. But now I don't know what to do or what I want to do.

On Monday, my uncle (who I've always been close to) was hospitalized. Yesterday he was moved to ICU at a major hospital near us.

I texted my bf because I was feeling anxious and overwhelmed by all the emotions and helping my aunt and cousins, on top of being at work. I sent him a text in the morning and all he said was two words referring to our plans for this upcoming weekend. I was heading into work and on the verge of a breakdown, and I just replied ""helpful."" 

I took a long lunch to spend at the hospital, and then went back after work. During the day, I was just keeping it together. My coworkers were so helpful and offered me candy, coffee, anything they could do to help. One of my good friends texted me in the afternoon because he knew I was anxious from the night before. 

Really the only person who showed no interest in how I was feeling was my bf. He never followed up with ""how are you feeling?"" ""how's your day"" or asking about my family or anything.

I got home from the hospital after 8:30 and he still hadn't messaged me from 8am. So I tried calling him, and he didn't pick up. So I just snapped and messaged him saying how I don't appreciate feeling like my bf doesn't care and that i told him how I felt and he had nothing to say, etc.

All he replied was he didn't get any texts after ""helpful"" - because he wasn't being helpful! So I responded that I don't want to beg him to care or pay attention when I tell him I'm upset. That what I told him what was up and he didn't even care to ask if it was ok.

He turned off his phone between saying sorry and my response, saw the messages this morning ( read receipt) and I still haven't heard from him.

My uncle died over night. I'm on my way to be with my aunt and cousins now, and feeling just overwhelmed and obviously so sad, but I'm trying to keep it together for my family. 

what sucks is I could really use a little moral support. And I don't want to be with someone I can't count on. 

I don't even know what I want him to respond. I don't think anything he says is going to make me feel better about this situation and I don't want to be with someone who doesn't care about me. 

I don't know if I'm overreacting because I'm emotional or if I'm just finally seeing what a relationship with this person is like. 

Any outside perspective would be really helpful.",relationship_advice
FINAL UPDATE: Fiance (30f) deleted old conversations after I (32m) found them. What do?,"**Original Post [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b47nc2/fiance_30f_deleted_old_conversations_after_i_32m/)**

**Update from 2 weeks ago [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b53wfq/update_fiance_30f_deleted_old_conversations_after/)**

So it's been 3 weeks since the shit hit the fan.  I moved out all of my clothes and necessary items to my parent's house a few towns over.  As far as I know, she's still there.  I haven't spoken to her in almost 2 weeks.  I have to go back to get a few more things before the end of my broken lease (about 30 days left). Sounds cliche but I'm going to leave everything else there because a lot of it would probably remind me of her.  

I found a place near my office that I'm moving into May 1st.  It's a bit smaller, but it's closer to my office.  My friends have been great, allowing me to spend time at their houses just to hang out.  My parents have always been lovely and supportive and I thank god that I have the family and friends that I do.

When life slows down, and it gets quiet - my emotions creep up.  This is a woman who I loved so dearly and truly.  I wanted to build a beautiful life with her.  Wanted to have children, buy a house and do all the fantastical things that partners do.  I am, however able to reflect on the lies and the deception and her true character and that can snap me out of feeling remorseful for breaking it off with her.

One thing that has helped - I started to see another woman very casually.  She's not really my type, but she is very very attractive.  I told her that I was very far from looking for anything committed or serious, and she is in the same boat.  She basically just wants to sleep with me.   

Before I met my ex-fiance, I was somewhat of a ""hit"" with women.  My ex was the woman who made me immediately disinterested in talking to, being physical with or spending time with any other woman.  I have confidence that I will find another woman like this.  Until then, I will continue to be an adult and have casual relationships like I used to.  

To sum things up:  I am heartbroken.  Some days are better than others, but I keep pressing forward and focusing on my day to day for now.  My goals will change and my focus is shifting back to myself instead of a partner.  To anyone else who is going through similar:  Carry on.  Pick your head up, look yourself in the mirror and realize that as long as you work very hard at being the best version of yourself- you will attract the right people into your life.  And sometimes, someone might seem like the right person even though they're not.  But do not compromise your own self-worth and self-respect for someone else.  Hold your ground and be the best you possible.

Thank you all very much for your words and support.  Goodbye.

"I (26M) Have A Date With A Legally Blind Girl (25F) In One Hour. What Are Some OK Things To Ask About Her Vision, And What Are Some Things I Should Avoid Doing/Saying?","I'm not a complete idiot, but I'm not exactly bright either. What things should/shouldn't I do, and what should I avoid asking? Is it OK to offer her help (e.g. linking arms) rather than her relying on her stick? can I ask 'how blind are you?'? Would it be OK to touch her arm or something when I greet her when she may not be expecting it?  


Update: Things went pretty well. Thanks for your advice, everyone. She was cool talking about her vision but we only really mentioned it when it was relevant to the conversation. She's a keen traveller and writer and we have a kind of similar taste in books and TV, similar humour etc. She's moving to another city really soon but she won't be a million miles away so I think I'll try and keep things going. I've never really had any interaction with anyone with a disability before, so it was good to put my stupid apprehensions and awkwardness to rest too. She seemed up for meeting again so hopefully we can sort something out before she moves.",relationship_advice

Update:

I had a talk with my daughter today and asked her some casual questions about her former teacher (in a way/tone that a curious friend would ask, not an overbearing mother). Thankfully I was able to get her to open up more about her relationship with Mr. Smith.

I saw her grinning to herself while messaging someone on her phone again so I took that as an opportunity to casually bring up her teacher. I said something along the lines of ""Oh, are you chatting with Mr Smith again?"" To which she replied ""No, just my friend 'Shannon'. What made you think that?"" I told her that I noticed she usually smiles like that when she talks to Mr Smith, which made her embarrassedly say, ""oh... yeah. I like talking to him.""

I then said to her, ""Speaking of Mr Smith... how is he doing? I know you hung out with him for a while the other day. You must have had a pretty nice talk then!"" She instantly lit up when I brought this up and she finally started to give me details. She said that she always loves seeing him because he's one of the only people she can talk to for hours on end like that and not get bored. She told me that they met up at a coffee shop and just spent the whole day there chatting and catching up. To this I asked her ""You don't feel weird hanging out with an old teacher of yours outside of school?"" She said it didn't seem weird to her at all even though she knows other people might find it a little strange. She also added, ""Maybe if I came across another student and teacher hanging out together like that I might question it, but I've always seen my relationship with Mr Smith as being a little different."" I asked her how she views their relationship and she said she looks at him as being more of a friend than a teacher.

I decided to push things a little further at this point and asked her ""have you ever seen him as being more than a friend?"" She paused for a while and I could see her gears turning. She finally said ""I'm not sure honestly."" She explained that she has a feeling of love for him that she hasn't felt before, but she doesn't think it's a romantic love. She said he just means a lot to her and she can't imagine not having him in her life. She admitted that sometimes she feels like she has a bit of a crush on him but that at the same time she could never really see herself kissing him or being in a relationship with him. She said her best way of describing it is that he has set the standard for what she wants in a future partner but that she doesn't actually want him in that way.

The one last bit of information I was hoping to find out from her was if in her opinion Mr. Smith had ever shown romantic interest in her, so I asked ""Do you think he has any feelings for you? I mean you've spent a lot of time together and he definitely sees you differently than he sees his other students. He even gave you that perfume as a gift, which seems somewhat flirtatious to me."" She told me that she's never felt like he's shown interest in her in that way. She said that they tease each other a lot which might come off as being flirtatious but that it's all innocent. She also added that he's happily married and has a family. I brought up how she used to say that he would complain to her about his wife but my daughter said his marriage was just going through a rough patch at the same time that my daughter was struggling with depression, so they confided in each other and bonded over that, but things have improved a lot since then. She also explained that his wife is aware of his friendship with my daughter, and that his wife is actually the one who suggested he give my daughter the perfume. Apparently someone had bought it for her but she didn't like the scent, so she asked her husband if he wanted to see if my daughter liked it and wanted to have it so it wouldn't go to waste.

Throughout my conversation with my daughter I never once felt like she was trying to deceive me or hide something from me. As far as I know, she's always been very honest with me and she's never given me any reason to question her trustworthiness. While I'm still not certain that her unusually close friendship with her teacher is the best thing for her, she is an adult and I feel I should let her make her own decisions and her own mistakes and let her learn from them on her own, so I don't plan to intervene unless at any point I start to feel like she is unknowingly putting her physical or mental health at risk. If any more concerns do arise, I will be sure to talk it out with her first and I will not take any action on it behind her back. I made sure to reassure my daughter that I am always here for her if she wants or needs to talk about anything like this in the future.

Some of you may feel that I am a bad parent for not trying to dig deeper or for not trying to intervene in any way, but I truly feel that I've done all that I need to at this point, and I'm very happy that I made the decision to handle this in the way I did. Feel free to ask me more questions if you like, but any more advice isn't really necessary at this point. Thank you once more for all of the suggestions that you gave me in my last post. I feel so relieved to finally have this matter resolved.



TL;DR: I had a long discussion with my daughter about her relationship with her teacher and she opened up about it and answered all of the questions I had. She doesn't seem to be involved in anything more than a close platonic friendship with him, and I have no valid reason to believe that he is grooming her or taking advantage of her in any way. I don't plan to intervene in their relationship and I let my daughter know that I'm always here for her to talk to about this or anything else in the future.

!!! EDIT:

Someone made the suggestion that I invite Mr. Smith and his wife over for dinner one day. I talked to my daughter about this and she was happy with the idea, so she sent him a message about it.

Mr. Smith replied saying he would be ""more than happy"" to join us for dinner but that his wife ""sadly won't be able to make it because she has been extremely busy lately."" This is a huge red flag to me, especially considering that we didn't even give him a set date, just said ""someday soon.""

I will be having another conversation with my daughter expressing my concerns to her and sharing the potential dangers if she were to ""hypothetically"" become involved with Mr. Smith romantically. I'm now also considering having a word with Mr. Smith about his relationship with my daughter. Whether or not my daughter is aware of it, there is no doubt something more going on here.",relationship_advice
My[28M] wife[26F] got tested for STDs the same afternoon that she returned from an 8-week long business trip. Used a solo shopping trip to conceal the appointment.,"Update 1: Admitted to cheating on her trip. Says only once, evidence suggest at least N > 2. 

Update 2: 3 confirmed in one trip. Digging in now. 

Update 3: Typical ""It was a one time thing"" responses, ""It was your fault"" responses. Confirmed at least 3 dudes during her last trip, likely systemic serial cheater since we've been together. Refuses to admit anything outside this business trip even though she had carbon copy behavior 2 years ago. Refuses to be honest. Claims she wasn't going to meet anyone on her current ""solo"" camping trip, I know otherwise. Keep catching her in lies. Filing papers meow. 

Update 4: It's at least 4 now. 1 on her first trip 2 years ago, hence the STD test then. Mutual friend knew about it, kept it secret. This is days / a week after we got engaged. 

tl;dr SO secretly got tested for STDs the day she returned from a long business trip; is clean, but concealed the appointment and intentionally hid/deleted any evidence of testing. SO has been disinterested in any sexual contact for two weeks since her return. I found out about the test but haven't spoken to her about it. What is the best way to broach the topic? 




Throwaway for reasons. My wife is a great person and we have always gotten along. We have been married for almost two years and we've been together for four and a half years. We are in a monogamous relationship and have both had several partners prior to our relationship. Every year, my wife goes on a long business trip (typically about two months). During this time, communication over phone and email can be difficult, contingent upon the technological issues where she works. She really enjoys her work during the business trips and usually comes home feeling fulfilled and excited about life. 



Normally when she comes home, she takes a day or two to rest and overcome the jetlag (28 hour travel time and 21 hour time difference). The following days, we tend spend lots of time together, sex, dates, cuddling, catching up etc. because she's been gone so long. 



This year, she came home as her same excited self after having had a great trip. In fact, she seemed so excited, that she wanted to work on some projects, but would need to go get some material from the store. About three hours after picking her up from the airport, she says she wants to go shopping for her craft project and that she will likely spend several hours out shopping. She really emphasizes how much time she'll need to go shopping--many hours. I think this is a little weird considering that she just came back from a 28 hour flight, hasn't slept, and she's usually not the type to spend more than an hour or two shopping, but w/e it's fine. About 5 hours later, she comes home with a single bag of craft material, I register this as strange, but don't really think about it. I chalk it up to taking a lot of time to pick out her materials, carefully selecting them instead of bulk buying.



Over the next few days, she didn't really go through the jetlag phase and stayed distant. I thought that was weird but ended up giving her space and just focused on school. About two weeks post-return, we still haven't had sex, despite my advances and lightly prodding the issue (getting a ""I'm just feeling off and don't feel like it""). I find that strange, since she is usually a 3-4 times a week kind of person and we've been exploring some new kinks prior to her trip—which we had talked about kindling once she returned. The first few times that she doesn't reciprocate sexy-time advances, I don't think anything of it. We've always had a very open ""No"" policy and are attentive to one another needs i.e.—time, tired, not feeling it, need it now. After two weeks, the combination of her distance and no sex feels really ""off."" 



Over the weekend she went met up with her girlfriends for a day out. During that time, I snooped on her computer. If that bothers you, stop reading now. We have always been extremely open with our phones and social media—we both know our phone passwords/computer passwords/she knows my Facebook etc. While she was out with her friend, I looked on her computer. She left her work and personal email, Reddit, and Facebook open/logged in. So I looked. Nothing out of the ordinary. I looked in the recycle bin and found that she had taken some self-nudes with her phone, sent them to her email, downloaded, then deleted them (hence the recycling bin). I thought that was odd, normally we would send nudes to each other, not put them on our computers—maybe she really liked them (she did look hot) and decided to keep them. This has my gears turning, because she has been really disinterested in sex since returning, but is taking selfies in the nude wearing lingerie. I looked at the metadata on the picture, confirmed it was taken recently and that it was downloaded from Gmail. 



I went and looked at her Gmail. Nothing terribly odd here—but anything before 3 days after returning home had been deleted from her inbox, then deleted from the trash folder / not-archived e.g. if she came home on the 1st, everything before the 4th was deleted. However, in her trash bin, was a confirmation of appointment for a health clinic in an adjacent city. It had a link with a user ID to login into the patient portal if you needed to change your appointment. I logged in with the ID and her common passwords (which I already knew from us sharing). The portal is mostly empty, but showed that she had scheduled and kept an appointment the same afternoon that she got home from her trip. The portal allows you to request records from visits, so I did. They were delivered to the portal about 30 minutes later. She had gone in for STD testing 5 hours after coming home from an 8-week business trip.
 

To summarize:

1. Gets tested for STDs while saying she is going shopping the day she returns from an 8-week business trip.

2. Concealed the fact that she was tested, didn't leave phone number or address at clinic, careful to delete emails pertaining to the clinic, made cover excuse to go out

2. Super distant with me (very engaging towards friends/coworkers) / no sex

3. Says not interested in sex, but dresses up to take nudies/clearly masturbating (found lots of porn open on her computer, vibrator out—not anything odd, we watch porn together and alone, open about masturbation etc) 

4. On a similar business trip, she did almost the exact same thing. Got tested as soon as she got home (7-week trip), refrained from sex for about a week/distant, I found out via similar ways (shared computer, saw email from health clinic about results on portal). Previously, when I asked her about it, she said she had a UTI and went in for a full STD panel. Totally plausible—I let it go. I just feel like there's a pattern here. Also said that STD test was normal for women during checkups—although most clinics say that you must ask for the tests/reasonable suspicion. 

6. No real reason to suspect cheating, but god damn, this feels weird. All the elements of possibility are there I suppose.



Possible explanations:

1. She had another health problem that seemed to resolve itself, maybe she wanted more followup and didn't want to belabor me with the details—although the other health issue isn't urogenital related. She didn't receive any tests that would aim to diagnose the concomitant issue. 

2. Health information could be weird if someone reading over your shoulder sees an email in your personal inbox from a clinic, so you delete it. I'm not sure this explains why her inbox was cleaned / stuff deleted from the Trash.

3. Maybe she feels a little detached from me after being away for so long and needs more time to warm back up?

4. Could have also had another UTI and got STD panel at the request of practitioner? Although, no antibiotics/treatments were administered during the visit / weren't documented

5. Maybe she thought I was cheating and got tested? Although, 8-weeks later seems a little outside of the incubation period. 


The secrecy of the whole thing really bothers me. Any ideas on how to approach this topic with my wife or other possible explanations?

I (F) need advice on how to best deal with a follower of mine (30M) who has autism and continues to spend large amount of money on me.,"Update - I will be doing my best to contact a caretaker or the mom before blocking him as best as I can. Thank you all for the help.  


A few quick notes - I am an artist with a pretty large following on Instagram. I often get fan mail and so, have a POBox publicly available. Being an artist is my full time gig and I often sell art that goes for $200-$300, to give you a range of what I usually make. This may end up being long, but there's quite a few details I want to explain.

About a year ago, I received a message on Instagram from one of my followers (Ill call him Jake) asking me to follow him back on instagram. Jake had a basic, public account where he just posted pictures about a game he liked. I refused but thanked him for following me. I explained that I just don't follow accounts and that I was sorry. He wrote me back about 5 paragraphs worth of text basically begging me to follow him and explaining that he had Aspergers and that it would mean the world to him if I followed him back. I'll be honest, it tugged at my heartstrings. I thought it over for a bit, and decided it was no big deal to follow him, so I did. He was extremely happy - I got about 3 or 4 more paragraphs from him.

He wrote that he had multiple instagram accounts - about 20 - and that he was going to like all of my posts and follow me with each one over the course of a week as thanks. I told him he did not have to do that, but he did it anyway. Over the next few months he would write me a few paragraphs asking about random things and I would write back. The conversations were friendly enough.

During this time, I set up a second Instagram page where I would be selling my artwork and various other things. Jake found it, followed it, and messaged me that he was interested in buying some of my artwork. I sell my stuff through auctions, so he wanted to know how to participate. I explained it to him.  A few days later I hosted a new auction. Usually the pieces start below $100 and are gradually bidded up over time. Jake immediately bidded $400 on the piece. I messaged him explaining that he should probably start closer to the current bid, but he refused and said that he really wanted the work. I sold it to him, he paid, I didn't really think much of it.

Over the next few months, this would continue to happen. I would post something for sale, he would immediately buy it. During this time, he got my email address from an order he placed with me. He began sending me emails from 10 separate email accounts - always the same email, just copied and pasted - that were up to two full pages long of size 10 font text. They were always very random - he would ask me what my favorite food was, he would ask if I know any of my followers in real life, if I did, what were their names and email addresses, what was my birthday, did I like certain music... it would go on and on. In the beginning, I would answer non-revealing questions just to be nice. But I couldn't keep replying to 2 page long emails every day. I eventually just quit responding.

Jake continued to buy things from me for prices way above what I wanted for the items. When I quit responding to his emails, he began copying and pasting them into Instagram messenger and sending them to me. When I quit replying there, he started printing the emails out (sometimes up to 5 pages of text) and mailing them to my POBox with express next-day shipping - usually costing about $40 per package according to the labels on them. He also started mailing me gifts he bought for me as well.

This got me really freaked out, and I sent him a very short and concise email. I told him I do not want him emailing and messaging me so much. I have a business to run, and I cannot keep replying to all of his questions. I also stated that while I appreciated the gifts, I felt uncomfortable with how much money he was spending on me, and to please spend it on himself in some way instead and that would make me much happier.

For a few weeks, this worked. Everything quit. He quit buying things too. I figured he moved on.

My ""birthday"" came - I had given him a fake date early on when he had asked me about it. I got 20+ emails all with a dozen or so paragraphs wishing me happy birthday and, once again, a ton of questions that had nothing to do with it. Begging me to follow his youtube account. Asking about places Id been or wanted to go, favorite drinks, just on and on. He also told me about his caretaker taking him to see a movie, his own age, and a bit about his family in this email (non of which I had asked about). He doesn't work. His father died early after he was born, and his mom was very elderly (I think he said 80+). His mom gives him allowance every month and that sometimes he asks her for more money to buy my artwork. When he would buy my stuff, he paid with a paypal account that was under a woman's name, so I guess that's where the money was coming from.

I again, reiterated that I wish he wouldn't spend so much money on me.

Now, present time, he is still spending up to $1000 on my art every month. He also just mailed me a package of ""his favorite snack"" that he bought for me to try. Again, express shipped.

And now I'm here to ask for advice. I've tried treating him like I would a normal person. I've tried to completely ignore him but I have to talk to him when he buys my stuff. I've tried being nice to him, asking him to stop multiple times. I can't block him because he has multiple accounts and has bragged to me before about how he has even more than I know about. I can't hide my POBox address from him, plus he already has it. I'm just at a loss at this point. My mom told me to tell him I was married and that my husband was starting to get jealous, but he has never acted like he was romantically attracted to me at all, his questions are always very tame, and that wouldn't stop him anyway, I don't think. At this point, I only communicate with him when he buys my stuff, but I still feel extremely guilty about him spending so much of what I assume is his mom's money.

Sorry for the long story. Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: (35M) CrashBandiChild claims I was merely setting a fire for attention.,"You guys? I can't.

First of all, I want to say a huge THANK YOU for the responses I received on my last post. It is below for your reference in case you missed the comedic shitshow that is this recent life experience.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cgw77v/my\_32f\_boyfriend\_35m\_got\_in\_an\_accident\_in\_my\_car/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgw77v/my_32f_boyfriend_35m_got_in_an_accident_in_my_car/)

I was straight up blown away by the support, suggestion, and compassion I was shown by total strangers. Some of y'all had me DYING laughing in one of the shittiest times of my adult life. A VERY kind gentleman from Scotland even offered to pay for my daughter to and I to go out to a nice meal together because he noticed in the thread that I mentioned I was a single mom. Reddit rules.

So. I know most of you said ghost him, but I just couldn't. While undoubtedly that is what he deserved, I needed to hear from his perspective why he thought any of this was okay before I could close the door. And honestly, I am glad I did because it solidified for me that this relationship was an excellent learning experience, that I had done my learning, and it was time to move the fuck on. 

His avoidance of the situation was explained by his thinking it wasn't that big of a deal. He said that he didn't understand why this lady was making such a big fuss about her bumper, and that I was unreasonably upset about it and he didn't want to talk about it until I had ""calmed down"". Oh. Hell. No. I kept it together until I got his side of the story. According to him, they were both backing out of their parking spots and smacked into each other. He was all the way out of his spot, she was halfway out of hers when BANG. I literally DIALED THE PHONE AND SAT WITH HIM while he called the insurance rep and gave his statement. He was found at fault due to his being all the way out of the spot. I am not 100% sure what this means for me, my policy, or my pocket yet.

As far as the relationship - done. When he came over to talk I had all his things packed up. I tried to explain how hurt and disappointed I was about his actions, and told that I could no longer trust him because of how terribly he handled this situation. He said, I shit you not, ""Oh, please. You just set a fire and expected me to come to your rescue and put it out and when I didn't you threw a fit. I'm sorry. I just didn't have the energy to put out your fire."" THIS IS YOUR GOD DAMN FIRE SET BY YOUR SHITTY ACTIONS AND FUELED BY YOUR AVOIDANCE. I burst into tears, handed him his bag, and said I needed him to leave. Now.  I told him anything of mine left at his place he can throw away, or leave there until his next victim or mother comes and cleans it for him.

Speaking of his mother, I did listen to you and craft a very detailed email to her with him CC'd. I explained what happened, and then asked her for his Driver's License number and policy name and ID number just in case its needed. Her response was, ""I am very sorry that you are having to deal with all this, but I don't see how this is our problem if it was your car"". I feel like this whole family are a bunch of lizard people sent to Earth to make me question my reality.

Anyway. Single at 32 again. Woot. I am **sad as fuck**, but trying to focus on the plus side as someone said ""cutting a bunch of deadass weight"". Thanks again for all the love and laughs.

Oh - and yes - once it is determined how much this is going to affect my rates and my pocket, I will be taking his cartoon quoting ass to small claims court. I have already spoken to my attorney about it.

Much Love,

Pixie

I (26/F) just broke up with my (29/M) boyfriend of 5 years due to him not wanting to get married and have a family,"I'm a huge family person. I feel like I was put on this Earth to be a mother. My ex is not close with his family at all and doesn't have a paternal bone in his body. I have tried multiple times to talk about our future together and our personal goals as a couple, and I have gotten absolutely nowhere. So three days ago, I packed up my shit and moved into my mom's house. I just feel like we aren't getting any younger and he just has no interest in what I want. It sounds cold but it makes sense to me. I know deep down we had no future. I've been feeling this way for a while and I just think it's useless to put effort into something that isn't going to work in the long haul. Was I wrong to do this?

Update: I really didn't think this post was gonna get as much love as it did lol. Thank you, Reddit users, for all of your kind words and support. It really means a lot. I still love him as a person and he will always be a huge part of my life, but I need to focus on my wants and needs too. We will both find our happy endings.",relationship_advice

Okay guys. 

I listened. Yesterday I called the non emergency police number and asked for someone to come to my house. I talked to a cop for about an hour and explained the entire situation. I showed him pictures of blackmail texts. I showed him pictures of my face after getting the shit kicked out of me. I showed him everything I needed to.

He said he had to go talk to them as well so he did and I filled out a report. 

He arrested them. I was so fucking happy. Then 2 hours later he came and arrested me as well. 

Our charges-

Ex: Possesion of marijuana not over 20 grams, assault, extortion, petty theft, resisting arrest without violence, possession of controlled substance without prescription W intent to sell (I don't know what that one is. I guess they found drugs on them when they arrested them) and probation violation (she previously got arrested on drug charges but I didn't even know she was on probation) 


Ex's man: assault, resisting arrest without violence, possesion of controlled substance without prescription, 


Me: assault

I'm being told by numerous people that I should get out of this okay but I'm still really scared. As far as I know they're both still in jail but my dad bailed me out as soon as he could. It's not a fun experience and I hope I don't do any time. 

She is literally about to have the baby anytime so I do feel bad that she just got arrested but I'm being told that both of them especially her are probably gonna do some time but I'm honestly just thinking about dropping charges.

On the other hand it'd be cool to have full custody over my child. I'm so torn.


I'm also getting texts from a bunch of her family members who don't know the situation at all about how much of a piece of shit I am for getting her arrested and how I should've just moved on when she dumped my sorry ass etc.



UPDATE: She just got bailed out and said she wants to get back together and that I should drop my charges against her and that she'd fight the rest. Considering she's still engaged on Facebook I'm leaning more towards this being a trick on her part.",relationship_advice

Sorry for the delay, it's been crazy. 

So, briefly, I didn't update because I was really feeling shitty. I took nighttime cold medicine really early and passed-out and wound-up taking Friday off. I binged Chernobyl and slept/recuperated. I didn't respond to Danielle and my wife sort of left me alone to recover as I felt like shit. She took care of me but also didn't bring up the topic until I wasn't on my back. 

Once I started feeling better and could breathe through my nose again, I tried to calmly approach this. On the table was a pregnancy test (we've been trying for a while) with a little bow on it. I had previously noticed that she was ""late"" but my wife and I had a few very late periods and no pregnancy, so I wasn't sure what's what - I'm pretty sure I mentioned trying for a kid in my OP. So, that adds a layer of complexity to all this. 

To answer some of your questions:

1. In general, things were great between my wife and I and have been for years. The real problem we had was in those first few months which involved a number of issues about being in a new relationship. We rarely fought, things were very happy; we had a great sex life, we openly talked about everything. I would never imagine that I'd be sent something like this. 
2. Exclusive? We had never talked about it. It was never stated one way or the other. I assumed we were, but I guess not. 
3. Her ex. He's a writer, let me rephrase a ""writer"" who has never written. Mike and I have met a few times, a few times by accident and once because he was invited to a party we went to. He's not really that interesting/threatening and my wife seems totally nonplussed with him. The last time we saw him was in a bookstore and she didn't at all seem interested. She later said she was glad it didn't workout and was happy without him in her life. 
4. Danielle. Danielle and Katie have been friends for two decades, but the last couple of years things became contentious. Katie and I got together and Danielle's marriage fizzled out. Danielle can be a nice person, but is difficult and I think she's jealous that our relationship was, until that point, very successful. She and I didn't really spend that much time together and she retreated from my wife's life when she found out we were trying for a kid. In the wake of all this, their friendship is ruined, that's for sure, 

I was feeling crummy and watched back-to-back episodes of TV and did nothing all day Friday. I literally did nothing beyond getting up to take some medicine/eat and pee. That's it. I didn't broach the subject or even think about it. When my wife got home, I felt better and could think a bit more cogently. She does errands after work which is when she dropped the test on the table and scrammed. A few people commented that we should wait to have kids... well, that's not going to happen. She got back and we ""talked"". 

The story is, and I have no reason to doubt her: She and Mike were dating. She was studying/working and he was writing. He asked to go on a writing retreat with his ex-girlfriend to a cabin somewhere that they could focus on their work. She said no, that it wasn't a good idea for him to be alone with his ex and he went anyway. That translated into his leaving for some prolonged road trip with his ex. They kept in contact but she and I started dating.  We had been together 3 or 4 weeks when he returned and they didn't see each other at first. My wife, like I said, is different from me: I'm a lot more traditional, a lot more formal and am very, very career oriented. When we hit a rough patch, there was more than an insubstantial chance I was going to have to move away and she was going to have to decide to move with me (after 2 1/2 - 3 months of seeing each other) or break up and move on. I had applied for a program and it looked like the local program was going to reject me, but surprisingly, a better, far more well-known university was going to accept me. When things ""went down"" between them, I had been formally rejected and she had to make a decision. I was too focused on admission to even notice/care. They met up at a party and nothing happened, they just talked and had drinks. The second time they met, that's when ""the deed"" happened. She apparently regretted it immediately and the final time was to tell him goodbye and that she was moving. They had a few drinks, ""fooled around"" and then she left. She said she knew it was a mistake, she knew they had no future and nothing in common anymore. Right around the time that they fooled around she and I had a mega fight about moving. It was a lot for someone to deal with (I know) but in the end, she said she wanted to go, but was scared I was going to get to New City in my new program and dump her for a classmate, stranding her. I told her no, and offered her whatever assurances I could. It worked and we did live happily ever after. 

I would never have assumed she had cheated. I mean, putting it down, we were in a weird spot and I fully understand why it was a rough time, but the cheating was really not something I could abide by. The whole ""exclusive"" thing came from us moving - I didn't put 2+2 together at the time - I figured (then) that she wanted assurances that moving with me wasn't a huge mistake, not that she had recently bonked her ex who has frequent, and unprotected, sex with many randoms - but again, it also makes sense. From then till about a month after we moved we didn't have sex. Not once. I asked if she had been tested and she just casually remarked ""of course."" 

I was still feeling crappy and didn't know what to do, so I just kind of went back to bed. In reality, for years she's never strayed or been anything but open. She has access to my phone and I can access hers. She doesn't go out with unexplained absences and is more of a homebody. She isn't flirtatious with people or cause drama, so I just sort of stopped caring. I took the weekend to get over this cold and we did some baby shopping online and planned for a follow-up with her doctor. After that, we just didn't talk about it again. Very anti-climactic. 

I did bring up the subject of Danielle and pretty directly told her I was done with her. She asked if she thought it would be wise to try and talk to her and I said no. We wrote her an email (using my account) and sent her a response basically telling her that we were done with her and not to bother us again. She responded by saying ""it was a joke!"" and asked that we understand that she was being funny. I found the block function on gmail and added her. My wife noticed that she removed her from FB/Insta and I guess that's that. 

Not really a thrilling or interesting update and a few people will be angry that I didn't take a stronger tone/reaction, but I did what I felt was best under the circumstances. Hopefully this is behind us and I can just move on and enjoy bringing a new life into the world.",relationship_advice
"Asked spouse to say one nice thing about me, reply was less than ideal.","My husband is constantly angry and it's exhausting.

Partner lied for two years about saving for a house,"My partner(F 33) and I (M 34) have been together for about 7 years total, with a short 6 month break after a couple of years.

A few years ago we started talking about kids and houses.

We both said we started saving roughly 2 years ago and have been talking for about a year about where we would like to live. She had been sending me pictures and adverts of houses, just outside of our local city where the prices are low but we would be  isolated , I had been pushing for somewhere about 20/30% more expensive  that would keep us close to both our parents, I have tried to explain to her that even if she wants to come out of work to raise children that my wage is more than enough to do that, pay the mortgage and have a decent lifestyle. Right now my wage is about 33% above the average for our country, on top of which there are other allowances available to families too, so we would have been fine.

Anyways, we were both saving into our own, seperate, bank accounts and from time to time I would ask her how much was in there and she would tell me $xyz which was always pretty in keeping with the expected total, except for one point last year when she was about 2Gs short and I called her on it, she said she had needed a bit of cash for things and hadn't been saving as regularly as we agreed. She said from now on she would put regular amount into the account at regular intervals.


Ok, sorry this is so long, this year I talked to her about going to see a mortgage broker about 3 months before I actually organised the meeting. This was to make sure we had the maximum deposit for the maximum mortgage we were going to get.
She agreed.
I set up the meeting.
She came.
The broker asked about our savings.
She replied ""Circa $ABC""
Which was the expected amount.
We took the forms home and filled them in together, after a little of her putting it off.
She started sending me more houses to view online.
We actually went to view one together at her suggestion and I went to another that she couldn't make it to.

Now the meat of the story.
The broker keeps asking me for her bank account statements which she hasn't provided.
So I keep asking her for them, and at first she said she ordered them.
Then she said she'd reordered them.
Then she said every time you ring you are left on the phone for an hour.
Then she said she had a fight with the manager and the manager was ""personally posting them"".
She said she couldn't print them herself because it is a special savings account which doesn't have online access. (Partly true, hih interest account you must give like 28 days notice to withdraw money)
Then she said the bank has no branches in our city (stupid me, I never verified this, but also half true they only do these weird walk in offices and there are only like 4 of them in our city)
I give her the benefit of the doubt, but at this stage I've told the story one too many times and it clicks in my head, it's complete bullshit.

So I go home and start checking thru the other document that she did provide, her current account statement is there, and so I take a quick read of it and I can see she is saving about 75% of her wages into 2 different accounts the minute she gets paid and then withdrawing that and then some as the month goes on. Leaving her spending between 25-50% more than she makes in a month.

I finally decided to check out this literal worst bank in the world, called them, got thru in 2 mins flat.
The account she was saving into, luckily for investigative purposes is actually a joint account that I never used. The guy advises me to go to a fake branch and get a statement.

Instead of the 2 years worth of saving she is supposed to have done the account is empty save 200 dollars.

I work 12 hour shifts, sometimes many days in a row, weekends, overtime, you name it to make sure that we can save and still have nice things.
I have avoided spending money on myself so that we could afford to do things together.
I feel like the whole time she has been laughing at me.

The thing is, just as I found out that all this has happened, we also found out that we are having a baby, paternity test is obvious choice here.

So I feel trapped now. 
I feel lied to and betrayed and I am halfway between, walking away and jumping off a roof(just a though, for now)
I feel like this person has repeatedly had chances to come forward and didn't bother and yet keeps talking about getting married and having a family.


I need advice, has anyone ever heard anything mental like this before?
Am I a god damned moron for trusting the girl I've been dating for 7 years?

P.s.
I do definitly want to speak to her parents first, in case the child is mine and she runs off telling lies about how it hot her or something so at least they can back me up.

Help!

TLDR: Girlfriend told me for 2 years she has been saving for a house but after going thru the motions, filling out all the paperwork and viewing houses, her bank account turned out to empty because she has spent it instead of saving.

Edit: Thank you all for your thoughts, it has been really calming for me. Yesterday I was so panicked that I couldn't think straight and today I am able to breathe again. That is all thanks to this thread.

I have decided that I am going to speak to her mother (to protect myself) in the next few days and then confront my gf the next day and suggest that I take over all of our finances and control our spending. I don't think I would be ok walking away from my long relationship with someone I love or my child but I also cannot take any chances now that something similar will happen in the future.

It will probably be Saturday before all of this is done and I have an update for everybody who helped.
I will start a new thread with the same name then.

Thank you all again so much, the shared, often upsetting, experiences and huge amount of differing opinions have been so insightful and have helped me keep my sanity.

Getting divorced because I don't want children," (Using a throwaway as my wife knows my reddit username)

We  got married 8 years ago to a girl I had known since we were kids. We  almost didn't get married because I didn't want children and she did,  but everyone talked me around and said I'll feel different when I'm  older etc... so we went ahead.

Then we  tried, in vain, to have children for 3 years, I dreaded the thought but  did it for her. Doctors here couldn't understand it, nothing wrong with  either of us and lifestyles were also ideal.

2  years ago I went through a major midlife crisis and came out of it  stronger, and more assertive about my own needs (I'm your serial people  pleaser type). At which point I put my foot down and said that I don't  want to have children for many many reasons, she can't come around to  the idea (nor would I want her to against her own will).

Now,  I'm 34, she's 31 and it looks like we're going to have to split over  it. Initially I thought it's a shame because we're so good together but  for this one difference in opinion. But when I thought about it more I  realized it's not about just this one thing, it's rooted in a difference  of who we are in our core and our aspirations more widely - in terms of  bigger picture and what we want our contribution to the world to be.  But it's heart-breaking all the same, leaves me with a knot in my  stomach, but one that's smaller than the knot of being a father.

Boyfriend didn't visit me after getting in a car accident,"I got hit by an 18 wheeler on the highway, and I made it out okay with bruises and a concussion. I told my boyfriend (18M) that night, and maybe I'm just expecting the same type of care I would give. He lives 15 minutes away, and he didn't visit me when I got home because he thought his mom would say no.. he owns his own car. I asked him to come over in the morning because my family left town and he showed up at 12:40p.m. 
I feel disregarded and almost neglected. 
I asked him if he could take me to the hospital and he said he didn't know if he was busy. I also asked him to drive me to pick up my rats because my car was completely demolished and he asked me for gas money. Is it normal to expect that?
I feel like I'm being high maintenance here. Help?",relationship_advice
My wife is a totally different person now.,"I have been married over 10 years and everything was wonderful until earlier this year.  My wife is kinda going through a mid life crisis in my opinion and she keeps saying to herself that she is 25 years old but she just turned 40.  I wanted her to chase her goals earlier this year but she is constantly on her phone trying to go get as many ""likes"" as possible on her photos. She started putting on makeup and she takes selfies every 10 mins.  She now wants an open relationship and It's difficult for me to handle. I honestly have been faithful to her our entire marriage and I always loved her...always will, I don't go out drinking with the buddies or anything like that. I just work, come home, and spend time with her...I'm exhausted.  I saw the signs:

\#1. I was able to look at her phone whenever I wanted now she guards it like a hawk.

\#2. She asks about an open relationship because I'm not giving her enough sex.

\#3. She told me one time that she is going to live longer than me.

\#4. She wants me to work out more, which wasn't a problem before.

\#5. We have problems communicating which wasn't a problem before. We do yell once in a while, (Not often).

\#6. We use to fight once a month  but now our fights are more frequent, We don't do the physical fighting stuff.

\#7. I've cried more this year then I ever have in my life because I really care about her.

\#8. Guys call the house asking for her this year, which never happened before.

\#9. She doesn't help me with any of the chores around the house, I have to do them on my own.

\#10. She feels like I'm her room mate but I do a lot for her and when I tell her she gets mad.

I know there are two sides to every story and I wish she could say hers so you can get the full picture.

I think our marriage is now dying and I would like to start repairing it or prepare for the inevitable. I'm really hurt right now  and I would like some advice if you can pls.

Thank you!

"My (23F) husband (36M) will only eat ""kiddie food"" and it's ruining our relationship.","[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bobslu/update_my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie/) 

My husband will only eat chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, and spaghetti-o's. That's it. When we go over to friends' places he'll actually bring some spaghetti-o's to heat up in their microwave instead of eating anything else, even if our friends cooked a wonderful meal.

If we go out somewhere to eat he will only order chicken nuggets off the kid's menu. If they don't have them, he just won't eat.

If I try to cook literally ANYTHING except one of his three food groups, he will claim he's allergic to some random ingredient instead of just outright saying he doesn't want to eat it. He'll then try to guilt me for ""forgetting"" his allergy. Spoiler: We've been to the doctor and he's not allergic to anything.

My husband just turned 36 this month. His food habits were sort of cute/acceptable when we were both in college and eating like trash, but now I'm genuinely worried about his health. I also find myself avoiding any sort of dining situations with our friends, which is so much harder than it sounds.

I've tried talking to him about his eating habits and just he brushes me off. Since I don't cook his meals (the only victory I've had in this situation) he doesn't think I have the right to ""dictate"" what he can and can't eat.

I'm not his mother. I'm his wife. But I just want my husband, the man I love, to be healthy.

What do I do?

Edit: We met when I was 19, in my sophomore year of college. We got married after graduation and moved in together shortly after. I didn't realize how strict his ""diet"" was until after we were married.

**Edit**: Thank you for your comments and suggestions! There are so many wonderful comment that it'd take me all day to make it through, so I'll try to address them here and then post an update tonight. 

It does sound like ARFID, and I agree that we need counseling. There's a good counseling center nearby that I found last night that offers couple's therapy, I want to try them first. I'm going to bring it up to him tonight and really try to explain how much this issue bothers me, and how at the very least we should discuss this with a counselor to find a place where we're both happy.",relationship_advice
Girlfriend [23F] of six years just revealed to me [22M] that she has faked around 99% of her orgasms throughout the entirety of our relationship.,"She said she did it because she didn't want to kill the mood, and that it is actually really difficult to make her climax. I was floored. I thought we had amazing sex and that she was satisfied, but all of her cues in bed have been theatre. She has emotional problems, anxiety, and is a self-described people pleaser, to the point where she feels as though she acts as a doormat in all her interactions with others. 

I am devastated to hear this. I feel like the thousands of lies have seriously undermined our trust, and i have lost all of my sexual confidence.  Sex now seems so daunting, because I apparently don't know the first thing about how to pleasure her. How can we recover from this? How can I not feel inadequate forever? We are still in love, and she told me she did it not to upset me, and kept the lie going for six whole years. Fml.",relationship_advice
My [29M] girlfriend [30F] had her guy friend stay over at our place while I was out of town. Should I be worried?,"Context here: we've been dating two years now, living together for about 6 months. I was away this weekend, and Saturday night my girlfriend went out with her guy friend, got pretty drunk, and stayed out late.  She has been friends with him for several years and has known him longer than we've been dating, but never seemed like anything.

I didn't know anything she was doing that Saturday night until I came home Sunday afternoon. My text to her the previous night was unanswered to until 8:30AM.  When I got home, she was clearly hungover and I asked about her night.

It was then that she said she went out with her friend and that he crashed on our couch because he lives far away (google maps has it at about 30 mins drive).  I also saw she was in the process of washing the bedsheets we sleep with.

I thought to myself it was a little weird, but shrugged it off because I trust her and she offered up that detail.

My gut only really started to feel something was off when later that night, when we were intimate in bed, she makes a comment about the way I kiss.  We've been together for two years, mind you, so why she's only now making a remark about this made me feel like there was some other context behind it.  If she made this comment on a normal day, I wouldn't think twice. But because of when it occurred, it set me on edge.

So am I being paranoid?",relationship_advice
I (23) just found out my parents paid for my sister's (21) college but made me take out $40k in student loans and now we're not speaking,"To start off, I know my parents love me and are proud of me. Growing up, though, they always gave more to my sister because she is not as capable or as smart as I am (I know that sounds mean, but it's objectively true). Whether that was money, replacing toys or electronics she lost/ broke, my parents would provide more to her because she wasn't responsible. Even when I was in high school they would make me pay for my own school trips because they said they ""couldn't afford it"", but would pay for anything my sister wanted to do.

Last week I found out they replaced her MacBook for the 4th time (she got drunk and spilled beer on it). This lead me to a line of questioning to my parents since they made me buy my own computer in college and didn't contribute. It finally came to a head when I asked if they paid more for her college than they did mine and it became clear that they did. 

I went to a top college in the US with a <10% acceptance rate. My entire life I have been passionate about working in politics, so I went to the best school in the US for it. I had no legacy, have struggled with mental health my whole life, and cried tears of joy when I finally got it since I truly earned my spot there. But because of how expensive the college was, I had to take out a significant amount of loans, work many jobs in college to support myself, and ultimately got a job in an unrelated field to pay off my debt. My parents said they would only contribute $x for my college because that was all they could afford and that my sister and I would get the same amount for school (we qualified for some financial aid, but it wasn't enough for me to avoid taking out loans). My sister went to a bottom-tier school (to put it in perspective it has an 85% acceptance rate), has repeated said she doesn't care about college, only wants an ""easy life"", and her dream is to find someone rich to marry.

I'm realizing that I essentially subsidized her education and have had to sacrifice my passion in life in order for that to happen. My parents have stopped responding to me when I ask about it. Even though my college was more expensive than hers, they paid more for hers (not to mention financially supporting her every summer whereas I got jobs in finance where I worked 80 hrs/ week to put that money towards my education) despite how little she cares about school.

I understand that because she doesn't care much about her life and isn't as capable as I am, my parents have had to financially support her more. What I cannot come to terms with is how much they lied to me about it and how they have stopped communicating with me.

What can I do to move forward? I feel a lot of resentment for them because they know how hard I've worked and what I have had to sacrifice to be where I am in life, but were unwilling to help me whereas they helped my sister. I feel like I gave up on my dreams to pursue a more financially-realistic career and my heart is broken.

TLDR: My parents paid for my sister's college and not mine and lied to me about it for years. I don't know how to move on from this and continue having a relationship with them.",relationship_advice
"My girlfriend who I am living with told me I'm not good enough for her...... ""but""","So this kind of discussion has been popping up here and there for the entire year that we have been together.  We have a lot of fun together and most of the time it is great in every way. I'm 31 and she 29, not married.

We were having a general (or so I thought) conversation about relationships and what people in mixed-culture couples want and ask from each other, as well as differences between men and women.  Then she told me this:

&#x200B;

*""You are not good enough for me, but you are the best I could find. But I love you""*

&#x200B;

A little more background: I'm north european and she is from central asia which means we have some cultural differences to overcome. We have been living together in my apartement for most of the time that we have been together. I work and make decent money in engineering and she makes twice of what I make.

&#x200B;

She wants me to get a better job so that I make as much as she does, or almost, or more. What bothers me is that she wants me to make money so that I will be able to provide her with money to pursue her hobby in fashion and buy her dresses and the jewelry she want, when she for some reason gets unemployed. She believe it is natural for the man to pay for everything in the relationship (including house, food, car, expenses etc) while she spends her money on herself, and then contributes whatever she feels like, even when working and making twice what I make. For me the natural thing is to share expenses, and contribute more or less equally since we are a couple and live together. This is very hard for her to understand. From my point of view she seems entitled to special treatment.

There are more issues...  she told me that she told her ex that he had a small dick, she called her other ex worthless when he was depressed. So I basically worry she will treat me the same way if I won't be her little dog. That's the feeling I get.

What is going on here? I'm just trying to understand...or rather figure out if it is worth staying. Thanks people.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  Thanks for all the comments. First reddit post so this is very cool.This post was all about the bad, crucial stuff and the stuff she would start a silent and stubborn tantrum about.The good things in this relationship is that she seems very caring and attached to me, tries to understand all these differences in culture. She is very honest and we have a great time on a day-to-day basis, laughing, fooling around, sex and more.

I just can't get my head around her expectations. Is it just ""cultural differences"" that I can accommodate to some degree or is it her deep character...One of you said this about her thinking:   "" your money is 'our' money and her money is her money"" ( [FirstFarmOnTheLeft](https://www.reddit.com/user/FirstFarmOnTheLeft) ) ....which is spot on. That mindset bothers me a lot.

CLARIFICATION: She IS paying half the expenses for the apartement, but reluctantly.",relationship_advice
"I think I crossed the line in my wife and I's ""open marriage"".... But I'm struggling to empathize with my wife","My wife basically forced me into a temporary open marriage a 5-6 months ago. We recently both turned 50 and have been together since college. She, I guess as part of a mid-life crisis, was lamenting the fact she had never been with any other men. So proposed a temporary open marriage so that we could both experiment, and then ""close"" our marriage for good.

Obviously very few men will take the news ""I want to sleep with other men"" well, and so I refused at first. But she made it clear that if I didn't agree we'd have to separate, and so I went along with it. After all, it's going to go both ways, so what the hell. Maybe I'll enjoy it? Besides, it was only going to be a temporary arrangement.

So she starts matching with guys on tinder, going out to bars, etc. I don't know how successful she was as we had a rule of keeping it out of the house, and quite frankly I don't want to know. I ended up matching with lots of younger girls who are into older guys. They were very attractive, but the sex was boring and not enjoyable. I mean all of it was basically them just laying there and me doing all the work. Not nice.

Anyway at this point I figure I should just see some escorts since the experience  is probably going to be more enjoyable. So I ask my wife if it's okay for me to see some escorts instead. She agrees provided: (a) I always use protection (duh) and (b) I keep my spending to a minimum.

Now to cut a long story short, I ended up becoming a regular client to this one girl. She's a college student working to pay her student fees/living costs. We kick it off and her ""fees"" become less and less as time goes on until we're actually going on dates and stuff and no money is involved anymore. It wasn't really a single moment, overtime I just stopped being a client and started being something else to this girl.

Wife finds out after reading my phone and is accusing me of having an emotional affair with this girl. This girl in turn finds out that my wife knows, and is telling me to go steady with her (saying she'll quit sex work for me). I know I should choose my wife, but honestly, I find myself looking thinking:

1. Our kids are all grown up so they're no longer a consideration in staying together

2. I'm not sure if I can still love my wife the same way after she coerced me into an open relationship so she can sleep around.

3. Despite the age difference, I get along with this girl so much more... Her body/youth is obviously a plus too.

I just found out I am the do-over child. I am insanely mad at my parents and I want to establish a better relationship with my brother. Urgent help please!,"Let me start of by saying that I am non us. In fact ESL. So excuse any mistakes.

I am 15 years old and I thought I had an okay family life.
My big brother who is 32 doesn't speak much with us and I just simply always bought in that he was just sorta ungrateful with my parents.

My parents love me. It's borderline adoration. I am the kid that learned how to play the piano and violin by 10 years old. I have had the best grades of my school for years, I go to all the nerdy stuff like debating competitions etc. That being said I don't really have many friends and so due to academics my social life was always extremely limited. But I took it because I ""am ambitious"" and ""I want to make it big"".

With my brother is like the complete opposite. He is not a fuck up. He just simply is different. He came out as gay when he was 14, he didn't go to university and when he was 15 he got in with the wrong crowd and got shipped away to grandma's. Then they had me.

I know my brother but we aren't close. He is very nice to me. He has bought me cute dresses and makes an effort to make it to my big days but we don't really connect.

Last night I was out with one of my only friends and their aunt showed up. She knew my brother from high-school. She was a little drunk and she all in all is just a mean lady and told me that I was a do over baby. I got mad and left. Because that's ridiculous right??

It didn't stop bugging me so I stole my mom's diary box. I know snooping is bad and I would never do that in any other circumstance. But I was mad and scared. I went trough the books until I found the one from my birth year. But basically she wrote that ""hopefully this one turns out good"" and that ""she doesn't want to be reminded of the failed one"". She literally wrote the failed one.

I have taken that diary and have read it over and over again. I don't think she misses the book as they were in a box in the cellar.

Now I am completely distressed. For one I am not a baby that was wanted out of love but out of shame of another one. Second my brother was over written instead of my parents giving him the help he needs and third HOW THE FUCK CAN THEY USE HUMANS AS SOME SORT OF OBJECTS??????????

I feel like they never loved me as their daughter. They loved the shiny trophies and all the good things I brought home. I am just so fucking hurt. Specially for my brother. He has made an effort to be in our lifes even tho our parents treated him as a disposable object. Not good enough??? No worries we will print another.

It's disgusting. I feel dirty and I feel bad for being so blind all this fucking time! I mean I have hurt my brother just as much by taking the side of my parents all those years. I don't know what to do. My parents don't know I know. I feel too mad to talk to them. I want just to hug my brother and apologize over and over again. I am sorry this is all gibberish I just don't know what to do.",relationship_advice
My Gf cheated on me with her gay best friend,"[Updated below] This week my (27 m) girlfriend (28) went on a work trip with 3 colleagues, two girls and her best friend - a guy she has known since high school who also happens to be gay. They were only away for one night and each had their own hotel room. While they were away, they had a work conference all day and then went out afterwards for some drinks. My GF had been texting me all night and at around 11 said they were back at their hotel. She seemed like she had had a few and I assumed she went to sleep pretty quickly after getting back, which she confirmed in the morning through a text. She wasn't replying much the next day, but I thought nothing more of it and life went on.

I work from home as a videographer and today I was working on a project. I was rendering a file (which can take hours), but realised I had forgotten something for the project and didn't want to cancel the render half way through, so I opened my GF's computer thinking I would just do it on there. As I opened it, Google chrome was open and one of the tabs was her Facebook. A chat window (from today) was open from the friend (who I know quite well). I thought it might be funny to send him a prank message, but as I went to type I got a glimpse of their last messages. They went something like this 

Him: With a girl? Like 8 years lol. Yeah it was weird in the morning 

Her: I feel so guilty 

Him: Idk. (Me) knows I'm gay so he probably won't think anything happened 

I haven't looked past the chat window that's on the screen, as I don't want to be the kind of boyfriend that goes snooping, but those messages alone are pretty damning.

How should I approach it? Say something to her or read the full conversation? 

Am I over reacting to those messages or is it pretty clear she's cheated? 

Other things to note: We've been together 4 years and we live together. 

—————

[Update] I read the rest of the conversation. She didn't cheat. Her (gay) friend is hooking up with a guy who has the same name as me (let's say it's Mark). When they were all drunk, my GF sent snapchats on her (gay) friends phone to Mark of the friend and one of the other girls in bed, topless, as a joke.

The messages before the ones I originally saw were along the lines of:  

Him: Well Mark* is definitely pissed at me lol
Her: Oh he finally replied? What did he say
Him: ""I don't know why you sent me those pictures the other night.."" 
Her: Did you reply? 
Him: Nah, not yet. Whenever I drink whiskey I do stupid shit. Not sure what to say 
Her: Tell him you wanted to know what it was like to spoon with a girl lol
Him: Lol I had forgotten what spooning was like 
Her: lol did Karen* sleep in your bed? 
Her: How long since you've done it? 
Her: Don't tell him I sent them lol 

After reading the rest of the convo and knowing she didn't cheat I quizzed her a bit about the trip (without mentioning I had read the conversation) and she ended up telling me the story. In the end it was just drunken silliness 

Thanks to everyone for their replies. It's disappointing how many people wanted to attack me for weighing up whether to read the rest of the conversation. While it did help clear things up, I do feel bad for snooping and showing distrust in her.

"My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) were on the brink of breakup. Several months later, were back and better than ever! *encouraging post*","Hey everyone. So... far too often on this sub I see people desperate to fix their relationship. More often than not, people will encourage the OPs to leave their relationships. 

This was my experience as well. I posted here several months ago from my other account and I was encouraged to just give up and move on. I didn't and I thought I'd share my story for those of you who are currently in the situation I was in.

To clarify, there was no abuse, cheating, etc. if that is your situation, please do not use my story to hold on hope. Abuse is NEVER okay. Okay now back to bizz.

Background: 

My Girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 6 years. About a year ago, we moved to a new city. The stress of the upcoming move had slowly began to eat away at our relationship. The months leading up to our move, it was apparent that our relationship was in trouble. Nonetheless, we decided to go forward with our move, hoping it would be a fresh start and a new beginning for us. 

Wow. What a great thought that was. Nothing at all went to plan once we arrived. Yes, we both got jobs and the financial stress disappeared but our relationship was going off the rails. It was as if we both began to blame eachother for everything bad that would happen and we both became very resentful towards eachother. It's as if we were mirrors that would just project and amplify our growing emotional distance and blame back and forth. 

One day, it was too much. She was actually the first to say it. She said that she had been thinking about breaking up. I knew it was true but it still hurt all the same. I felt similar but I wasn't ready to give up yet, although when she said that I was ready to accept it. 

5 years of our lives spent together. 4.5 of which were very happy and loving. My heart ached like I can't explain. Anyway.. this conversation happened after a night out. We had shared a bottle of wine and we're both emotional so we decided that we shouldn't make any final decisions in that state of mind. 

The morning came and we decided to address the situation. We still felt the same. There were tears and right before we were about call it quits I said something along the lines of ""stop! I hate that we are here but I still love you"". She reciprocated but our flicker of hope was almost gone.

I got her an airbnb for 2 weeks. In this time we did not talk, no communication at all. I was worried that this was the dumbest idea I've ever had. The weeks were rough. Very rough. So many thoughts going through my head. 

The two weeks ended and she came home. I had never been so happy to see her. This surprised me, before she left I almost couldn't stand to see her. 

We talked for hours and we had the most honest conversation I think we've ever had. We both talked about the situation, how we felt and why we both felt that way. It became pretty clear that we were neglecting eachother emotionally in different ways. 

Since then, things have gotten better. At first it took a lot of effort to look myself in the face and accept responsibility for my part in it. Every day, I did my best to make her feel loved, thought about, cared for, something that I had stopped doing so much after years of being together. She did the same with the issues that I raised.

Today, we are so healthy and our relationship is almost effortless. I'm honestly happier than we were before when things were good. Probably TMI but even our sex life is through the roof. It's been about 8 month since we almost broke up and each day brings its own challenges but we're now taking our relationship in stride as a team. 

If you are in a rough spot in your relationship, consider taking some time apart. Consider being honest with your partner and with yourself. Own your mistakes and try to improve. 

TL;DR- gf and I almost broke up and we figured out how to make it work. I hope that if you're in that situation, you can too.

Edit: Wow! Thanks for sharing all of your stories. I knew that there were other couples out there that still love eachother but are struggling. 

There are a few trolls implying that she went out and screwed around during our break. To clarify, this is not true. We remained monogamous. We took a break from eachother and not the  relationship. If either of us had used the break to sleep with someone else, we would not have worked out.

My dad destroyed my girlfriend's camera and now I'm worried about our relationship.,"My girlfriend is a YouTube vlogger and it has undeniably been the source of some tension in our relationship, but we've been able to talk things out and make things work. My dad has especially been uptight about her being around with her camera and things really boiled over this past week when me, my girlfriend, and my family went on vacation to our Summer beach house in Lake Tahoe.

The first couple of days were fine. My girlfriend didn't vlog when my dad was around and she was being considerate of how he feels about the camera being on, but she still vlogged an awful lot when it was just me and her and sometimes my mom. But one day while we were all getting ready to go out to eat, I was in the bathroom. I won't go into too much detail, but let's just say that I wasn't having the most smooth bowel movement at the time. I was on the toilet for a while and my girlfriend was urging me to hurry up. It then reached a point where she was silent, save for some stifled giggling. I figured that she was most likely filming and trying to get some audio of me taking a dump, so I started yelling at her to turn the camera off. She claimed that she wasn't filming, but she was laughing while saying it and that confirmed to me that she was filming.

I was honestly really annoyed and disgusted that she wanted to film me taking a shit, so I finished my business, burst out the door, and started yelling at her to give me the camera. She ran away and she must've thought that I was joking because she was laughing the whole time, but I was really pissed off and I wanted to take her camera. I was chasing her around the house and things went really bad when she sharply turned a corner and ran into my dad, spilling his soda all over him in the process. He got pissed off, yelled about the vlogging, and then snatches the camera out of my girlfriend's hands. And what does he do? He goes outside with it and chucks it into the lake. My girlfriend was screaming and digging around in the water to find her camera and then my dad starts yelling about cutting the trip short and going home the next day.

We did end up cutting the trip short and my girlfriend refused to talk to anyone. She did end up finding her camera, but it was obviously destroyed and she's pissed off at me and my dad. I've tried contacting her, but she won't answer at all. I admit to being annoyed by her vlogging every now and then, but I still really like her and I care about our relationship. But I'm really worried about her breaking up with me over this. What should I do to fix this?",relationship_advice
my ex boyfriend committed suicide and I am being blamed,"Thank you to everyone that took the time to reply or message me I want to reply to everyone, but I really didn't think I would get this many replies. I am VERY grateful for the support. I never thought I would resort to posting on a website for help, but I am glad I did. I am going to take the advice and go to therapy and am probably going to come back to this thread a lot to re read the replies when the guilt creeps in. I read every single one and hearing 'its not your fault' over 200 times did help. It is going to be a tough road to finding happiness/normalcy again, but hearing that some of you have gone through similar situations and made it through is truly so comforting. I have felt so alone through this and too ashamed to talk about it to people in my life. This helped way more than I thought it would.

My ex bf died by getting out of a car on the freeway. I was not there when it happened but am being held responsible because he did it because of me and was saying he was upset over me before getting out of the car(he was drunk). we dated off and on for two years and had a pretty volatile relationship. he cheated on me and lied a lot and I always took him back but built resentment towards him. this led to me making mean comments and not being super supportive or nice all the time. I knew he had issues with depression and he was hospitalized a few months before he passed. he accused me multiple times of cheating on him while he was in the hospital and it was so hurtful because I was miserable the whole time he was there. looking up on forums like this on what to do and for help.

we got back together and he ended up cheating on me 2 more times that I know of. we still kept in contact and continued the vicious cycle of I'm sorry I love you I need you to I cheated and am lying behind your back until I was finally at my breaking point. I felt like he genuinely was sorry for the things he did but it hurt so bad. I loved and cared for him so much and gave him so many chances and it always ended the same and I couldn't do it anymore. I could see myself becoming depressed and acting in ways that wasnt me.  I started talking to other guys bc I think I thought if i did I would feel better about what he did to me.

I was so mad and told him I slept with someone else and how I was finally done and that he was a piece of shit and I couldn't be apart of his life and to let me move on. I spoke out of anger and couldn't recognize that he was ill because I was so caught up in my own hurt and feeling betrayed by him. he died a week later. I feel guilty and confused and have received mean messages from family members and friends for ""being the biggest reason this happened"". he was so hurtful to me and I don't think they know what really went on with us, but they think I'm this evil person that knew he was depressed and bullied him until he couldn't take it anymore. theres many days I feel that I am. someone said he was depressed because I cheated and that I should live with the guilt forever and if I tried to go to the funeral someone would need to plan mine. I am filled with so much regret and can't stop thinking of what I could have done differently. I wish I could have seen past my anger and helped or at least left earlier so I wasnt causing stress. how do I move forward and find peace the self blame/guilt is too much at times.",relationship_advice
My boyfriend (21M) called me (20F) ugly to his friends,"Ok I guess I should clarify that my boyfriend is really handsome. He's tall and takes fitness seriously. And he has a nice face. He's like a 10/10 to me. I was pretty surprised when he showed interest in me because I'm kind of awkward (r/notlikeothergirls just kidding) and not exactly ""hot"". On a good day, I'm probably a 6/10? And that's dressed up and hair and makeup done. I'm not insecure, I don't really care, I still love me for who I am and I've come to terms with the fact that I'll never be hot like those girls on Instagram, I'll just be average looking. But he always tells me that I'm so funny and that I have the best personality so I guess that's what drew him in. He calls me cute all the time too or hot but it's never beautiful or gorgeous. I'm probably just picky though. I do tell him that he's way hotter than me and he just goes like ""whaaaat, nooo, we're perfect for each other"" but it's pretty obvious. Anyway we still love each other and all that like we joke about getting married and having babies. Obviously too soon for that but he does say that he wants to marry me in a few years. 

I was on his phone while he was asleep. No I was not going through his messages, I know he's not cheating on me or anything. But he was texting his friends a lot today so I wanted to see what they were talking about. Basically one of his friends sent a picture of a girl and said she's interested in my boyfriend and she was really hot and my classy and respectful boyfriend said that looking at her pic made him hard. Lol ok whatever. So his friend was like, ok should I give her your number? My boyfriend said no, he's not gonna cheat on me, I'm way better than her. Nice things. His friends were just like bro stop lying, your girlfriend (me) is not cute one bit. My boyfriend just said ""Damn y'all are fucked up 😂😂 she's kinda cute sometimes lmao"". Then his friends kept saying shit how he can get so many other girls and he was like ""ok shes ugly, but she likes butt stuff"" talking about me. 

Maybe I'm over sensitive but I felt so humiliated. Like the whole group chat was dying after that and just making jokes. Like oh she's ugly but she does anal. That's so degrading. I couldn't even read anymore after that, my hands just started shaking and I cried. Currently under the covers writing this up while he's asleep beside me and I feel like crying again. It just made me feel like such shit. I'm not hot or sexy but at least I'm sexually promiscuous! I don't even know. It's honestly rude that he's even talking about our sex life to his friends as a joke anyway. 

I don't know if I should bring it up in the morning or what I should even say. I feel like a kid who was told she was ugly by some bullies on the playground. This sucks. I just wanna disappear. I thought he'd have my back or something",relationship_advice
Husband (33M) cheated on me (32F) with my sister in law (29F),"We went on vacation with my brother and his wife. They're newly married but I always got along with her and I thought she was so nice. She and my husband were very friendly but my husband is really talkative and they work in the same field and they were sweet with each other so I thought it was more of a little sister-older brother relationship.

We went on a trip together and all four of us were at the bar, talking and everything. I was tired and we had a long day so I went upstairs to our room. I woke up a few hours later around 3 am and I texted him but he still wasn't back, so I went downstairs to tell him to come to bed. Well, my brother wasn't there but I saw him and her kissing. And it wasn't like a drunken kiss, they looked pretty fucking comfortable and I know that wasn't the first time

I went back to bed and didn't mention it to him. He is acting especially sweet and I hate him and that bitch ",relationship_advice
I [33M] broke up with my girlfriend [29F]. I've been told that I'm overreacting.,"My ex an I were in a relationship for three months and dating for four before that.  

We weren't exclusive during those four months, and we were just casually dating. After four months, I realized how happy she made me, and decided that I wanted to make it official. So I asked her to be my girlfriend. She smiled and said she really liked me but she wasn't sure she wanted to put a title on things, and asked if I would give her the weekend to think about it.  

I figured it was a blow off, but on that Sunday she called me up and said she was absolutely sure the answer was yes.  

We've been very happy and things have gone well, other than that we hadn't had sex yet. She said she wanted to wait until she was ready, which I've been cool with. I understand it, or at least I thought I did.  

So this past weekend, she decided she was ready. I planned a big romantic dinner, took her to see a play, and showed her a very nice time.  

As we got back to my place, I joked that I was glad she was ready because it had been about a year for me. She laughed and said, ""Yeah, I'm sorry.""  

I replied that it was ok and that I respected that she had to be ready because it was probably a while for her too. She started averting her gaze and said, ""Well, not as long as you."" 

I responded, ""We've been involved for seven months. How much not as long?""  

She wanted to drop the subject, but I was upset and kept pressing. She finally admitted that she had been seeing me and someone else at the beginning. She liked me more, but she already had a date set up with this other guy that weekend when I asked her.  

Her friend advised her to go on the date, have sex with the guy, get it out of her system, and say yes to me after so it wouldn't be cheating.  She did exactly this, ended it with him, and called me up after.  

I told her to get out of my car. She started sobbing and apologizing saying that it was a mistake. I told her I didn't care. I told her that she lied to me, as far as I'm concerned she absolutely did cheat, she buried it for three months, and then acted like sex was something special and important to her when in actuality it was something to get out of her system with someone else.  

I told her it was over and I never wanted to see her again. She begged me to forgive her and I told her it's not happening.  

She's texted me numerous apologies saying she wishes she could go back and change it and I've ignored her. Her friend, yes the one that gave her the advice, called me up and said that I should be mad at her and not my ex. I replied that I actually am angry with both of them because they are both terrible people.  

A friend of mine told me that I was overreacting and we weren't exclusive until she said yes, but that feels like such contrived garbage to me that I won't even hear it. Am I overreacting? Did I make the right choice?",relationship_advice
I cussed at my dad's girlfriend because she asked me something weird. My dad got mad at me and expects me to apologize to her,"I've(15M) known her for an year and I have normal relationship with her. She stays at our home often.

So, few days ago she came, my boyfriend was leaving at the same time and they saw each other. I went to kitchen and started making something, she came in and asked ""so you're the girl huh?"" I didn't even understand the question at first. What kinda question is that. I'm really wondering what answer she was expecting. 

I looked at her,didn't say anything and continued what I was doing. She repeated it again. I told her to fuck off. She got upset and told ME that I was being inappropriate. She told my dad about it and he also said that I shouldn't have cussed at her no matter what. I didn't apologize to her, she's waiting for it.",relationship_advice
My [26/F] coworker [early 30s/M] follows me into the bathroom every time I go. HR won't do anything because evidently he identifies as gender fluid sometimes. What are my options?,"This started a few weeks ago out of the blue. I really can't just walk away from my job because my husband and I have a 2 year old daughter and my husband is a stay at home dad to cover daycare costs right now and for the next couple of years. 

I've had this job for three years and my coworker just started a few months ago. He always seemed a little strange to everyone, but nice enough and no big deal. We always invite him out to happy hours and everyone likes him. 

But a few weeks ago I was startled when a minute after I went to the bathroom he followed me in (it is multi stall). I asked what he was doing and he said the men's was full (this a huge building so there would have to be at least 5 men in the bathroom for it to be full). 

I thought it was weird, but no big deal. But it kept happening. And I've noticed he only does it when I go to the bathroom, like every time because I have to pass by his desk. I'm one of only 4 women on our floor as opposed to about 12 men. 

I've gone to HR and they told me that they had complaints from other women and spoke to him. He told them that he is gender fluid and sometimes identifies as a woman, sometimes as a man, so there is nothing they can do. 

I'm not transphobic, I'm not a bigot, but I don't know what to do. He is getting creepier and creepier. Even other people in the office have noticed he is following me to the bathroom. 

The last few times he hasn't even used it, it just sounds like he stands in the stall until I leave. 

Is there anything I can do? I don't feel like this is right and I don't think I should have to leave my job over it. I support my family with this job. I cry when I'm alone because of this. I haven't even told my husband because I don't want him to worry.

Wife [34F] is gay. I [32M] caught her in our bed with her best friend [33F],"I found my wife, whom I've been married to for almost 8 years now and have two adorable kids with, in our bed with her best friend. My immediate reaction was to scream like a crazy man and throw things at both of them. I was devastated. 

&nbsp;

Later that day, I went back home to talk to her and she told me that she has been in love with her friend for years now, she said she loves me and the kids but it is a different kind of love. According to her, she has been attracted to girls ever since she can remember but when she agreed to marry me she was in love with me. She said she didn't intend to ever cheat on me but she thinks that her friend is the love of her life. I thought I could die right there and then.

&nbsp;

It has been three weeks since I found out about her and her friend. She didn't only make me live in a lie all those years, but she actually wants me to continue living the lie. She promises she will cut off all ties with her friend (whom she said is the love of her life btw), and she wants to work hard to save our marriage for the sake of our sons. but I can't even look at her right now. At the same time, I'm not sure I want a divorce. I'm disgusted with myself because I feel deep down, beneath all my pain and anger, that I still have feelings for her

&nbsp;

Update: Thank you everyone. There's a small detail I failed to mention although it won't change much. I failed to mention that my wife and I are both of Arab descent. Coming out as a gay person is still not acceptable in our community even though we are Americans and I think that plays a factor in why she'd want to stay in the marriage. But it doesn't change anything for me. I'm still the one who's been cheated on. I won't deny that at times I thought of ""outing her"" to our families and friends as an act of revenge but that won't do anyone any good, right? 

I haven't been with any other woman in my entire life. I met her my first year in university and that was that. I'm not sure I know how to date or approach women romantically anymore. I think I've been hestitant about the divorce for fear of being alone in the long run but I've read all your comments and I thank you all for the insights. ",relationship_advice
"I [22F] kept my sexual abuse a secret from my entire family for 15 years. Today, everyone found out.","I was around 6-7 when an uncle of mine sexually abused me repeatedly. It was absolutely horrible. I lived with a lot of emotional pain for a very long time. However I dealt with it internally and it took me many years to be in a good place mentally. After a long tome, I finally learned to not let it control my life and I was happy. The whole time, NO ONE knew. No one in my family had any idea. My mom had a suspicion but I always refused to admit it to her out of embarrassment.

Today, the same uncle who sexually abused me( let's call him X) accused another uncle  (Y) of  being aggressive with X's 10 yr old son. Now multiple people who all saw the incident say it was very playful and in no way violent/abusive. But X insists that it was and wants to take this to court and press charges on Y. This argument really blew up. And my mom decided it was time to confront X on his behaviors with me to end his hypocrisy and let him know that he needed to stop bullying members of the family. 

After she said it, I burst into tears. My whole family heard it. Now everyone knows. All my aunts and uncles. My younger cousins, my siblings. I can tell some of them are heartbroken for me. Others I think are in shock. By my aunt (X's wife) doesn't believe it even though he used to abuse her as well. I think she is the only member of the family who thinks I'm lying. I feel so embarrassed and I haven't stopped crying because I've had to relive the memories all day. I had buried them for over two years. I am typing this at work and I don't even want to go home because I am feeling so embarrassed. I don't know why I feel like ashamed. I have nothing to be ashamed about but I still feel it. I feel dirty and exposed and I don't think my life will ever be the same anymore. But the worst is that there's someone who doesn't believe it ever happened

TL;DR my uncle sexually abused me as a child. I kept it a secret and never told anyone. My mom had her suspicions. Today my family had a falling out and my mom brought up her suspicion to the whole family. I finally confirmed and most believe me but my aunt thinks I'm lying. Everyone knows now. I feel ashamed and dirty and I feel like i never want to see any of them again. 


Update: I didn't expect to receive so much support when I posted this. Thank you for the overwhelming compassion and kindness you are showing me. It truly is making it a little bit easier to get through today. ",relationship_advice

"My (19F) friend (18M) shared some very disturbing sexual fantasies with me, and I really can't stop thinking about it","The other day I was out for the night with my friend group.

One of my best friends in the group is a guy (most are girls). He and I are pretty close and have been since early in high school.

We were kind of separated from everyone else and drinking alone. The topic of sex and relationships came up. I started teasing him about never having had a steady girlfriend, which led to the subject of sexual fantasies and preferences coming up, and he admitted he had some 'weird ones'.

I asked him what he was talking about, because I was curious. He didn't want to say, so I tried to loosen him up by describing some of my fantasies, which was mostly (in his view) fairly 'vanilla' stuff like role play and stuff. Finally, once he'd gotten fairly drunk, he said he had 'really violent' kinks. I said that wasn't that unusual. He said he didn't mean 'like BDSM stuff'.

Finally, he told me he fantasizes about 'grabbing a girl and driving her out in the middle of nowhere and just slashing her fucking throat or bashing her skull in.' Most of these fantasies didn't even involve sex or even violent sex, it was the killing itself that was a sexual act to him. It was like a filter had come off now and he starts telling me all about it. He said he really got off on the image of a girl begging for her life. He also said the only kind of porn that could even get him off was (simulated, not real) death/murder porn.

The whole thing and the detail he went into really shook me up. I get that fantasies are harmless as long as they don't cross the line into reality, but I honestly wasn't expecting anything like this. I'm a girl and most of our friends are actually girls, which makes it a little scarier for me.

I feel bad for making this post because I feel like I'm betraying his trust, and I'm the one who pushed him to tell me, but I honestly couldn't stop thinking about this and it's really bothering me.

He's a really sweet, soft-spoken guy in general, but on the rare occasions he gets angry, it's really scary. He gets *really* angry, and seeing it in his face is almost like seeing a mask come off. It reminds me a little of what they used to say about Ted Bundy.

I don't think he's in imminent danger of hurting anyone, and I don't think he really would, but I'm wondering if I should suggest he look into therapy or at least talk to someone?

Am I overreacting? Are these kinds of fantasies relatively common amongst guys? I really don't know, but this is driving me crazy!

TL;DR friend of mine told me his sexual fantasizes involve torturing and killing girls and he can't even get off without it. I'm really shaken up now.",relationship_advice
My girlfriend is inviting herself to help me with a job and take half of my pay. She got upset that I told her I didn't need her help.,"My girlfriend had told me that she was going to hang out with her friend tomorrow morning, so I figured I would occupy my time somehow. An opportunity arrived at work to make a simple 1 hour long delivery for a good chunk of change. I figured that it was easy money and also a good way to wait for my girlfriend to get home.

Turns out that my girlfriend's plans for the morning weren't official and that when I told her about the job, she decided that she wanted to be apart of it, even though it is a very simple job that would NEVER need two people to accomplish. She said that she should tag along and we should make a day date trip out of it. I agreed because yes that would be fun, spend the day on the town together somewhere. So because my family is limited on cars right now, we would need to take her car instead so we can have it the whole day. She said that because we were taking her car I would need to give her half of the pay. I thought it was a little harsh but I agreed that it was fair because it was her car.

I found out that I would be able to take my own car and keep it out for the day, and the fact that its a much nicer and comfortable car for long distances, I told her we would no longer need her car.

Cue her getting pissed at me saying that ""I"" am being greedy for trying to screw her out of the money. Like I'm the bad guy for wanting to take my own car and not put 200 miles on her older car for no reason. I told her she can come with me but she still wants half the money for just ""being there"". Like it's only 2 boxes, I'm more than capable of doing it on my own with a hand tied behind my back. 

I would not have even taken this job if I knew she wasn't hanging out with her friend :(",relationship_advice
My adopted brother feels as though the family doesn't love him,"

My parents have 5 kids. 27F, 26M, then me and my twin and our adopted brother are all 23, and we are 23F (me) then two 23M's. 

John was adopted when his bio parents who were close friends with our parents died when he was a few months old.

So this has been a slowly building thing for years now but really got called to everyone's attention I've the past 5 years. 

I remember growing up with ""John"" normally as any siblings would and all of our other siblings say the same. We played we fought we made up we broke our parents' shit. 


The past 5 years have been somewhat strange. At first we thought it was just John being John but now after I've spoken with him we discovered it was more than we thought.

First off, John left the day he turned 18, which was a surprise because he had good grades and everyone assumed he'd go to college like the rest of us. He graduated one semester early and left the house on his 18th birthday which was a shock to everyone.

He earned money doing chore work for our dad and uncles and had bought his own car and apparently saved enough to get an apartment. It was weird and my parents were sad but more than that they were proud and happy for him. 

Dad offered John money to help him start out life on his own but John refused and said he'd be fine. 

My parents were insanely proud of John. They're not typically the ""brag on my kid"" kind of people but they were telling everyone how independent and responsible and mature and fearless John was. 

Now it's important to note that us siblings were always fairly close. I cried the first night John was gone and wanted my dad to figure out a way to make him come back because I was scared he die or something.

So when the communication suddenly was almost nothing, it was weird and we missed him but our parents said that he was busy working and taking care of himself and that when he'd settled and figured things out, he'd be back to his normal self.

It never happened though and he also stopped really talking to them. He'd talk to us around birthdays and holidays but even then it was strange. He always tries to meet up with siblings for dinner or drinks on birthdays, always visits our parents ""very quickly"" on their birthdays and mother's/father's day, and on Thanksgiving and Christmas, he is in and out. 

For example, our older brother was the only one there when John was there for or mom's most recent birthday and he said John was ""very clinical"". And that it felt more like a soldier was paying respect to a commanding officer than anyone visiting their parents.

One thing about this that stood out was that John talked to our mom and dad and brother about a lot going on in his life. Apparently he's got a girlfriend and just got s dog and has a great new job in construction.

No one knew any of this and Dad cracked a joke about how they were terrible parents because how could they not know anything about what was going on in one of their kid's lives. 

After John left our mom looked sad and when our older brother asked her what was wrong she said that it felt like John didn't want to be around her and that she missed him before she refused to say anything more about it.


So our older brother started a group chat with everyone but John to ask about if any of us had noticed anything wrong with him. Wed all talked about how distant he'd been over the years but never like this talk. 


At the end of it, we all arranged to meet up with John and try to talk to him to make sure everything was okay.

It took some effort to get him to open up but he finally did and what he said has really rocked our family. 

He said that, ""I'm not their real son."" We all immediately tried to reassure him that mom and dad love him and we do too but he had all these stories about how mom and dad treated him differently. 

There were lots of examples. Things like older brother would hug or kiss mom on the cheek but she'd push John off if he tried the same. Dad would happily talk Sports with anyone, but would be short with John. Our grandparents were never excited to see him, aunts and uncles not interested in him or his hobbies or what was going on at school.

One incident where dad asked each boy to go on a hunting trip and never asked John until they were leaving and when he did finally ask, you could tell dad was annoyed (and my brothers did confirm this one because they thought it was weird how dad acted too). When John said he was fine with not going they said dad looked happy about it. 

John would ask for help with school work, mom or dad would say they were tired or tell him to ask teachers but they'd stay up with the rest of us.

You get the idea. There was a lot of stuff and enough of us witnessed it that we don't think he was misremembering things or making them up. 

John wasn't bitter or angry about this. He said that he understood that they wouldn't be able to love him the same way they loved us and that, ""it would be inhuman of me to ask that of them."" Which broke my heart.

He said he refused the money from dad because he would have felt badly about him using it on him instead of his ""real children"" 

He said he will always love them and respect them and be grateful for their sacrifices for raising him, but that it was too painful to be around them for too long because he knew they couldn't be what he wanted and that he couldn't be what they wanted. 

Our oldest sister was impassioned by this and told my parents about it. It was a shitshow. Mom crying, dad punching a wall. They're both ashamed and hurt and insist that they love him just as much as they do therest of us.

Now that John knows our parents know he's upset and is apprehensive about coming around, which is understandable. 

We love our brother and our parents love him too and we all miss him. How do we fix this?

**editing this to add that I just learned from her that apparently mom had a talk with John and asked him if he had any ""improper"" feelings about us which holy shit if nothing else made him feel like an outsider that did.**

Wife tickles our son inappropriately - cause for concern?,"Hi everyone. My wife and I are are mid thirties and we have two children - a 3 year old girl and a 7 month old boy.

I've noticed lately that my wife tickles my son a lot, which is fine I think, except she tickles him in the diaper area if you know what I mean.

She often does this after changing his diaper or even just sometimes during the day randomly.

I've asked her about this and her response was ""what do you think? I am molesting him or something?""

I told her no not necessarily but I think this is frickin weird and I want you to stop?

She then laughs and tells me that if that's the first thing that comes to mind that I must be the one that she should be keeping and eye on and not Vice versa.

I know that she was a victim of child sexual abuse when she was younger so I understand why she is so sensitive and defensive about this issue, but it's it true that victims of molestation are more likely to molest others?

I don't want to call the police on her but I don't know what else to do. Even if I did there's no way to prove it - it's just my word against hers.

I'm also afraid that she might go into hysterics and accuse me of hurting her if I do call the police. Which she actually did once in college when we got into an argument. She threw herself out my car while I was driving and then told the police that I pushed her out. She's gotten therapy since then and never did that again but I wonder if she might try it again if she felt threatened.

Oh also one more thing - she never did this to our daughter, the behavior is exclusive to our son from what I can tell.

I'm really lost as to what to do. Are there any resources for men who suspect that a woman in their love is molesting someone?

Thanks in advance.",relationship_advice

I don't know how to feel tbh.

EDIT: Yes, he agreed to go with me. He bailed out an HOUR before we were supposed to leave. He's not trying to win his ex back, she's actually the one obsessed with him and he doesn't see it.

I did reach out to other people to see if they wanted to come with me instead, no reply. 

I didn't go by myself because that wasn't the point of me buying the tickets. I didn't want to sit through the show upset about what just happened.


EDIT 2: I've read all your reply's, and 99% of you have valid advice. A little backstory, I met (let's call him Alex) on a dating app. 
When we first met, he told me he still saw his ex and that they slept together from time to time. I was grossed out, but I believe him we they said they were strictly friends. Alex and her hung out for awhile in our relationship. It was hard for him to have time for me because he was always with his ex.

One time, I called Alex because I was panicking over an event that happened - they were hanging out and she SCREAMED at him because he was on the phone with me. She threatened to kill her self if he didn't get off the phone with me. Alex, never hung the phone up and argued with her for hours before she drove away.

About the ""he doesn't see it part"" - all he used to tell me was he knows she's crazy but she's still his ""friend""
""She's still my friend"" he would say to me.

tl;dr - I'm aware of their ""platonic relationship"", She's crazy, he knows she's crazy. I don't say much to him about their relationship because I don't want to seem crazy. 

As of today, they are no longer friends. They don't talk - from what I'm aware of. I see him more. He's actually happy he doesn't see her anymore.

EDIT 3: I know I'm dumb. This happened when we first started dating. I'm just now sharing what happened.
Alex is a vulnerable guy, his ex definitely got into his head. I'm unsure if what I'm feeling is Retroactive Jealousy or if my feelings are rational. I'm pretty sure ever since they broke up - probably the entire relationship - she has been manipulating him. His family doesn't like her. His friends don't like her. I tried to be her friend, but she wouldn't budge. I've never met her.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] Wife (31F) and I(34M) are broken and Im thinking of divorce.,"Someone messaged me asking for a followup on my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/anwmeo/wife_31f_and_i34m_are_broken_and_im_thinking_of/) . Ive started , stopped and rewritten this post a few times over several days already to so if it seems a little incoherent, sorry. Lots went on but Ill keep it short as possible.

&#x200B;

That Saturday after my original post I tried again to talk to her about what I felt was missing in our relationship. This did not go well. The next Staurday I went out and rented an apartment with a lease starting March 1st. I  went back home and told her I would be moving out. I said I did not know what was going on with her and since she did not want to do anything about it  I wanted a divorce. I loved her but I couldnt live like a hostage anymore. She got really quiet and then started sobbing and telling me that I was cruel and selfish and that my focus on sex was the issue and that I should go to counseling for that (again).  I was hoping that she would have said somehting else but since she didnt I just started packing a few things for work. She asked me where I was going and told her I would be staying at my parents for the next few weeks until my lease started.

&#x200B;

As soon as I told her I  would be staying at my parents she got really quiet and asked me if Id told my parents yet. Sirens started going off in my head immediately. I said that I had not (this was lie). Then she got quiet for about 5 minutes and right when I was about to walk out the door she asked me not to leave. She wanted to talk.  And then she told me something I didnt want to hear.

&#x200B;

She'd cheated on me with a guy in her class last year. And got an STD.  Nothing fatal but not the kind you can get rid of . She told me that it only happened one time but I am sure that is not true. I was numb. ( One of my female friends told me that wife cheating was a possibility but I didnt believe it) .  I didn't say anything while wife talked. MOstly because my mind was reeling but also because I didnt really have anything to say. I realize now that I had said everything I had to say over the course of the previous year and now I had nothing.  After she finished talking  I just told her ok. I was numb. And I left the house with her in it and went to my parents house about 2 hours away. I told her I would be back but have not been back to the house or seen her since.

&#x200B;

I got to my parents house and told them everything . They told me they could tell something was wrong for a few months and that they were sorry.I had planned to go back to the house but my mother told me that if I was moving forward with divorce that I should not go . So my mother and father went and got a few personal items for me. Everything else I left. I also contacted a lawyer and told him to contact wife to start the divorce.

&#x200B;

Wife has called me on cell and at work a few times and even emailed me  but I didn't read it.  She also  had one of her friends call me and tell me to please talk to my wife and that she is very sorry but as soon as I realized it was a friend of hers I hung up.  I have  two weeks off coming up in April and I plan to go to Vegas with a buddy.  My parents and friends have been very supportive and I honestly feel better than I have felt in a long time.

&#x200B;

I never thought I would get divorced. And that first week I felt like a failure because I knew my marriage was over. But my father told me something that I have said to myself over and over. ""Someone else doing the wrong thing makes them the failure. Not you . ""

&#x200B;

I hung out this weekend with a girl from my job who Ive always gotten along with . She saw me at work last week without my ring and asked me what happened. I told her that my wife and I were divorcing. She gave me a hug in the office and that hug felt like the best thing in the world. After work this weekend we  went out for a few drinks and just hung out and had fun and ended up back at my place.  Im not ready for nor do I want a relationship obviously but it felt so good to be in a bed with a woman where it felt so relaxed and accepting. I felt completely at ease.  I know the divorce is going to be tough but this weekend even after all thats happened I feel like it will be worth it.

Husband [31] makes fun of me [25] around his family for earning little money,"We are married for six months now. He started doing this about two months ago and does it often since then. 
He earns about 3k monthly while I get just 750€. I work as sales assistant in retail, he is a process mechanic. That being said before we married he tried to convince me to staying home and promised to care about me but I didn't want that, I also wanted to work.
Now he makes fun about my earnings, mostly on family events. He says things like ""I need vacation. What about you go to work and I take some free time for myself? Oh but wait, we would starve with your pay, right?"" 
""Get a real job""
""What you are tired? I wish you could work at our company for one day, then you would know what it is to be tired!""


I felt awful maybe because he is right, he pays our rent our bills and everything but I tought we had a balance by me doing all the houshold and paying for groceries, cook and so on.
I told him that I don't like it when he makes my job looking worthless but he just says that it's the truth because I dont earn much money. We started to fight because of this almost every day. I don't know what to do. I tough about doing a second job but I don't know how to manage it because I also do distance learning. Any advices?

Tl;dr: husband seems to be annoyed that I earn little money. I don't know what to do to make things work again.",relationship_advice

Trying to make my[29M] fiancé [27F] (somewhat) okay that I don't want to fight cancer that will make me lose my penis,"Yesterday I got some pretty shitty news that I have penis cancer (penile carcinoma) after going in for an examination of discoloration/hard lump of skin on my penis last week. I got more tests and my doctor essentially told me that it's stage 3 bordering on stage 4 and the only solution is total removal of my penis including the internal part of the member (called a radical penectomy- I learned a new word.). I would have to have my urethra rerouted so I peed through an incision in my pereneum. I'd still have my testicles. 

After a long talk about emotional support and what life would be like he was trying to schedule surgery and I told him that I had to think about it. He told me it was going to spread and I was going to die and I still told him I had to think about it. I asked if radiation or chemo could work and he said it was too advanced but could buy me a little time. He was trying to explain to me the gravity of the situation and I essentially said"" I get it I'm choosing between having a dick for a short while and dying or living to old age without my dick."" He tried to tell me that by the end my dick would be non functional and may turn into a deformed mass of cancerous tumors and I'd be peeing through a catheter in my abdomen.I know he was just trying to scare me into doing what he considered the right thing but I feel like this is better. My thought process is that while they may awful I wouldn't have to deal with it very long as opposed to 50ish years without a penis. Before I even left I had my mind made up as I cried in the parking lot.

The hard part and the part where I may be very selfish is I had to break the news to my fiancé (I'd still marry her if that's what she wants but I doubt it'll happen now) which I wanted to put off for a couple days to not upset her and also explain myself properly.

 I considered lying and saying It was already terminal to spare her and I any conflict in the rest of my time with her but I didn't want to live that lie when I wanted to spend so much time with her before I go or have her somehow find out later and look back on me differently. I felt I owed her the truth because I do love her very much and was planning on marrying her, so I told her that was going to let myself die instead of living without my penis. 

She knew about the tests and stuff but she didn't know what the possibilities were because even discussing them made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't want to worry her if it turned out to be nothing. I told her there was something I needed to tell her and that it wasn't good news. I told her about the cancer and that I was not going to live like that. 

She didn't say anything for a minute. She asked me if my dick meant more than being with her (this was not a passive aggressive or manipulation tactic she was legitimately asking) I told her that I loved her more than my dick but that I couldn't see her body every day and get these urges I couldn't at all act on (we have sex almost every night), I couldn't deal with constant insecurity of not feeling like a real man or that I couldn't please her and I couldn't deal with anyone knowing. She said that there was other types of sex besides PIV and that we could make it work. I told her that I would not be the same person if i went through with it and she would feel stuck with me being depressed and angry but because she was the one that convinced me to live and I would likely never be able to find someone again she would stay in an unhappy marriage just so I wasn't alone. She said that she wouldn't feel stuck she'd take care of me for as long as I needed it and then we would just be a normal couple.I told her that I wouldn't be able to function as a human being and she would either never vent to anyone ever about how I'm not the same or completely violate my trust by telling any person what was wrong with me that caused me to act like that. I couldn't deal with anyone else knowing,  I couldn't deal with being ""the guy with no dick"". She said she'd never tell a soul and we could get individual and couples counseling for any psychological issues I would understandably have. I said no and that I would not live my life constantly feeling the loss but I did offer to seek therapy with her as long as it wasn't about convincing me to change my mind. She said that she knew she couldn't understand what it'd be like to be a guy without a penis but she felt that life was better than death. I said I wanted my full life and not one with a huge chunk missing. She told me I was stronger than I thought and we would have each other. I asked if she really wanted me to live a life where I'd rather be dead. She said ""no, but how do you know you wouldn't be able to adjust?"" I told her that not being able to have real intercourse with her, having her see me deformed and me constantly worrying that she didn't think of me as a real man or thought less of me, living with the fear that at some point I would piss her off so much she would use it as part of an insult, or that she would miss PIV sex and try to find someone else. To be clear she has never done anything at all to justify these fears, but I can't deal with the fear of it. I said I would lose all self respect and would never feel like I could stick up for myself because I would feel so far beneath everyone as less of a man and unworthy of women. I can't deal with the idea that she might tell someone and swear them to secrecy and then I'm talking to this person the whole time they're thinking about how I don't have a penis.

She told me she loved me that she would be gentle, kind and understanding, would always be faithful and would never make fun of me and that she planned to spend the rest of her life with me. I told her that I loved her that I hoped she would stay until the end but I would understand if she wanted to leave because I was making a selfish decision. She then went back and forth between being angry and then remembering I have cancer and trying to comfort me. I told her that I was sorry but my decision wouldn't be changed. I also asked she not tell anyone about this especially my family who she is close with. I know I gave her the news and asked her to carry the burden by herself but I don't want more people to try to talk me out of it and I don't want people to know in general. 

She cried the rest of the day and kept coming up with hypotheticals like advancements in medical procedures to replace it one day and other ways I could feel ""whole"". I told her that I loved her and I didn't want to hurt her but I also didn't want to hurt me. She was in our bedroom and I thought I should give her space so I got ready to sleep on the couch but she came and asked me to come to bed. We cuddled and she said we could always have this form of intimacy but I pointed out that my penis against her butt was making me aroused and that I couldn't deal with never feeling that again. We then just sort of cried for a couple hours. Neither of us slept last night but I still feel the same today. She tried to talk to me more and how she was looking up ways I could still orgasm and testimonials of people who had gone through with it and were happy being alive. I pointed out these were all guys in their 60's and up and I'm not even 30 yet. We both took the day off but i am treating it like a normal day off instead of whatever she wants me to be doing (either acquiescing or grieving I think) and so when I went to binge watch netflix she said I'm not taking my life seriously. I told her I do take my life seriously but I take the quality of my life just as serious if not more so. I also told her that me not taking almost anything seriously was one of the reasons she fell for me, I thought I was lightening the mood but she just got mad.

She asked what if I get to the point of no return and then regret not having saved my own life. I told her that just because I was choosing to die didn't mean I wasn't scared of it and that being overwhelmed I may make wishes about what I could have or should have done but right now while I'm of sound mind this is what I want.

She kept looking at me like she's going to say something and then didn't and I tell her that she can voice any feelings she has but instead she just says ""I love you"" or something when I know that's not what she's thinking. I told her I can quit work and we can blow through my savings on some trip or something but she basically said how she'd have responsibilities after I was gone and couldn't. It's almost 8 and she hasn't asked me to come to the bedroom so I think I'm on the couch although she could just expect to go in when I'm ready. 

I just feel so torn because I know can't expect her to be okay with this but I want her to be. I am having the thought that maybe we should end our relationship so she doesn't have to force herself thought this. I don't want to go through this alone but I'm not the one who's going to have to deal with this through old age and she will. I love her and I want whatever is going to be best for her without having to live without my penis. Anything else I would be fine with as long as it was in her best interest.

I know that this situation will traumatize her but I think she'll move on. I don't think I could move on and I don't want to try and feel stuck in a life I don't want at all.

I just wish I could show her how much I cared without having to live with such a big part of my life missing. I am ready to go down with the ship but I want her to know how special she is and was to me. She is the one, she's perfect for me and I wish I could stay for her but I know psychologically it will be too damaging and that she will likely suffer with my unhappiness for decades. I can't stiff upper lip it and live a life entirely for her which is what i'd be doing if I did change my mind. I know that might sound selfish.

I believe she wants me to live because she thinks it's what's best for me not because she is being selfish in trying to keep me around. She has not tried to make it ""aren't I worth it?"" Sort of guilt trip because she knows that's not fair. We have always argued well. We haven't had sex since I told her which is usually daily unless one of us is sick which I guess technically I am. If she decides she can't handle me choosing to die and leaves she will be the last person I've been with no matter what opportunities present themselves.

I want to emotionally support her through this if she chooses to stay but I feel like expecting her to rely on me when I'm the one making a choice that will lead to her suffering is unfair to her.  I feel like I'm a lot more calm than she is and I don't think that's unreasonable but I want her to be at least somewhat okay with my choice. 

 I don't think she's in the wrong at all, I completely understand her feelings and they are absolutely valid but they don't change my mind. I feel like even if she wants to leave she will stay until the end even though I stressed she is free to go if she wants to/needs to and that it wouldn't change how I feel about her at all. 

P.s. I know that a majority of men would choose their lives and I don't judge them for it or think less of them. This is about me and how I would feel about myself. 

TLDR: I'm choosing death over a life without my dick and my fiancé is trying to convince me to stay and I want her to be at least more okay with me dying. 

I don't know who to talk to about this so I guess I'm here.

EDIT: I have a lot to think about. I have been defending myself this whole thread and maybe you all are right but it seems a lot of people here who aren't going through are giving advice on something they will never experience. 4 days ago I would've said ""oh yeah I'd cut it off"" but now I'm actually dealing with it and it's not that simple. I just want to be the same person I am now and that's not an option.

For the few responses that said choose life but were actually nice about it instead of insulting me. Thank you. I will really think about it. These responses actually meant just as much to me as the ones that agreed with me.

My fiancé is my world. I'm going to be a completely different person physically and mentally and not knowing if she can deal with that and still having gone through with the loss and she finally chooses herself over me I'm stuck dickless and alone.

I'm going to go talk to her. I don't know where it will go.

Edit 2: i think I should mention I was bullied a lot as a child and I thought I was over it but this has brought back all those feelings about being an outcast and not part of the group. The comments section did not help those feelings go away.
I told her how I fear she'll change her mind later if I'm too much to handle. I told her I was worried she'd be disgusted by me and that she would never think of me the same. I told her how my own insecurity about it would make me very paranoid about everything and everyone. I told her how I would only ever want her to know and that would make me feel like she would so much power over me. That I would be too much of burden and she'd start to look for someone to vent to or just have an emotional connection with while I fear I won't be emotionally available and that friendship will blossom into something more and she will leave me. I told I worried that I would never be comfortable with her having male friends because I would feel inferior and that she would think I was controlling. I told her I was afraid that I wouldn't ever want to go out in public.  I told her how afraid I was of being alive and feeling like a completely different person compared to being dead when I wouldn't have to deal with the loss. I worry I'lI never again feel comfortable in my own skin again and that these changes will drive her away and that if I stayed it would only be for her and that if she left then I'd feel like I did it all for nothing. I cried and she held me. We cuddled and she just told me how much she loved me and that she would do anything to make me happy and give me anything I need. But at the end I told her I would keep my mind open and that I was open to talking about it more. I really don't want this life but I want her to be happy. I love her more than anything. I am not saying that I've changed my mind but i want to make her part of the process.

I'm getting a second opinion tomorrow and talk time tables. I asked her to come with me. We're looking at finding a therapist.

This is the last time I'll do this I just have some positive news and I thought that would be nice to share. Just venting people you don't have to get your panties all twisted over this. I also still haven't  told anybody so that's why I'm here. Friday night I ended up staying at a friends house because I was so pissed at my husband. After I saw what he did to the tv I was very upset and I didn't want to be around him. Last night he called me and asked me to come home. (Very late at like 2am) I came home only because the late call made me worried. I'm glad I did tho. He sold his Xbox for $350 and bought a new tv. He agreed to therapy and basically broke down and told me what has been going on in his head and why he was so angry. He said he is making a life style change and instead of playing fifa he is going to join an actual football team again. He then handed me the $200 for my credit card. He also told me that his boss is opening up another restaurant and asked him to be his main cook. There is a $10 an hour pay raise which is going to help us out of this shitty financial place.Feeling hopeful. I'm happy I never threw the work divorce at him.",relationship_advice
I've caught my father in law masturbating while staring at his teenage granddaughters,"My (30/f) husband's (38/m) father (65/m) recently moved into our guest house after losing his business and his life savings to a nasty gambling habit. He says he's just a transient and will be moving out soon, but he's broke and doesn't seem to have a realistic plan, so I don't see how that will happen.

The problem is I have seen him several times masturbating while looking into our backyard and pool, as my husband's teenage daughters (17 & 14) are sunbathing or hanging around the pool. Yes, his own granddaughters.

From our second floor nursery window, I can see directly into the guest house and pool area. I've even taken phone video with the intention of showing my husband, but I haven't had the courage to do it. My husband's father is his hero, so I don't know how he'll react and how that will affect our family.

My step daughters, whom I love like my own, live in booty shorts and bikini tops. That's all they wear around the house, and they always have. When I married my husband in 2015 and moved in, I immediate raised concerns about their lack of clothing around the house, but it was a battle I lost early on.

Their mother passed away when they were very little, and my husband raised them as a single father. Even though they accepted me in their lives and we've always gotten along great, they see me more as an older friend than as a motherly figure.  And to be fair, their wardrobe hasn't been a problem until now.

So yes, I have disturbing video and it's very clear what he's doing and whom he's looking at while doing it. Since I first saw him doing it about a month ago, I have done everything in my power to keep the girls physically away from him, but I have a baby boy and a part time job, so it hasn't been easy because I'm not always there.

I cringe when he gets near them and starts caressing their hair or touching their bare skin. I've asked the girls to cover up ""out of respect for their grandpa"", but they look at me like I'm the crazy one.

But this is actually driving me insane because it's like clockwork now. As soon as the girls go out to the pool area, he sits by the window and starts touching himself. After a while he stands up, walks closer to the window, pulls out his penis, and gets himself off. And because I have recorded him, now I sort of feel like a dirty pervert myself.

I have thought about confronting him, telling him what I've seen, and asking him to leave or I'll tell his son, but I'm afraid the confrontation could turn violent.

Sp what can I do? If I show my husband the video proof, I have no idea how he'll react. He's not argumentative or hot blooded, but this is difficult to watch.

I have also worked very hard to become a friend and a confidant to those two beautiful girls, and I don't want them to hate me for exposing their perverted grandfather.

I love the girls, I love my husband, and we have a one year old child. I fear this could destroy our happy family, and that eventually I'll be the one to blame.

TL;DR -- I've caught my father in law masturbating while staring at his teenage granddaughters. I don't now how to tell my husband or how to proceed.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (33m) overheard my girlfriend (28f) making fun of me pretty brutally to her best friend (27m). When I say brutally... I mean brutally.,"Link to original post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/56j6zw/i_33m_overheard_my_girlfriend_28f_making_fun_of/

Well, supportive Reddit strangers, I stayed strong and broke up with Jenna Thursday evening. This has honestly been the most dramatic couple of days of my entire life. I am exhausted. Things got pretty ugly on her part. Sorry that this is so long, a lot happened.

At the suggestion of my friends, mother, brother, and many of you, I talked to her in a private but still public place. The thought behind that was that someone who can be so cruel and reveal herself as a liar is potentially capable of trying to turn things around on me and say that she left me because I hurt her or some other nonsense. I'd like to think she wouldn't do something like that, but who knows, especially after everything that has happened. Better safe than sorry.

I thought about just boxing up her stuff and breaking things off with no explanation. But it has been over 2 years together, I decided the best thing to do is to confront her calmly and then hear her out. If she had an explanation, I wanted to hear it, even if it didn't change my decision to break up with her. So I took her to a wine bar in downtown that has those little individual booths with half curtains. 

She's been sugary sweet since Monday. Which tells me she either a) felt guilty about what a jerk she was, b) thought I might have heard her, or c) she just knew I'd been acting distant and was totally clueless as to why. So she dressed up really nice and, despite everything that has happened, I can admit that she looked stunning. She was also very affectionate and kept making a lot of sexy comments about all the things she wanted to do to me later. Normally, my precious little baby carrot would have been thrilled by this, but given the circumstances, it was difficult to hear and act normal.

I had rehearsed what I was going to say to her over and over so as soon as we sat down and got our wine, I started. I can't remember word for word, my adrenaline was kicked in pretty high gear so it feels fuzzy. I basically started by saying how much I've loved her, how she's the only woman that I've ever felt connected to so profoundly that I opened myself up to her completely and trusted her. I told her that she's the only woman I've ever thought about marrying, that I've gone ring shopping for (I left out the part about how I already bought a ring), and that I've actually imagined having children with in the next few years. She kept interrupting me to say ""aw"" or to tell me how much she loves me, too.

Then I looked her in the eye and asked her point blank why, if she loved me so much, she horrendously made fun of me to Dylan. 

I have to say, the look on her face was a bit satisfying.

As expected, she denied at first and acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. She said Dylan knows how much she loves me and that she's never made fun of me to him. I kind of just looked at her and said something like ""come on, Jenna."" But she still denied even after I told her that I'd come home early on Monday and had heard her. 

It was pretty frustrating but I kept my cool. I just told her that she and I both know she's lying and that the things she said were unforgivable and that I couldn't wrap my mind around why she would say things like that to anyone, let alone Dylan, especially because she was lying just to be able to rag on me. 

Still denied and acted like I was crazy, she said she loves me so much, that she's not dissatisfied with our sex life and would never say she was or complain about my size, and that she knows how smart and sweet I am, that's why she loves me.

If I hadn't heard what she said to Dylan myself, I would have believed her. She deserves an Oscar for that performance. Some commenters asked if I was sure she was talking about me when I overheard her. When she was talking about her ex bf and his kraken of a dick, she said my name when she was making the comparison. I'm definitely sure that she was talking about me and that she was lying to my face about it.

I told her that I would drive us home and she could grab the essentials she needed and her dog. My brother and his girlfriend would be at the house, too. I wanted to make sure there were other people there just to have witnesses that I let her get her stuff and didn't do anything aggressive or destructive. I told her I'd pack the rest of her stuff up and leave it out for her to get whenever she could.

She was in total disbelief that I was actually breaking up with her. She pleaded with me but my mind was/is made up and I wasn't budging. It was hard not to cry in front of her though when she kept saying how much she wanted to be with me forever and that she had planned to be the mother of my children someday. 

I own my house and since Jenna hasn't helped with expenses by paying any rent or utilities, I wasn't too concerned about, putting it bluntly, kicking her out. She kept asking me what she was supposed to do and where was she supposed to sleep? I told her it wasn't really my problem anymore and that she has plenty of friends she can stay with until she gets her own place. Basically all of the furniture and decor is mine, she just has clothes/toiletries/etc. to get out. All of the ""redecorating"" she did to my house was done on my dime. 

Then came the waterworks. She started crying and saying that she didn't understand how I could do this to her. She said she thought I was a nice guy about a million times.

I told her I am a nice guy, which is why I didn't just throw her stuff on the front lawn, change the locks, and give her no explanation. 

Then, I swear to you, this woman dug the knife in even deeper. She said she didn't know why she said those things to Dylan (she finally acknowledged it!) and that maybe it's because Dylan brings out the best in her and she's able to laugh about things that would normally make her cry. I guess like my penis? 

I told her that it's really sad to me if what I heard was her at her best. It was petty and usually I'm above making snide comments, but I told her that she can go back to her hometown and go live with Dylan or her 9 inch dick ex boyfriend.

It was amazing to watch how fast those tears disappeared.

Apparently I am an asshole, I don't know how to treat women, I'm a loser, my penis is tiny, I'm going to be alone forever, she never really loved me and I was more like a friend but she didn't want to hurt me so she stayed with me (makes a lot of sense...?), she would have said no if I'd proposed, again, I am a loser and an asshole, and in case I didn't get it the first time, she meant it when she said my penis was a baby carrot. Oh, and I will die alone.

I told her dying alone is preferred to dying married to a woman who is cruel and doesn't love or respect me.

No joke, she started to scream. Not words, just a long, extremely loud scream. It was alarming and then she just booked it out of there after calling me a disgusting pig.

After paying the bill and apologizing to the waiter about the drama, I left and Jenna was just standing outside crying. I know what she did was horrible and all the things she said just a few minutes earlier were horrible, but... I still didn't like seeing her like that and didn't want to just leave her on the sidewalk. I'm in New England, it's already pretty cold here. So I told her to let me give her a ride back to the house so she could get her stuff but that she needed to leave and go stay somewhere else as soon as she packed a bag.

She agreed and we didn't talk at all in the car. Talk about an awkward ride. My brother and his wife were at the house when we got there. His wife stayed inside while Jenna got some stuff together and my brother waited outside with me.

That went by pretty uneventfully and she had a girlfriend come pick her up. I got my key back from her before she left. She texted me throughout the night and the texts ranged from sorry to sad to angry to really angry and back again. I didn't answer any of them and only texted her yesterday morning to tell her that her stuff was on the porch and that she should come pick it up while I'm at work.

I didn't hear from her all day until it was almost time for me to go home. Pretty nasty text wishing me about every ill you can wish a person. I didn't answer.

Well, I came home to a disaster zone. She smashed everything. I don't know if she had made a spare key at some point that I was unaware of or if she knows how to pick locks, but she got in to the house somehow and she destroyed it. She smashed stuff that's irreplaceable, she ripped up the furniture, she clogged two sinks and left the water running, she left my refrigerator open and threw food all over the kitchen. It was wrecked. The only considerate thing she did was lock my two dogs up in a bedroom, I guess so they didn't cut themselves on glass or eat the food.

I have two vehicles, one for everyday use and then an SUV for work. I use the SUV for when I make house calls and may have to bring a large or exotic animal into the vehicle to transport it to the clinic. In the middle of all the drama, I'd forgotten I'd given her a key to the SUV in case she ever had an emergency and needed to drive somewhere. I went out to check the car and she trashed the inside of it, too. She dumped flour all over the inside in addition to tomato soup. 

The stuff is just stuff, I suppose. It's more the fact that she could do something so childish and awful on top of everything else. It blows my mind. Last weekend I took her to a play, went out with her and friends, we played Monopoly one night and made up our own drinking game with it, we hung out and watched Netflix, made love several times. And this weekend my house and vehicle are destroyed and so am I. Amazing how fast things change.

Not my finest moment, but I was so pissed off that I got right on to Costco's instant delivery and ordered 20 5lb bags of baby carrots and had them shipped to her friend's place, addressed to Jenna. 100lbs of baby carrots. They deliver within an hour. I got a slew of interesting and insulting texts from her that evening. Yes, it was petty, but the only regret I have about it is that it was a waste of food. Hopefully she donates them or cooks some of them or something.

So, that's that. I blocked her last night after the nasty texts from her just kept coming. I'm feeling pretty beaten down right now and I've cried more than I have in a long time. It's obvious that I made the right choice; Jenna is clearly not emotionally stable or mature. She really is cruel and I know I do deserve better.

I have spent a lot of time since Monday thinking about myself as a partner and trying to figure out what could have led to her obviously having some resentment or something for me. I'm going to be 100% honest here. I work *a lot*. I try to still make time for the people I love and I try not to bring work home with me when I've had a bad day. But sometimes I do, I know this. Jenna and I have fought about it before and I have really tried to pace my days a certain way so that I can get home at a reasonable time and I've tried to leave bad days at work as much as I can. 

However, anyone who is a vet or has worked with one knows we're always on call for emergencies. Sometimes we have patients that we have to check on or stay with throughout the night. Time off can be challenging. It's doable, but it's challenging. My staff is incredible and can handle most situations, but I do still get a lot of calls or texts from them when I'm on vacation or off for the day.

I'm sure there have been times when Jenna felt second best to my job. Well, I guess I know there have been, she's told me as much in the past. I did try to make changes but there's only so much I can do. As far as I can remember, I've never been purposely mean to Jenna. I've had bad days and been grumpy or absent, we've had our share of disagreements and fights but nothing unhealthy or excessive. I really thought we had a solid relationship and that we were *both* happy. I know I was.

It's hard to not question myself and wonder if I really am a let down or if I neglected her to the point that she felt unloved enough to act the way she did. I don't know, but I do know that no matter what, the way she put me down and the way she reacted to breaking up was way, way out of line. I didn't deserve that and that's on her.

So thank you for rooting for me, Reddit. It's been great to read all the nice words and advice. Time for me and my baby carrot to eventually find a woman who appreciates us for what we are.

**tl;dr:** I broke up with Jenna Thursday night. Did not go well. She got nasty and ended up destroying my house, car, and me. But I did it, it's over, and I've blocked her from my phone/social media. I also sent her 100lbs of baby carrots in a moment of angry weakness.

Edit: I did file a police report and took pictures, which will hopefully help with recouping some of the money lost through insurance. As far as the police report, it's very doubtful anything will come of it since I can't prove it was her. Same goes for trying to sue her in small claims court. And honestly, I'd rather not deal with her anymore. I'm going to hope that insurance will cover the damages and just move on with my life.",relationship_advice
Why after breaking up with someone does it feels like the relationship never happend?,"My ex left my country to go back at home after 5 months of dating about 3 months ago, we broke up about 6 weeks ago after trying long distance.

I don't view her stories, I don't look at photos of her and we don't talk anywhere near as much as we used to. Obviously for me, it still hurts, but I guess it takes a while for me to get over things.

In relation to my question: I decided to have a look at her fb profile and have a look at her most recent photo... I stared at it in slight agony and thought, fuck this is weird. It's literally like she's a stranger and our relationship never really happend. She came into my life, had an intense rship with me and left as quickly as she entered. At one point we talked all the time, everyday and were in eachothers lives, now she is back home, we've both moved on and it's like she's a stranger again because we are on opposite sides of the world and only talk infrequently about on the surface stuff.

It's kinda sad but it is what it is. I've been struggling emotionally with the breakup, I don't think about her as much, only when I'm not busy and have time to think about it.

I suppose I am finding it hard to let go and move on. I guess that shit takes time.

Does anyone else find this?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who replied. I honestly had no idea how normal this was! It helped me put things into perspective and not feel as weird about her becoming a stranger. You're all lovely people! ",relationship_advice
My wife pressured me into becoming a father before I was ready. I stepped up. She admits after 2 years that she wasn't ready and threatens to leave almost daily.,"EDIT: Holy crap. I come back after putting the youngin' to bed for the night and you guys blew this post up! I've never gotten a response this grand before. Thank god the wife doesn't reddit. I'm going to make a stand... I'll start calling people and places to get her some medical help. If she isn't interested, that's it. If she is, and she works at it, she can stay. I love her, but the lifestyle has to change. I need her on my side or not at all. You guys are the bomb.
----------------------------------------------------------------

First, I love our son. He's the light of my life. I wasn't ready to be a father UNTIL I became one. Of course being a parent isn't easy, but I'm handling it the best I can. I love my wife too, but things are getting out of hand since the kiddo was born two years ago. When we got together she warned me she was bipolar. We've been together for 6 years... married for 2.

The real issue here. My wife pressured me into having him. I knew I wanted kids, and I knew I wanted kids with her, but I wasn't ready for us to have kids right then... I made a huge mistake and gave in. She kept saying ""I don't want to wait until I'm 35 to have kids. I want them now while I can, and if you don't, then we can't be together..."" I know I should have either left or given her the ultimatum that ""you wait until I'm ready or find someone who WILL give you kids right now"". I fucked up and I admit it, but I don't regret having him.

For the first few months I took off work... I held the baby, soothed the baby, changed the baby, fed the baby in the middle of the night. See, she was adamant about breastfeeding, and I agreed with it... I thought formula was insane and beyond expensive. I just didn't realize that when she said that feeding the baby was going to be her utmost care and responsibility that it was going to be her only responsibility.

 I went back to work when my leave was up. I didn't want to lose that job. She couldn't handle him on her own. I ended up calling out a few times or leaving work early to fix simple things like soothing the baby to sleep (i worked overnight so that I could be home all day and they would be asleep when I went)... I lost that job because she kept demanding I leave to come help her... I spent the next 3 months taking care of the baby.. everything except feeding him when she was awake. She only fed him when she was awake. We got evicted.

Fast forward a few weeks... We're living with roommates. I get a job. A better job than before. Shit's going well for a few months because she's got money to spend and my hours are reasonable. We don't have a car, so I walk 2 miles to work every day, and 2 miles home every evening. I still take the kid into my arms as soon as I hit the door, and I give her at least 2 hours to relax before I get to cool off from work. Things seem to be going fine.

Time passes. She's not fine. She demands I leave work early to come help her with the kid nearly daily. I put my foot down. ""Do what you have to do because that's what I'm doing."" She's mad as hell, and we argue constantly from then on. I end up hurting myself at work... I'm home for 2 weeks recovering. She's got me doing the full time dad thing again. I go back to work. She's becoming more stressed out dealing with the kid. She starts waking me up an hour or 3 each night to fight and to take the baby into another room because ""breastfeeding takes so much out of me"". The kid is over a year old now, so I say, ""you can stop breastfeeding him if it's that stressful.""... ""you don't understand. It's the only thing I'm good at"" (you mean it's the only thing you're willing to do.. but I don't say that) I eventually have a nervous breakdown and lose that job too.

Her father gives us a car because he thinks that my pedestrian commute is what is keeping me out of work despite me being a pedestrian my entire life, and never having lost a job due to attendance until now... So I get back to work... this time well out of walking distance because I've got a ride to work now... I spend all of a month there before I cant go because she can't take me. She needs me at home to help.

FINE. I'll be a stay-at-home-dad. You work. She finds a job and get's to it. The kid is almost 2 at this point. Can only say ""dada"". I start focusing on his talking. He's learning new words daily. He's walking by himself too. He's also getting a lot harder to take care of. The wife doesn't understand that though. She thinks he's got the same requirements despite eating solids, drinking from cups, and needing more space to be active. She thinks he's just as easy as he was when he was 6 months. So now when she gets home from a 4 hour shift serving food, I don't get a break... she goes and plays videogames. I haven't had more than half an hour to myself any given day since he was born, working 50-60 hour weeks in warehouses and walking 4 hours a day to get there and back... Suddenly she's overworked... somehow.... and requires several hours to unwind from a 4 hour workday.

Fast forward to recently:

She's so ""overworked"" that she quit her job. Now I'm stay-at-home-dad to the kid AND HER. My mom is paying our rent as we wait to move into a house she owns. I'm expected to find a job when we get there, but I don't know how I'm going to work and do all this shit. She plays games all day, and breastfeeds a toddler a couple of times a day and complains about it constantly. He can eat solids, and I cook for him constantly and give him snacks. Every time he wants her attention, he tries to pull her off her videogames and crawl into her lap. She groans and gets angry with me, ""why aren't you trying to entertain him?! Take him outside!"" I do... We're fighting constantly, and she defaults to self hating statements like, ""I'm a terrible parent and a terrible wife. I'm going to kill myself!"" or ""I should just leave, you two would be better off without me"" I'm so maddened by that ""better off"" comment but I try not to take the bait. Try to talk her down... She finally admits to me about two days ago ""Having him was a mistake, and I forced you into it."" I really didn't want to say I told her so, so I didn't....

What the fuck do I do? The kid needs his mother. There's a lot more to it. She CLAIMS to have PMDD, Post Partum Depression, Bipolar Disorder... she's only been diagnosed with Bipolar, and I've still never seen any papers on that.

TL;DR

31 year old dad is at the end of his rope. Wife admits kid was a mistake after pressuring me into getting her pregnant.

My (36F) husband (40M) has been accused of harassment.,"
I've been told to update here. Thank you everyone for all you did today. Here's my update.

The children are asleep and he is upstairs after one of the weirdest days of my life. Everyone will be ok but things are different than they were when I woke up this morning and asked the internet for advice.

Here are how things are different.

First, everything was settled with the complaint. All he knows is that a settlement was reached with her lawyers. He keeps his job. I was mislead about when the complaint was filed and what the timeline was. It was much further along than he said when he first told me. I'm still not sure what the sequence of events was because he was very sketchy, but there were weeks where he knew before he told me at least. During the investigation some problem with an expense report came up that was unrelated to the matter. He's going to have to pay some money to the company. This will come out of his share of the marital assets. I don't know if he did or didn't with this woman, but she is definitely hurting and I can't stand that.

Today I prayed on it, and I decided to ask one of the nannies. I messaged her and asked how she was doing. She's fine and happy. I asked this. ""I apologize for the abruptness, but I want to make sure the people in my life are ok. I have to ask. Did anyone, my family or friends, in my house ever make you feel uncomfortable or did anything inappropriate toward you? Please know I love you and nothing will change that."" The little three dots popped up immediately but then disappeared. This happened many times over the next hour. She responded and it was long. She said she didn't tell me because she didn't want break up what she thought was a perfect family. I was away with the kids at my parents. She helped us get in the car and get going. He had to stay back to work. He asked her to help with some organization and cleaning that I wanted done. He fixed himself a drink and offered her one. I won't go into the details except to say I know she is telling the truth that he and she had sex that night. She described generally what happened. There is a thing my husband likes to do that she described about how he started to have sex with her. I recognize the move from being married to him for thirteen years. I told her I loved her and that if she needed anything from me she would get it. I can't imagine what she is going through right now.

I texted the other former nanny. Same situation. I was away with the kids on some vacation. He was staying back for work. She said he made a move toward her and she rebuffed. Told her I loved her and that if she ever needed anything I would do it. I haven't asked the current nanny, but I will.

I've emailed a friend of a friend who is a divorce attorney. I'm tired, and I've cried inside a lot tonight. I'm thinking about what the future brings, but I think everything will be ok.

I won't check the old post anymore. I will check this one as I can. If you have any prayer requests, I'd love those. Either for you or for someone you know is hurting. If you do pray, keep my family and all the women in yours. If you don't, please send us love. Always be kind. Thanks.

Original Post:
We have been married for 13 years and have seven kids. I'm a stay at home mom with the kids. He works for a company and is relatively high up in the org chart. 

He has always been a loving husband and great dad. Our marriage has had the normal ups and downs and life is hectic in the house but we have a good marriage I believe. He's there for me emotionally and physically even though his job demands a lot from him. He's always there for the big events for the kids when he can and is wonderful with them. 

He came home recently and dropped a bombshell. A woman in his company has said he forced her into an affair for a promotion. He doesn't directly supervise her but she's in his department. He told me she's lying. I cried for a long time and we talked. He gave me his phone and email and I didn't see any correspondence with her. She said he made her get hotel rooms to have sex. I don't see anything in the bank account for the last three months that suggest anything weird. He says she has hotel receipts but nothing that ties him to it. He says she is pissed cause her salary negotiation was bad and she's pissed at what she got when she was promoted. 

I'm scared for my family and our future. I just use Reddit to talk to other SAHMs and for mommy advice. Never thought I'd be posting here. 

I believe him. I haven't seen him ever lie to me and he'd have no reason to step out cause he knows I'm here for his needs. There's no problem in the marriage I can see. It doesn't make any sense why he would try to have an affair with this woman.  She's attractive but not the type he normally thinks is attractive. 

But there is a seed of doubt because she went to HR and I don't think you make up something like this without any evidence or just to lie.

How can I be sure? How can I know or have more evidence that nothing will come of this? Please help.",relationship_advice
Caught wife cheating. Now what about her kids?,"TD;DR Caught straw cheating with ex. I have bonded with her kids, what to do with them.

Really long sorry. Had to get it out.
I(m52) lost 1st wife 10 years ago. At the time 2 daughters now 21 &24. Life went on after about 3 yrs. I met current wife(38). Met innocently enough. Basically kept bumping into her a various places around town. Never really talked, sometimes made eye contact we would point at each other at a distance and just smile. Then one day getting my car worked on, she walked into the waiting room, while hers was worked on also. So we finally had a long conversation. We went across the street to get real coffee, as service centers was bad. We talked about an hour, then I was paged mine was done. I asked if she would like to do lunch 1 day to continue talking, we exchanged numbers and a day to meet up.

We dated 2 years, then married. She has 2 boys now 10 and 14. They moved into my house, been living with her parents for 3 years. My girls loved her. Not as a step mom but as a big sister. Although having an another adult in the house with 2 teenage girls was a blessing.

Life is grand. I love those boys as if we're my own. I want to adopt them when they can make a decision on their own. The little one calls me dad. The oldest it was awkward, I told him to call me what he felt comfortable, my first name. The girls called her by her name. Wife is SAHM. We decided until kids were adjusted, now she doesn't want to work but does volunteer at school lunch and other things.

Daughter 1 goes off to college, is now graduated. The younger dughter grad this past morning. We are moving the rest of her things this weekend.

I was told her ex abandoned them about the time baby #2 came along and has been no contact since. Her mom is very nice but holds me at arms length. He is an Alpha Dog. I don't  think he wanted anyone else taking care of his daughter only child, and grandkids. He would berate me because I was too old ( not much younger than them). This would be anytime I was around them. I am nonconfrontational, so I told wife I would just stay away from them. I did encourage her to continue relationship, as they only live a couple blocks away.

February this year her ex reappears, wants to be in their lives. He us sketchy at best. I can not refuse this. He starts coming around often. I set a boundary  that he comes on weekends so as not to interfere with school and we can control his visitation somewhat. He comes most weekends, but really spends little time alone with the kids as we try to give him space .  I ask wife if he made any child support payments while he was gone. No. I suggested to her to talk to him about getting caught up of what ever he owes and to ask about signing over rights so I could adopt. She said she would talk to him.

 First part of March our sex life starts to dive. You know where this going, right? But I am oblivious. I mention to wife, she has the usual excuses. I notice little things around the house are different. My favorites snacks are gone, missing a few beers(not a big drinker just one every now and then). But the big one was I could smell what I thought was weed. I asked wife if she was smoking, as we don't, she hasn't. I thought the now 14 yr. old was, suggested we talk with him. She says she would handle it.

About 2 weeks ago 14 yr old asks me if I love mom. I said yes, thinking he has a girlfriend. Time for a talk right? He says that we always sat together and were touching each other some way or other, this made him feel good. He asks if mom loved his dad. I responded that sure on some level she does, why asking. He replies that they are always looking at each other, talking and touching. And he is over all the time. I asked what he meant by all the time, almost everyday when they get home from school he is there then leaves.

That weekend I 'm in the living room, he is over for visitation. He comes in and sits down across from me with a beer. I look up from my reading, and tell him to help himself to a beer. He says nothing. I ask why isn't  he with the kids I could hear laughing coming from the family room. He said he might go in a little bit. I tell him I will not drink in front of the kids, I wait until after they are in bed. He says nothing. He then states you know I am only here for her. What does that mean, your talking about my wife. He says technically not divorced he never signed papers, so she is his wife. I know a judge signed off on divorce because he could not be found, that's why it took longer to divorce.

I finally ask about the child support, since I never heard back. He just looked at me and said that he was caught up, paid her 15000 in cash. WTF. I asked then if she talked to him about giving up rights, never asked. He asked what would it be worth to me. I said you got to be kidding, you would sell your kids. Before he could answer I told him to leave. 

The next day, this past Sunday the kids were at grandma and grandpa with wife. I bought and installed a camera. I put it on top of the tv. Very small. It has a view of the front door and living room. Motion activated. Nothing unusal until Wednesday about 10 am. I get alert on phone when the camera activates. So I am at work I get a notice, figure it's the wife cleaning up, I look anyways. He comes back. She lets him in they kiss,long. He starts grabbing at her she playfully pushes away, they are laughing, no sound. He sits on the couch she brings him a beer and snacks. 10 am! She disappears. She is back a few minutes later, clothes changed, she is going to school for lunch. They are talking. More grabbing more pushing away, laughing. A few minutes later she is up getting ready to leave. He gets up grabs her again. Making some gestures, then poses like he is praying hands together. They sit down again the she gives him head. She finishes up, goes out of range. Comes back says something then leave. He then watches tv, the he takes a nap. Screen eventually go's blank.

A little after 1 pm another alert, she is home. They talk, they both leave room. I know they are headed to bedroom. I race home and find them. They never heard me coming. There is the hysterics you would expect. He slithers out. I tell her she has to go. She pleads it was a one time mistake he had just got there. She was lonely because we weren't having sex etc. I called Bs. I asked how often he came over, just the weekends. This was an anomaly.  I showed the video of him napping. She said he was tired and asked. Then I showed her the BJ. She had nothing to say. I told her to pack her bags she is out. I left and called her dad to take them in we were having issues. He of course take Alpha position, telling me how I would screw this up, yada yadda. I couldn't get a word in. Finally I stopped him, asked again he said yes, then started on me again. I had enough, I said I would send him something, I sent the video edited down to BJ. I told him to view and call me back if I was wrong. Never heard back.

Talked to lawyer Thursday. He helped with estate plan after first wife. Refered me to a partner who does family law will meet Tuesday divorce will happen. He felt but did not know for sure that I would be on the hook for support for kids, no alimony since she broke our prenup. I made it up before  marriage in addition to estate plan to protect my girls. I don't care about the support glad to do it. It's the boys. So my question or advice needed has anyone else been through divorce and was able to see their ex's kids even if they are no yours? How did that go?

So, we had a talk, and she still denies there is anything going on between them. I've said that I will not be a safety net, and that she has to choose. Does not look like she chose me. She didn't want to leave me, but she didn't want to cut him completely out of her life. She wouldn't even commit to telling him in front of me that they should keep it purely professional. She said that she had so many friends there and spouted some BS that she could only work there. So looks like I will have to get my ducks in a row. But thanks for all the helpful advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT: So, it looks like I will have to go through a mediation session with her and the state, since we have kids under the age of 16, then I can file for separation, before I can finalize the divorce after a year. That is Norwegian bureaucracy for you. I get the mediation part, seeing as you have to make sure the kids have a sense of normalcy through the process. But being married for a year after, feels like BS to me. It's not like I'm going to do a 180 and take her back after this. She's killed the trust and made me all but certain that she's also physical with him.",relationship_advice
"Me (36M) found out my wife (34F) has been cheating on me, don't know what to do","TL:DR: Wife slept with a married guy, kept talking to him afterwards, was also at the same time having an emotional and sexual relationship online with two foreign guys. We have 3 kids and a bad financial situation. Divorce is not an easy option and we both want to try to salvage the marriage but I don't know if I can.

  
Let me start with some backstory. We've been together for almost 17 years, have 3 kids an old house we've been slowly restoring over the last 2 years and our budget is not the greatest, no savings and lots of debt.

She's the only woman I've ever been with and before me, she had only a couple of one-night stands, so we were both little experienced when we met. She's been the light of my life and we've gone through some difficult times together and always have we been there for another. I thought we were one of the few who managed to stay on course no matter what. Apparently I was wrong.

With all that was going on, trying to fix the house, both working full time, trying to make ends meet and to make sure the kids are doing fine, we kinda lost ourselves. The bad financial situation and health related issues didn't help either. My wife had been trying to lose weight for a long time but nothing seemed to work for her and her self esteem was down to the floor. We were both depressed, but instead of talking and consoling one another, we suffered in silence. I buried my nose in computer games to hide from our problems while she had her nose in her phone all the time. This spring and summer, things started going worse. She was spending more time with her friends and going partying, while I stayed at home with the kids. I thought that if I let her „blow off some steam"" that she would come home in a better mood, but that didn't work at all.

I tried to ignore the bad feeling that was starting to sink in my stomach. I had heard a rumor that she had been seen kissing some dude at a dance in a nearby town. I confronted her about it, but she denied and said that the guy had tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away. I was not fully convinced, but didn't want to push her too much as I was trying to let her see that I trusted her. Yet as the summer passed, I noticed she was getting way more protective and secretive about her phone. After seing by chance what her FB password was one night in august 22nd, I decided to taka a look, to see if I could find anything about that dance earlier that summer. What I found was way worse.

I saw that indeed she had been kissing some dude drunk as hell until her friend pulled her out of it, but that's nothing compared to what I saw next. I accessed her Messenger and Skype.

I found out that she had been chatting online with two foreign guys, A and B, for months. It had started on Instagram, some random dude, A, sent her some flattering messages and she started talking to him on Skype after that in early June. After only speaking to him for less than two weeks she started sharing with him nude photos after only resisting a bit. The incident with the guy she kissed happened later that month. She was chatting with this guy A up until midst of August, when he showed his real intention, he was a scammer with a stolen account and was just sending her pictures from that stolen profile. Yet she had been fooled enough to share with him pictures of her most intimate parts. She seemed like she was falling in love with him. By then she was already started to talk to guy B, which also started on Instagram. Didn't take long for that to evolve to nude pictures and sexual talk. In both cases they were fantasizing about them coming to our country and meet with my wife at a hotel. She never spoke ill of me or anything like that, just talked about me like I was just there. If they asked, she said that I treated her well, but then she went on to tell them how she like to talk to them and they made her feel good. The worst is yet to come.

In one of the chats with a female friend of hers I found some more disturbing things. They went together to a 2 day town festival in another nearby town in early july, stayed at a rented room, which I of course had agreed to and thought would be ok, and I knew that my wife's friend who has trouble with panic attacks had needed to stay overnight at the local hospital. But what I didn't know and saw in that chat between them was that she mentioned a 41 year old guy from our own town (guy C), a married man with kids, who was unhappy in his relationship and she had met him that night. He had come over to chat and had tried to „go all the way"" but my wife told her friend that she had stopped him. She didn't mention the name, but I found out a likely suspect as our town is small and I also found in my online phone records that she had sent a message to a number belonging to a guy that fit the description. I feared the worst.

I didn't let my wife know what I had found yet, as I was afraid what would happen while the kids were around, so I put up a mask and waited until saturday 24th of august to confront my wife. I had called my mother and got her to take care of the kids. My wife is taking some classes to get some form of degree for her work and when she came home from class I asked her calmly to sit with me and I told her about what I knew. There was no violence, yelling or bad mouthing. Just two sad people, one of them angry and hurt, and we talked the whole night. She promised that nothing had happened between her and „C"" and what she had done online was only to try boosting her self esteem a bit as she thought I had stopped loving her. She didn't exactly try to blame me for it, nor did she yell at me for snooping around. She said she thought I didn't like her anymore because she wasn't losing weight and when those guys started raining compliments on her she said she got addicted. She said she didn't mean to hurt me, she was selfish and tried to please them as she could so they would keep complimenting her, therefore sending them nude pictures. She told me that she saw it now that she had been cheating on me but she hadn't realised it while she was doing it, even though she knew she was doing something wrong.

I wanted to believe her, I truly did. But I had concerns. We decided to try to fix our marriage and seek counseling. As the weeks passed, things seemed to be getting better. She's been way more affectionate to me and caring. Our sex life has been great and we've been spending way more time together than before. I still had a growing feeling in my stomach that she was hiding some critical information from me and after our second meeting with the marriage counselor last week, she finally admitted the truth. She admitted what I had suspected and feared but deeply hoped hadn't happened. She had indeed slept with C that night in july. And even though she said she had felt bad afterwards and shameful, she still kept talking to him via social media. She admitted to have met with him twice after that, but nothing more than a bit of kissing. She even tried to contact him again a few days after I had confronted her in august.

My first response after that was simply freezing. I didn't yell or curse or anything. I din't harm her in anyway. I partly felt relieved that she had finally admitted what I suspected, but at the same time I felt humiliated and hurt beyond anything I've ever felt before. I didn't want to rush to anything so I haven't thrown the ring in her face yet, nor have I confronted the other guy, as I don't want to be the person to rat on him to his wife or make myself get arrested for assault. Besides, it wasn't him that broke my marriage contract, it was my wife.

I don't know what to believe anymore. The woman I thought I knew would never do something like this. She's been trying to convince me that she was an idiot and selfish and whatnot and that she feels really bad about hurting me like that. She says she's ready to do anything to fix the situation and to get me to trust her again and feel like she's worthy again. 

Honestly I don't know if I'll ever trust her again or see her with the same eyes. I do love her of course and I like to be around her, and see her smile. But at the same time it stings my heart. I want this to work because of the kids and our shitty financial situation, as we can't afford going through divorce, but I fear that I will lose myself and never gain any self respect if I go through with this.

How the hell can I forgive her for cheating on me with not only one guy but three? Well, four, if you count that one time she kissed a random guy. She was both emotionally as well as physically cheating with all of them for some period of time. Not just a one drunk night mistake, but some kind of emotional and sexual relationship with three guys for over 2 months. Doesn't matter if two of those relationships were online. She still planned to meet with them, knowing fully what would happen if they did.

Has anyone here gone through anything similar to this and has some good advice? I know it's easy to say: „just divorce her man and move on"", but it's not that simple. I still have feelings for her and I don't know what will happen with our kids and our families. I also fear that if I dicorce her, which will mean that her family and friends will know the truth, that she will harm herself or at least be in a mental state where she will have bad influence on our kids. We also have an unfinished house and no savings and need at least to finish fixing it in order to get any cash out of selling it.",relationship_advice
"My [25F] boyfriend [29M] claims that he ""grew up in the Ghetto""","To start off, my boyfriend and I have been together 4 years but moved in together last year. Recently, he's taken to saying he grew up in the ""ghetto"" with blacks and mexicans. He's taken me to the area that he grew up in and called ghetto (north Phoenix), and to me, it seems like a perfectly nice neighborhood in comparison to where I grew up (south Chicago). He's also called the neighborhood we are living in now (in Phoenix) ghetto, too, even though it just seems like middle class apartments to me.

He uses his ""ghetto upbringing"" as a justification for saying ""n-gga"" with his friends as well as other things which he attributes to ""ghetto culture"", which bothers me. He's also made anti-Mexican jokes with his Hispanic friends, too. Now, neither of us are black, although we're both minorities (he's half white/half Vietnamese, I am Latina). 

I feel like he's just trying to claim an upbringing he didn't have to justify behaviors he knows he shouldn't do, and I don't know how to talk some sense in to him because he just laughs whenever I try to talk to him about it. 

Edit: Hey! Thanks people who are sending me PMs saying that I am an *uptight puta* who should *go back to Mexico* and that it is my fault that my *man* has started talking like this in the past year. I *totally* want *my ratchet ass friends* to come beat his ass. Yeah, I am some *skank* and my boyfriend should totally *dump my hoe ass.* 

If you can't tell, that's all sarcasm with some terms people have been PMing me. Thought it was kind of funny, in a horrible way.",relationship_advice

We face timed for about an hour, she cried a lot an explained that it was a one time I thing and how i should come home so we can discuss ""us"" i rejected her offer and said i need her to leave the house for awhile while I collect my thoughts and figure out what i wanted to do next.  She agreed ( not like she had a choice the home was given to me when my father pasted) 

I asked why she did this and why did she hide it from me.  She breaks down again explaining that it was a stupid mistake that she felt pressured to make and she's never spoken to the guy since. She offered me all her social media pass words and begged me not to leave her and try and work threw this. I didn't respond and she went on to explain how she didn't tell me because she didn't want a drunken slip up to destroy our life .

After some more awkward silence she tells me I can sleep with anyone woman and i shut that down and just said I need space. she's leaving the house tonight and I'm meeting with my brother in a couple hours to explain the situation to him.

I'm still not sure what I want to do but i understand that this isn't a decision should rush. I'm meeting with my lawyer tomorrow and plan on taking half the money from our joint accounts just to be safe.",relationship_advice
I'm the girl who got choked over shower temperature- here's my update.,"In my original post I told you all I was talking it through with him despite all of your advice. He did what you all said he would, apologizing, guilt tripping saying we should break up if I'm afraid of him etc. I went to work and he started texting me saying we need to move in together to which I said no. He said I have a year left to think about it because he's still on the lease. 

He took me out the following day for my birthday and paid for the whole day. It was nice. He kept counting outloud how much money he had spent on me- which sucked. After the day ended the honeymoon phase was over again. Back to normal with his moodiness and screamed at me when I asked him a question over his video game. His roommate looked at me like I was crazy. I looked away. 

I told my friends at work about what happened. They're all a lot older than me and reminded me of events that happened between us I forgot about. I've come to work one to many times with bruises and handprints, I must have blocked those memories out. I'm very alone. I don't have many friends, the one I do have moved to a different continent. 
 

I can't look at him like I used to. I know there's something wrong with me and I need to seek help for it. Even now, I'm nostalgic for my ex who cheated on me amongst other things. I need to work through why I attach myself to these men and why I can't value myself outside of a relationship with one. I'd like to thank everyone that commented, even if it was to call me crazy. I'm getting my things together slowly at his house. Thank you again.

Update: I'd like to add another update because I'm really upset.... I talked to my mom and she asked if I'm exaggerating because I'm ""more sensitive than others"". Now I'm worried I'm blowing things out of proportion. I hate feeling like I'm crazy. I have bipolar disorder but I don't think that has anything to do with this. I'm just very upset and don't wanna make rash decisions if I'm being insane.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant,"So I wanted to get this up as soon as possible because honestly, I never want to think about this again. I met with my ex this morning instead of after work because I guess neither of us could wait any longer to end this nightmare. I can't tell what's true and what isn't, all I know is my life has been pretty much torn to shreds. I went from confirming my pregnancy to this mess in basically no time at all, the last 24 hours have been the hardest of my life.

Before I get into the conversation I had with my ex, I wanted to clear up a couple points that people kept bringing up: yes, I've been to ""his"" house. I'll explain the quotations better. We both work a lot, and I never really minded never spending much time at his place. His story was that after his ""divorce"" he was left with the house to himself and he got some roommates, he was kinda touchy about the subject but we talked about it once and it had to do with feeling weird about having roommates in his 30s. He was allegedly in the process of selling the joke after his roommates left, so we stopped going there often since it was semi packed up. Made enough sense to me, and since I live alone I always preferred him being at my place anyway. So no, I didn't spend two years not knowing where my boyfriend lived, I spent a year and 7 months simply spending more time at my place together. 

The second point is how I got pregnant in the first place. We didn't plan for a baby, we didn't try for a baby. We simply decided that if it happened, it happened. He had this whole mentality about living in the moment and happy accidents and such, supposedly due to how his marriage ""ended"". So, I stopped using birth control and he would sometimes not use condoms. Come on guys, accidental pregnancies happen all the time. 

The last point is about my decision to terminate this pregnancy. I don't care about anyone else's stance on abortion, this is MY life and MY choice. For reasons that'll become clearer when I get to how my conversation with my ex went, this is the most painful and confusing thing I've ever dealt with. Yes I'd love to be a mother, but I'm in no rush. I know things rarely turn out as planned, but this is a terrible environment to bring a child into, and I'm not subjecting my child to the emotional turmoil I'm currently going through. I cannot have a healthy pregnancy with the state of mind I'm in right now, and I'd rather put this behind me and wait to raise a child with someone who truly loves me so they can have the life they deserve. It'd be selfish to have the baby just because it's what I want, I have to think about what's best for my future child, and this is not it. Since this all happened so quickly, it's literally been a day since the bomb dropped, I'll take some more time to think about it, but I think my stance is firm. 

Now onto what you all came for. 

I spoke to my ex first over the phone, and later outside of a coffee shop, I took y'all's advice to not be with him alone. I have no idea if any of what he told me was true, but I plan on never speaking to him again so it's the closest to the truth I'll ever get. His demeanor was very... odd. He looked almost close to tears but his tone and what he was saying was cold and emotionless and almost like he was debriefing me and not apologizing. 

Here is his story: his wife and him got married 10 years ago when she got pregnant, she was 18 at the time and her family is very Christian, so they married while she was pregnant and she eventually lost the child. Since then, he's felt trapped in his marriage but couldn't bring himself to leave as he describes his wife as a very sweet, innocent, and fragile person with very strong views on marriage and very high hopes for the relationship. 

After having their two kids, she became very focused on them and he started to stray from his marriage at this point. He claims that it wasn't until he met me that he realized just how dead his marriage was. Being the coward he is, instead of leaving his wife, he decided to just start another life with me, completely separately. 

This is where his lies started to get messy. He does have a job, but it turns out he works from home, so that's where he was when he was ""at the office"". His coworkers/work friends I met are kind of like partners, but their all independent and don't see each other too much, which is why he was okay introducing them to me, they had no idea about his wife. In hindsight I was very stupid to never think about meeting more of his friends, but neither of us are extremely social. While with me, he would tell his wife that he was out with clients, running errands, or on business trips, all things he did legitimately have to do for his job. 

The house I visited wasn't his, which is why there was no sign of children. It's his brother's house, he works out of town a lot so when I'd be over would be when my ex was housesitting. His story about moving in with roommates after his divorce? That's actually what happened to his brother, it was his brother that was in the process of selling his house after his roommates left, not him. So it turns out he does have family nearby. It gets more complicated, too much to type out, but his web of lies is very detailed, very well thought out, and unfortunately for everyone but him very well executed, somewhat through sheer dumb luck, but I'm 1000% sure he's had practice living a double life. 

This could all be lies, but this next part is the strangest to me. He claims that when we had the conversation to stop birth control and have kids, he had a different conversation with himself. He decided he was happier with me, and if a baby came along, that's when he would cut things off with his wife. But that makes no sense, would he be cutting off his children too? Was he planning on ever telling me? He said that when that moment came and he found out I am pregnant, he felt unexpected panic and reconsidered his life, and decided he couldn't leave his family. I guess that explains the confusion on his face when I told him. 

He then came to the conclusion that the best course of action would be to end things with me and ask me to get an abortion, and we'd be on our merry ways and he could go back to his normal life, he still thinks I have no way of knowing who his wife is and have no way of contacting her. NOPE. Though he doesn't need to worry about having a third kid, I cannot in good conscience let this man continue to lie to his wife, who sounds completely clueless. I took the advice of one of you and recorded the conversation on my phone. It's a garbage recording but there's just enough that's audible to keep as evidence. I'm going to spend some time compiling all I have and thinking of ways I could help her out of her disaster of a marriage, and then I will contact her. The reason I wanna help is because i feel I am playing a part in the ending of her marriage and I feel obligated to help if she'll allow me. I did not give him any indication that I'd be doing this. I told him I just wanted to never see him again and leave this in the past, which is true... but i want his wife to make the same decision. 

Im sorry for the novel of an update, thank you every one for your love and support. I missed so many red flags, about his friends, his family, his home, everything, but I was blindly in love and hindsight is 20/20. So much of this still doesn't make sense and never will, and a part of me believes that his explanations and confessions are fabricated and the truth is a lot messier, but I'll never know so i can't hold on to that. I'm considering moving to put this all behind me. Again, I wanna thank you guys so much for your input and guidance, my brain is still such a mess and it'll take a long time to heal, but you guys have helped me go towards the right direction.",relationship_advice
My [28M] wife [28F] exploded at me because of a dress that I bought her.,"Hi all.

Last week I bought my wife Beth (who is my childhood sweetheart) a beautiful designer red dress which at first she absolutely adored. She wore it on a date on Friday night and we had a great time. 

However, I came home from work today and found Beth in tears. She had ripped the dress in half and told me that she hated me for getting her *this* dress. I didn't understand but she soon explained everything. 

A long time ago back when we were in school Beth was bullied by a girl called Alice. I don't think ''bullied'' is even a strong enough word. It was truly horrific what that she was put through. A lot of Beth's friends turned against her and for a long time I was her only friend (though I'm ashamed to admit there was once a brief period when I believed Alice's lies and kept my distance). 

I think Beth is the most beautiful woman alive, but sadly she has always been convinced that Alice is prettier than her, especially since Alice told her every single day that she was ugly. 

Unfortunately Beth still has those insecurity issues. She looks Alice up occasionally and still believes that she will never be as beautiful as her (even though she's a million times more), and worse she thinks that Alice is doing better in life. Beth works as a pastry chef and loves her job, but (according to linkedin) Alice went to an elite university and is now a doctor. Even though Beth loves what she does she sees Alice as more successful than herself and feels like Alice will always get away with all the horrible things she did. 

Anyways back to the present. We have a lot of friends/followers on social media from our school days, which means that Alice and her friends often come up as ''people to follow''. Unfortunately Alice came up on Beth's instagram and she couldn't resist having a look at her profile. 

Beth found a picture of Alice at some kind of party and she was clearly wearing the same dress that I had bought Beth. Bear in mind that this happened when I wasn't at home, so by the time I got home Beth had become convinced that I had seen Alice's picture and thought she was beautiful, which is why I bought the dress. She accused me of only complimenting her because she was in Alice's dress.

I swear that I had no idea that Alice had the same dress, but Beth accused me of ''wanting'' Alice. I understand where these insecurities come from. A fair few of Beth's friends ditched her to become friends with Alice and those abandonment issues have stuck around unfortunately. Beth's parents also have mental health issues and while they loved her, they were often very emotionally distant when she was a child so she often feels very unloved and at times becomes convinced that I no longer love her and will leave her. 

I tried to assure her that I hate Alice, because I do. I honestly have never hated anyone as much as that woman and wish her nothing but misery and hurt. I tried to hug Beth and tell her that I loved her, that I didn't know that Alice had the same dress, and even suggested that we burn the dress if it makes her happy. But Beth just told me to stay away from her. She is sleeping on the sofa tonight and is still downstairs crying at the moment. 

How do I make this better for her? 

tl;dr: I unknowingly bought my wife the same dress that was worn by the girl who severely bullied her at school, and she thinks that it was deliberate and that I want the bully.",relationship_advice
OMG - My wife hates me,"I'm totally at a loss for words.  Once again, my wife chose not to get me anything for my birthday - nothing.  We've been married for 27 years and I never forget her birthday.  And her gifts always cost me an arm and a leg - she has expensive tastes.  I always look forward to my birthday hoping that she actually goes out of her way and does something.  The last two years have been horrible.  So much so that I've been thinking of calling it quits after all this time.  My thinking goes as follows - if I'm not important enough for you to go out of your way and actually do something nice for me, why continue this farce?

&#x200B;

What got me this year was the excuse she used. I had relatives in town and took them out over the weekend.  This left her alone to do whatever she wanted. She had an eyelash appointment on Friday and a nail appointment on Saturday.  Sunday came around and my relative had an accident that necessitated a trip to the ER that evening. She decided to go to the ER for a completely unrelated issue.  On Monday, she told me happy birthday but she didn't get me anything because everyone was too busy on Sunday. Seriously? What happened to the other 364 days she could have prepared for it? And what happened to actually making an effort on Friday or Saturday?  I was pissed - not sure if she could tell.

&#x200B;

To make matters worse, on Monday she went out to a clothing store to buy new clothes.  I asked her for a simple gift card - she blew that off.  And next week she has surgery that isn't covered by insurance that I'm expected to pay.  I'm sure Father's Day will be more of the same.  I got her expensive tickets for her Mother's Day gift to see a concert in CA.  I'm already sure I'll get absolutely nothing.  It's just after all these years of giving, I'm done - this has sucked everything out of me. And I could do nothing for her special days, but then I'm riddled with guilt by her to no end.

"[UPDATE] My (23F) husband (36M) will only eat ""kiddie food"" and it's ruining our relationship.","Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnyk5r/my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie_food_and/). 

**TLDR**; my husband only eats three extremely unhealthy foods and refuses to even touch anything else.

So, I did it.

I confronted him when he came home.

I brought up ARFID, which he seemed very open to. He seemed sort of relieved that it's a fairly common disorder— some of you absolutely called it, he explained that he was extremely embarrassed and defensive when I had tried bringing the issue up with him before. When I explained how much it hurt when he shut me down he seemed genuinely surprised. He had no idea this issue was so important to me. I'll admit, I did cry a bit as I told him how worried I am about him eating himself into an early grave. His foods are NOT healthy, and by the end of our conversation we both agreed to work together to overcome this.

We'll be going to couple's therapy this weekend at a local clinic. From there we'll look into seeing a dietician and a specialized counselor for his eating disorder. 

**However**

I called his mother while he was at work. I asked her about his eating habits as a kid, if there was any foods he sort of liked or anything he was really adverse to. I like the idea of making weekly meal prep together, so there's no surprises and we can collaborate on slowly introducing new foods. I was hoping this conversation would give me a good starting point when I talked with him. 

His mother is a very sweet woman and told me all the foods he even sort of would eat, and everything he refused to. But she offhand mentioned that he has sensory processing issues due to his autism. 

I asked her to elaborate and she did. It turns out he was diagnosed with autism as a kid. He even went to an after-school physical therapist for many years to deal with sensory issues.

He never told me any of this. When I spoke with him I didn't know how to bring it up, so I just didn't. I'm so worried he'll deny it, or he'll get angry with me for speaking to his mother behind his back, since he obviously doesn't want me to know.

I want to stress that I never brought up autism with his mother. She mentioned it all on her own.

I feel lied to and manipulated. I don't know how to bring it up with him, because right now I'm just starting to process it. I'm angry that he never told me. His food issues are one thing, but not telling me about his autism (and seemingly intentionally keeping it from me, as he didn't bother to mention it today either) is another.

It's more and more obvious that the man I married isn't who I think he is and has been lying to me for years. Right now I'm telling myself to wait until counseling this weekend before confronting him. I don't want our conversation to be out of anger. But I also don't know how I could ever trust him again if he was so willing to keep such a big secret from me.

**TLDR 2**; I spoke with my husband's mother, who told me that he was diagnosed with autism as a child in a way that suggests she clearly thought I already knew. I confronted my husband about his eating but not the autism thing, and he was extremely willing to cooperate and seek counseling. I'm mad about being lied to about the autism thing.

EDIT: I will be bringing this up in counseling but I'm not going to discuss it with him until then as I don't want to let my anger and hurt override my desire to help him. As some people stated it is possible he doesn't know about his autism; I really, really, really hope that is the case. I'm hurt not because he has autism (I really couldn't care less, it doesn't change who he is as a person) but rather that he never told me about it.",relationship_advice
I (24M) am thinking about breaking off the engagement to my fiancee (24F) who has let herself go.,"Fiancee (24F) and I (24M) have been together for the last 7 years. When we first started dating (senior year of high school), we were both fit. At the time, I was 6'2"", 190 and she was 5'5"", 155. 

By college graduation, I was 6'3"", 205 and when she graduated she was 5'6"", 230. This was in December of 2017.

I know people are extremely sensitive about weight and I know I'm going to get all the comments calling me a pig, a loser, etc., etc. But physical attraction is huge in any relationship and it's beginning to affect mine.

Anyways, I still was in love with who my fiancee was as a person and I was still confident that she was going to get her weight under control. So last September I proposed to her. Our wedding date is set for January, 2020. But now I think proposing might have been a mistake... 

Around December of last year, I began to second-guess my decision. She hasn't lost any weight from the time she graduated (still 230) and she's really lazy and unmotivated to work out or diet. We've had 4 huge arguments about her weight since the engagement (with probably 5 more before we got engaged as well). After each argument I think I've finally got through to her, but the weight stays on or gets worse. 

Over the last several months it's got to the point where it's almost hard to look at her because her now pronounced double chin and gut are just so unattractive to me. And this really, really, really scares me. It also makes me feel like I'm some judgmental piece of shit. Here is this woman who has given me all of her love and who I've spent 7 long years with, and I'm picking her apart with my eyes every day. It hurts to lose physical attraction like that with the one you love. It's an awful, nagging, self-hating feeling that I feel each day. But I feel trapped. I can't escape this feeling that I'm no longer attracted to her. I wish I could just see past the weight gain, but I just can't anymore. And I've made it 100x worse by proposing to her. I've made our relationship that much more public and it kills me to think of how publicly embarrassing it would be for her if I called off our engagement. 

It's like half of me is like ""You idiot, LEAVE NOW, before it becomes legal and that much more messy. You aren't attracted to her anymore and it's not going to get better."" 

Whereas, the other half of me is thinking ""She's such a loving, caring woman, who you've spent so many great years with. Can't you just be happy with her? Plus, do you really want to set off the social atom bomb that is calling off the wedding?""

We have 7 1/2 months until our wedding so if I'm going to do this, I know I NEED to do it soon. I wouldn't want to call it off any later than 6 months prior to the wedding (July). 

Please help me get my mind on straight Reddit.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] Trying to make my [M29] fiancé [27F] (somewhat) with me not fighting cancer that will mean losing my penis,"Original Post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0qxle/trying_to_make_my29m_fianc%C3%A9_27f_somewhat_okay/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

So rather than respond to hundreds of comments I thought I'd respond to most of the more prevalent ideas, questions, and suggestions and provide an update to my situation.

First off I talked a lot more with my fiancé. At first I told her that my mind was no longer set in stone and that I would try but I would need her to be open and honest with me through everything and not say things to just make me feel better throughout everything. I had a second opinion today and I asked her to come with me and she did and the oncologist said externally my penis matches my initial doctor's findings but that he was going to give me a battery of tests and see what could be done to preserve my sense of self and as much penis as possible if at all possible which he stressed would be none if my original doctor's findings were correct.

I broke down in the car and begged her for her forgiveness that my initial instinct was to just die. I told her that knowing that even if I stay alive knowing I hurt her in such a deep way by wanting to die over living as a man without a penis would hurt me just as much as losing my member. I just want her to not feel different about me. That's pretty much what this is all about. I don't want her to pity me or stay in an unhappy relationship over leaving me just because I am what I'm going to become.

  I showed her what everyone was saying to me on here and how most agreed with her and she just burst into tears that so many people could speak to me the way they did. I told her if she wants me to I will have the procedure and she said she doesn't want me to live if I don't want to. I told her I wanted to see everything she becomes even if I fall apart. She promised to take care of me and that nothing had to change as long as I was committed to her, the relationship, and living. I told her I was more afraid of wanting to get over it and not being able to so I drive her away.

A lot of people are acting like this is not a big deal. One DM I got told me that she having to read what I wrote was harder for her than me having to lose my penis. I realize going to the internet for advice was probably a mistake after that. Another girl said if I was worried about sexual urges after losing my penis I should lose my testicles too and they were 100% serious. Others advised sex change. I don't think they realize how deeply hurting they were although it may have been on purpose.

The future

I'm taking it as a process and telling her everything. I am deeply ashamed of how I felt even though I really still feel that I don't want to live like that. I do want her to be happy though and if that means living as a life I don't want so she never has to deal with the pain of being alone. I want to ask her to elope so we can have the wedding night I initially planned but I don't know if that's fair to ask given how much she knows I'm in pain and might feel pressured to get married even if she doesn't want to. I would still have a big wedding later if she wanted. 

We will be seeking couple's therapy and individual therapy. I have an appointment tomorrow due to the emergency of my situation I was able to get in quickly. 

I am very afraid. Afraid of the loss. Afraid of how it will change my relationship and sense of self.

To most of the most common responses 

&amp;gt;it's no big deal/just chop it off

I am very insecure about this and how it will effect me.  All the things you don't even think about will have a deeply wounding impact on me. I will lose intercourse with the woman who means the world to me, I won't be able to pee standing up, I will be afraid to watch comedy movies because 90% have a dick joke somewhere either about small dicks or no dicks and it will make me cry, I'm not going to watch the last season of game of thrones because of the various characters who don't have penises and will probably cry and it doesn't feel right asking her not to watch and I know everytime one of those characters show up she will think about me, I am constantly aware of my penis and will constantly be aware of it's absence, I won't be able to go the gym or use a locker room, I won't be able to hang out with guy friends talking about their sexual exploits, every guy who hits on my fiancé (which is a lot and I've always taken it in stride) will make feel inferior and afraid to stick up for myself,  I will not be the person I am now. I will be constantly paranoid about people finding out and constantly paranoid about not being enough for my fiancé or that my mental and emotional problems during my recovery would drive her away. Dying seemed better than her leaving me. Yes she's perfect but I am not.

&amp;gt; you're being selfish

I am. 100%. I never denied that in my post. Now that I've changed my mind or at least am more open to it I feel like maybe I can live for her and when and if she's done with me I can still live for her so she doesn't have to have my death on her conscious.

&amp;gt; you can always kill your self later

No I can't. I won't do that to her.

&amp;gt; use your mouth, finger, toys etc

Yeah I know that but it's not the same and it will never be again.

&gt; get therapy

We and I are both getting therapy and I think she is too.

&gt; you don't deserve her

I know that and I'll feel even worse about that after this. I will feel guilty forever that I told her I was going to die instead of try for her.

&amp;gt; get prostate massages to orgasm don't be afraid to stick things up your butt etc

I'm not afraid of that, if she had ever wanted that we'd be doing it already because I want her to be happy

&gt; get a phalloplasty

I will be dealing with a lot of medical bills and this seems like it will be considered an elective procedure and potentially not covered.

&gt; get a plaster dildo made from your dick

Yeah, the reminder would probably hurt.

&gt; she loves you and that's more important than anything

Yes I know that. I'm afraid she won't anymore after I change physically and emotionally. I'm also afraid she'll be disgusted by my appearance. I know I should take her at her word but I'm going to deal with major emotional issues for a very long time and I'm not even sure it's fair to ask her to go through that with me.

> no one has to know/it's not a big deal if someone knows

I was bullied so bad as a kid my mom had to pull me out of school. I thought I was over that but this feeling over not being part of the herd because of my disability is bringing all of that back. I feel like a total outcast who will be not a full man and not worthy of a woman. I would not be able to handle a single joke or comment, I couldn't handle the idea of people talking about me behind my back joking about me. I have discussed my fear and paranoia with my fiancé and she's promised to be honest with me but also not share with anyone unless I ever do feel able to share.

> what about your family and friends

My family and I haven't been close since I went to college 11 years ago. We are not on bad terms but it's a see you at Christmas sort of deal. I don't know I want to have friends anymore.

In closing

I am in more pain now than when I thought I accepted death but I want her to know how special she is. I'm very afraid that I may have wounded our relationship too much by wanting to die. The responses I got hurt me a lot but some were very helpful even though they were against my initial thoughts but were empathic. I just want to be the person I am now because I know she loves that person. I know that is not an option but I don't know she will love the new me. The thought of her with someone else after me and him being able to please her in a way I can't hurts a lot more than I can handle and knowing that we probably would've had the perfect life before my diagnosis makes it hurt even more. I will do this for her because she deserves everything I can give her and more but I don't know if that will be enough. 

I love you Megan if you read this. Please forgive me. Nothing in life means more to me than you. I want to spend my life with you whatever that means in whatever way I can.

Edit: I appreciate the support I'm getting and I intend to get back to all the kind people I can but I'm kind of overwhelmed right now. I'm also starting to realize the financial impact this will have and my plans to elope are not in her best interest if she ends up with my medical debt. 

Also to the people that were absolutely horrible to me yesterday and now want to play nice and say how proud they are go to hell. This is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. I also know if she was posting ""my man has cancer and is losing his dick should I stay?"" you would all tell her to leave before I became her emotionally damaged burden for the rest of her life.

Edit 2: my inbox has exploded. If I didn't get back to you and you had supportive words I will respond in time.

I made love tonight for what will be one of the last few times at least in the way I currently experience it.  It was only after seeing that she looked at me the same way during that I felt even a little bit okay. She is happy with eloping and I tried to make it clear she didn't have to and that if she wanted to postpone to see what I'm like after I would understand. She just told me she wanted our wedding night to be everything we dreamed of.

I'm sorry if I've come across as a basket case. 

I did look for a support group online and ended up finding a marriage board talking about life post penectomy. One wife said she thought it was great because he has no drive anymore after constantly being on her for sex and she knows he'll never have an affair. That really fucked me up. She's saying she's the only one that would have him and that his loss of penis means she doesn't have to have sex unless she is initiating. I know Megan's not like that but that she could be so callous about her husband's suffering made me feel very insecure.

Edit 3: I appreciate those who offered support and understanding either for my initial reaction or my newer one even if they didn't agree with them. I woke up to many more responses than I would ever expect  and I feel like I can't respond to all of you and also go about my day. Just know I appreciate the support. I will try to respond to certain replies as I can but if I don't get to you know that I still appreciate what you said. I haven't gone to work in a couple days so I am semi-available but right now I'm working on a getting a third opinion while also waiting on a response from the second opinion. I also have my first appointment with a therapist today and we'll see how that goes. I will likely post updates as a way of mass response because a lot of these statements and questions are the similar formations of the same idea even though I appreciate all the ones who are supporting me. My fiancé also skipped work today too and we've been talking a lot about our new expectations for our lives together which need to be changed from the pre-diagnosis plan. I've put my faith in her commitment even though I know a lot of things will change.

Edit 5: My recent update was taken down because I guess this isn't the place to discuss my issues. I appreciate all the help. If I do continue to updates I don't know where I should go if people want them. 

Edit 6: I put an update on my profile since I don't think they want me to post here anymore.",relationship_advice
(UPDATE) My (21F) boyfriend (22M) of two years changed his phone background to another girl. I asked him about it and he told me to get plastic surgery.,"Life really is an absolute fucking adventure.

Thank you for all your messages. I'm on mobile and idk how to link to my previous post, but basically: I unplugged the charger from my boyfriend's phone while he was showering so that I could charge my phone. His screen lit up when I did this & revealed his lockscreen was him holding a female friend (lets call her Lucy). He chose this friend's birthday over mine (I didn't blame him because he would have needed to drive an hour to see me) & is frequently ""liking"" inappropriate pics of her.

So. Here's the update. 

He came out of the shower and immediately made a beeline for his phone. When he noticed I had unplugged it, he immediately asked why. I responded honestly and said that I had wanted to charge my phone. I then decided to what everyone suggested - I asked him about his background. I wasn't aggressive or anything, I literally just said ""so I noticed I'm not your background anymore"" in a playful tone, just like how he talks to me when I change mine.

He asked if that was a problem, and I said no, but I didn't want the conversation to end like that. So I asked him why he chose that photo. He didn't like this question. He didn't raise his voice, he just looked at me funny and asked what I meant. Then he asked me if I was jealous of the girl in the pic. I said no, I was just surprised because I didn't realise they were that close. He asked me if i went through his phone and I said no.

This whole time he was being so calm and nice and he really didn't seem at all angry. He's always lovely to me and he was being SO good about this. He's always lovely to me, he really is and I mean that, but his question about me going through his phone worried me a little because why would he need to ask me that?? But even though he remained super calm, he asked me again if I went through his phone and he just kept asking. It was like

Him: Did you go through my phone?
Me: No
Him: Are you sure?
Me: Yes
Him: Do you promise?
Me: Yes I promise 

And then he said that it would be a dealbreaker if he did ever find out that I had been snooping. I hadn't snooped and would never snoop, and I told him that. He just kissed me on the forehead and took his phone and basically just started messaging someone and watching stuff on his laptop, so the conversation was clearly over for him.

I didn't know what to say or do at this point because I was just feeling really guilty but I was also concerned that he thought I wasn't trustworthy and I felt bad for bringing up the photo. I was really quiet but just watched YouTube with him for a bit. Usually he gets pretty handsy with me when we watch stuff together, and he did this time too but I wasn't really feeling it so I declined his advances. He kept trying and was playfully saying things like ""don't be so sulky"" and when I said I wasn't sulking and that I just wasn't in the mood, he said ""this is because of Lucy isn't it?"". He still had the playful voice but it really surprised me and I felt embarrassed and guilty and annoyed. I don't remember what I said but I think I denied it being due to her. 

He stopped touching me and sighed then told me that he thought I was being too jealous and insecure lately and that I was projecting all my feelings onto Lucy??? He didn't shout or anything and he seemed more disappointed/concerned than mad but it was just SO much and I'm still really confused by it. I have never been a jealous person, but its true that I can be insecure sometimes. I don't feel good about my breast size and I don't feel good enough for my boyfriend because hes so amazing and so attractive. I've never ever let that affect anything though, and this is truly the best and most healthy relationship I've ever been in & we never ever have conflict.

I apologised and said I didn't mean to project and I asked him what he meant by that. He said that it's obvious that my insecurity about my body is having a bad effect on me and is making me jealous of girls with better bodies. He then proceeded to unlock his phone and go to Lucy's Instagram and scroll through, showing me all the photos of her in various bikinis and cosplays etc while asking me if I felt jealous. At this point I started to cry and I'm still embarrassed by that. I wasn't crying out of jealousy, I just couldn't understand what was going on and I was SO embarrassed. My bf didn't get angry or anything, he just hugged me and said ""see? you're too insecure."" Then he began talking about how I should get a boobjob. He's mentioned this several times over the past few days, since I asked him if he found my breast size attractive and he said no. 

I told him I don't want surgery. He knows this. But he said its the only way I'm going to stop being insecure and that I'm just going to resent other women if I don't change. He started showing me photos of women who had gotten breast implants and saying stuff like ""look how happy she is"" and ""look, this girl's even bigger than Lucy"" but i just felt miserable. I still do. Of all the things to say to me, why say this? Why show me this shit when I've said I don't want surgery??? He wasn't being mean, but that shit really still stings.

I told him that I'm really not projecting onto Lucy at all and that I didn't care about her breast size, and I told him that I only mentioned his lockscreen because he always complains when mine isn't a photo of him/us. I was pretty distressed at this point. He wasn't really responding, just sorta looking at me. It was frustrating. Then I asked why he went to her birthday instead of mine. I was pretty worked up at this point so I just sort of blurted it out. 

His response baffled me so much that I stopped crying because I was so confused. I'm still confused. He said that he didn't go to her party and that he went to mine. Literally all I could say was ""what"" and he said that he wouldn't have done that & that I was just remembering wrong. I am not remembering wrong! I remember it perfectly and I remember us even talking on the phone that night! We've had conversations about him going to her party. I know some of the people he went with. It literally happened. But he said it didn't, while being completely calm and sincere. He said I must've been too drunk to remember the night properly but that's ridiculous and it's not remotely true! He kept saying ""don't you remember"" and then telling me things that literally didn't happen that night but he was SO sure and now I'm doubting myself so much. My birthday was very recently as well so I don't know why I'm struggling to remember.

I'm just so confused. He was certain. He's not a liar and he's never lied to me about anything before, but also its just such a bizarre thing to lie about. He was dead serious though, it was so weird. He changed the subject back to my breast size and I just walked out to the bathroom because I needed a breather. When I came back he was watching Doom Patrol and acting as if nothing happened. 

I got into bed and tried to sleep. This morning he was gone when I woke up and we've spoken a lot less today because I don't know what to say to him. I feel so confused and everything is just so bizarre right now. I don't understand what happened and I feel like I'm being crazy. I don't know what to do. I rang him a few hours ago and apologised for everything and he reassured me and said that ""we'll sort out [my] body so [I] can stop being so paranoid"". I wanted to ask about the birthday thing again because it was just so weird but I didn't know what to say so I left it alone.

Am I just paranoid? What should I do? I feel like I can't trust my own thoughts right now and I'm just so fucking lost. I don't want to lose him.

Edit: The reaction to this has really blown me away. I am reading as many of the comments as I can and I AM taking all your words on board. Thank you to each and every person who has taken the time to give me advice, and sorry if I haven't replied. There's a lot for me to deal with right now and I'm very emotionally exhausted. I'd also like it if people could stop calling me an idiot, stupid, etc. You don't know what it's like to not be able to trust your own thoughts and feelings due to the behaviour of a master manipulator.",relationship_advice
"Three weeks ago my wife (32/f) of ten years left me (43/m) out of the blue, found out a week later it was for another man.","**Wife is 32 I am 34, typo in title** 

We've been married for eight years, together for ten. Eight years ago, about five months after our wedding my wife left me for another man, we were separated for five months but never got a divorce, she then came back asking for a 2nd chance and I gave it to her. The last 8 years were immensely better than the previous two. We had a stronger relationship than ever, for 8 years we never fought, never argued and only on the rarest of instances (maybe like 5 times in 8 years) raised our voices to each other. 

She was the perfect little wife, she loved to cook/bake and spoiled me, all my friends were jealous of how much my wife does for me, and I made it perfectly clear to her every single day how much I appreciate all she does for me, how much I love her and we would bask in how much better our relationship seemed than everyone else's. 

I signed up for nursing school 6 months ago, the school is in a city 150 miles away. I'd still be home 3-4 nights a week but I'd be up in school for a big chunk of every week for two years. I didn't make this decision without her, we discussed it a lot and she was super supportive and we were both excited about the kind of pay I'd be earning when I graduate. We could finally get a nice house, finally go on nice vacations every year instead of once every few years. 

We have both put on a lot of weight over the last decade, we both really let ourselves go, food was a real comfort in life for us and she loved to cook and bake treats (shes a professional baker.) We have both tried and failed dozens of times to lose the weight, always falling back into our bad habits after a couple of months. 

4 months ago we started again, it was going really well until I had a surprise medical emergency and needed surgery that had me laid up for a couple months, I was in serve pain all the time but she was wonderful the whole time. I went back to my bad eating habits out of need of comfort but she stayed true to the course (or so I thought) and continued to lose weight. I was so proud of her and while she did have a lot of sagging and loose skin issues I couldn't have cared less. I love this woman with my entire heart and soul, I didn't care if she weighed 120lbs or 400lbs her mind and her heart were all that mattered to me. 

In the back of your mind, when a spouse starts to lose weight and you don't you always get a small tingle of fear of ""what could happen"" but I never let that get to me, after all she had made that mistake 8 years ago and really truly regretted it, so I assumed she learned her lesson and it would never be an issue again. Oh how wrong I was. 

She ended up losing 75lbs (needed to lose 90 to get to her goal weight) and was looking so good. I guess that's when the attention from male customers at work started to flow in. 

I had one more surgery planned for July 21st, it was just to finish up the first one, the recovery and pain was supposed to be nothing like before (and it wasn't I feel great now concerning the surgery area) 

We went on a overnight road trip on June 29th and it was fantastic, we made some of the best love we had made in months after that trip. Everything seemed perfect.

July 4th was the start of the weirdness tho. I noticed all of a sudden she started getting distant, wouldn't reply to text nearly as often as she had before, didn't kiss me hard like she would before, would just kind of drape her arms on me in bed or when we hug instead of the tight squeezes I am accustomed to. 

I asked if everything was ok, mentioned the changes I have noticed and she assured me things were fine, that work had just been really stressful lately and it was getting to her (which is true, her job has been nuts lately) and that she would try to get back into our old groove. 

Nothing changed, if anything the text started coming less frequently, the kisses left often, she would sleep on the other side of the bed instead of snuggled up next to me like she always did. Something was definitely wrong. 

I decided I was going to be the best husband I could be, I started doing all the choirs so she had none, I did all the cooking or got take out so she had less stress when she got home from work, I went out and picked a huge set of wild flowers, the same ones I picked for her on our honeymoon. I wrote page long love letters that I wrote from the heart (no fake romantic bs.)

All of this fell on deaf ears, I had snuck out after she fell asleep to do the flower/note thing. I assumed when she got up for work she would come back in the bedroom and wake me up. She didn't... she didn't even text me about them. Finally I sent her a text asking how work was going, assuming she would then tell me about how much she liked the flowers and note. Nothing. I finally asked her if she saw them/read the note and she said ""yeah that was sweet of you."" I knew something was wrong now but you really want to live in denial when this kind of thing is happening. The next night I asked for her cell phone just to transfer some photos to it and I could see her deleting a bunch of text before she handed it to me (i wouldn't have even checked her text) she also started spending way more time on her phone than she ever had before. Alarm bells were ringing like crazy. 

My birthday came up and she made me my favorite meal but we were both too tired from work and such for sex that night. The next day I tried to get something going in the bed and for the first time in our relationship she couldn't get in the mood after I had started all the old reliable go to's. She was even closing her legs while I was trying to get her going, something she had never done. She apologized and said shes just stressed from work and we both went to sleep.

5 days later I told her I was going to go see a friend but really I just went to the near by beach to think about what I should do. I decided there that if she wants out of our marriage I'll let her out. I came home and she was just getting out of the shower. I finally confessed all the fears I'd been feeling right there in the bathroom, and with tears streaming down my face I told her if she wants out of our marriage I'll let her go because I love her too much to keep her some place she won't be happy. She was crying too and told me no, she wanted to stay and felt bad that her actions were making me feel this way and fearing so much for our marriage. 

Things were kind of normal the next day but you could tell something was still off. That night she slept with a blanket dam between us.

The next morning I set her some lovey dovey text and she never replied, I checked facebook messenger a few times and she was constantly being active on there, which meant she was ignoring my text. I called her at work to see how her day is going and all that and then asked why it felt like she was ignoring me, she said she was just busy. My surgery was the next day and we were supposed to leave that evening for a nice date night and a surprise I had planned for her along the way. I assumed things would get better after that and just let it go. 

About an hour later I get a huge text about how she's sorry but she just wants out of our marriage, she said she's been unhappy for a while and just wants out, after some back and forth that changed to she ""just needs time to think"" I freaked out about the whole situation and went to my brothers house, where I would be staying for school and where we had planned to be that night anyways, seeing as my surgery was in the same town. I let her know I would be there and that if she wanted to talk or see me, even at 3am I would drive right down, I just didn't want to be alone so I went to stay with family and I had to be up there to get surgery anyway. I asked her several times to come up because I wanted her face to be the first thing I see when I wake up from surgery but she never replied. She wouldn't answer phone calls, started ghosting me. The surgery came and went and she never even asked me how it went. I tried talking to her several times but she wouldn't reply to any text and when she would talk to me on the phone (only when I called her at work) she would just tell me she's sorry and needs time to think.

I got a text from her mom asking me some general questions and that seemed strange to me, I don't think she'd talk to me about this stuff if she knew what we were going through. I assumed my wife had been staying at her house since she didn't want to stay at our home. I asked my wife where she was staying because I assumed it was her parents and she told me she was staying with her friend Faith. 

I ended up using find my iPhone the next day to see where she was. She was at some house I'd never seen before, miles down the road from where she said she was staying. I called her out on this over text and she again assured me she was at Faiths and the GPS must be wonky because of the bad cell coverage there. 

The next day I turned on the app when I knew she was getting off work and watched her drive straight to this strange house again. I called her when she pulled into the driveway but she of course didn't answer. I then sent her a screenshot of her location and told her if she wasn't honest with me right now I was going to drive over there and pound on the front door. 

The truth finally came out. She has been talking to another guy for a month or so and she lives with him now. They're head over heals in love and she leaving me for him. He's only here temporarily for work so when he goes back to the other side of the country shes wants to go with him, she turned down a huge promotion at work shes been working her ass off for 2 years to get, turned it down two days before it was supposed to go through. She's going to leave her family, friends, career, everything for this new guy. She erased her phone and with it the last ten years of memories we have built together (photos, videos, etc) Then she confessed that the reason she lost all this weight is because she's been abusing pain pills (but stopped cold turkey a couple weeks ago) and not eating but one small meal a day at dinner time with me (I thought she had lost weight from healthy choices) 

I've been a wreck since then, she won't talk to me at all about anything. I know I just need to walk away but I am still very much in love with her, just extremely hurt. I offered everything and anything to try and save our marriage (even forgetting about school) but it all fell on deaf ears.  

It's been 3 weeks now and it only seems to hurt more each day. I feel like there are two people living inside my head, the one that says ""fuck her man, you can never trust her again, give up and move on"" and the one that says ""I love this woman more than anything, I've never loved someone this much and never could again, I need her back.""

All my friends and family tell me I just need to block those thoughts out and focus on school (which starts Monday) but I care about her so much and I feel like she's just having a huge mental breakdown. I also don't know this guy at all and don't know if he's abusive or a manipulator or planning to use her and leave her, I fear for her safety but there is nothing I can do. 

My friends tell me ""She's going to come begging back in 6 months, dont take her back."" but honestly I feel like she won't, even if i couldn't take her back I wish she would give me that call just so I could feel less worthless, like the last ten years didn't mean nothing to her. But she's head over heals for this new guy and pretending I dont exist and the last ten years never happened. 

I've been dealing with some really dark thoughts (about myself) haven't been eating (losing a lot of weight which is nice I guess lol) and I'm lucky if I get a couple hours of sleep every night. 

I'm a wreck, I'm in a deep depression, I don't know what to do, how to make these feelings go away. Honestly I'm not even sure why I am typing all this out, I guess I'm just desperate for any kind of advice. ",relationship_advice
Husband [24M] threw away my [22F] new anti-depressants.,"I have been married to my husband for 1 year. We have a 2 month old daughter.

I feel like I've always been somewhat ""depressed""(/low energy) since adolescence. Ive never been the type of person to be overly excited or motivated by life. I suffered from anorexia when I was in university, and although that's recovered, the feelings of low self worth are still there.

My husband is a stoic, ""no-nonsense"" kind of person. He is not very emotional, but loving in his own way. He is a trustworthy, hardworking, and responsible man.

After I gave birth to my daughter, I had mild postpartum depression.I went to see a therapist but did not take antidepressants since I was breastfeeding. Now, I've decided to formula feed my daughter. I have just been prescribed an antidepressant to take daily. It is supposed to have little/mild side effects.

I took only one dose until my husband saw the drugs and asked me what they were. I told him they were my antidepressants. He said, ""You dont need them. You're fine."" Then said that they have a lot of bad side effects and I'll end up hating my life if I took them. I told him I just wanted to give them a try.

The thing is, I felt very clearheaded after taking just one dose. Maybe it was a placebo effect but I did feel different.

When I came home from work, my pill case was empty. My husband said he had thrown everything away, including my sleep meds, because he said it was better for my health. He also said that he doesn't want his wife to be ""high"" all the time. Which is hypocritical because he smokes weed a lot. 

I was so angry. I can't afford to just get another prescription. How will I tell my therapist? My husband told me to calm down and said it was all for my benefit.
I told him hes not my doctor. He said he knew me better than the doctor did, and he knows Im fine and I dont need any drugs.

What can I do at this point?

TL;DR: Husband threw away my meds because he doesn't think I need them.",relationship_advice
I [24m] was technically raped by a girl [23f] and now she's becoming friends with my friends.,"So a few months ago while out with friends I met and befriended a girl. She was cool, she just had what seemed to be an issue with taking 4loco and Xanax, but other then that she was pretty and seemed fun to talk with. She would come out with me and some friends once and everything seemed fine, but then we saw her pop some pills and drink and she would act c. kind of crazy, and kept showing me photos of herself naked asking for my opinion.  

 I just humored her and said she was pretty and made sure she didn't drink anymore after she had done what she did. Fast forward to later the night, she doesn't want to go home because of her family (I get it family can suck), so I offer to have her stay at my place since I've drank a bit too. So I get a Lyft and we head back to my home. So when we're back I open my couch up since it's a bed as well and get it ready, but she doesn't want to sleep there yet. So being the good guy I just tell her she can watch Netflix with me in my bed til she's tired. 

So as we're watching Netflix, she leans over to me and asks to have sex, but I decline, telling her she's still not sober and I don't want to have sex nor see do I see her in that way. I get it watching Netflix in a bed together can be misleading and I apologized for that. She says okay and that it's cool I don't like her like that, and while we're still in bed, I semi drunkenly doze off. I woke up a bit later, and I feel this sensation, and I open my eyes and I see her on me, riding me. 
      
She looks at me and realizes I'm awake and actually smiles. I feel repulsed, I'm still a bit drunk too, and I don't feel the strength to toss her off, so I pretend to go along with it, fake an orgasm, then I hope out of my bed and go sit on my couch in the living room. I was shaking, I felt gross, but I try to shake it off and just sleep on the couch. I woke up early in the morning, drained because I couldn't sleep, and kept panicking myself awake, and I go and wake her. 

She then asks for sex, and I'm repulsed but I think to myself, maybe if I take control I won't feel this way.  So I agree even though every fiber in my beings screaming no, and we start to have sex, I'm in full control, but I just can't finish, and I stop, and I call a Lyft for her and send her home. So a few months have gone by and I've still been trying to cope with it, I was shamed by men in my family I thought could help me, telling me men can't be raped, and that I'm being a bitch, and I still don't really know how to deal with it but I'm getting by. 

So tonight my friends invite me to their place to hang out, it's been a minute and I'm excited to see them too. When I show up and open the door to their place though (they left it open for me) I notice someone sitting on the couch in the living room with my friends. It's the girl. I felt betrayed, even though I never told my friends, and I felt repulsed. I went pale and my hands became clammy, and when my friend saw my face he came over and asked if I was okay,  I told him nothing and just left. So right now it's 3 something in the morning, I'm drained and don't know what to do. How do I tell my friends what happened? In my heart I know they wouldn't be like my family, but I trusted my family and they said I was overreacting and being a bitch when I thought they'd never say something like that. I'm afraid my friends will too.

Am I (29M) justified in remaining cut off from my sister (28F) to the extent that I have? Family is starting to ask that I mend fences...,"My sister is a lesbian. My ex girlfriend and fiancee of 6 and a half years realized she was bisexual. My sister and I were close and I mentioned this to her. That said my sister is someone who basically enjoys screwing around and then ditching her partners after she's had enough. Under the guise of basically giving my girlfriend advice she did her thing, seduced her and slept with her.




I found out because when my fiancee was acting weird I ended up snooping and seeing a shit ton of messages and a number of dirty pics exchanged. As far as I know their affair went on for a few weeks before I found out. I blew up at both of them, ended things and have not spoken to my sister in 3 years. At get togethers I don't acknowledge her unless it's to be an A-Hole to her. But she's mostly dead to me outside of snide snappish remarks. We used to be thicker than thieves and what she did cut me deep. I knew she was a skirt chaser but I never imagined once she'd go for my ex at the time. 



I'm not as angry as I used to be but it's the principle of the thing for me. She had some health scares within the last year or so and recently she got into an accident. It's been a rough period of time and my parents, a couple grandparents and two of our siblings have asked me to maybe put aside our issues as her health is more important. I told my brother to let her f*ck his wife and see if he'd be saying the same thing. 




She's started asking for me a bit more which I know through my folks. On the one hand it's entirely possible she might be dead within a few years and I'm not sure how I feel about that but on the other, it's like I said, we were always super close and she committed probably the worst sort of betrayal ever. It's not like we were distant siblings where maybe I'd understand because we had no sort of relationship but we were best friends. I was the first person she told that she thought she was a lesbian back when we were teenagers. She was that annoying sister who followed me around a lot and generally tried to spend lots of time with me. We saw movies, played video games, went cycling and did other things together. She went into dental school because of my encouragement. I was there beaming like an idiot at her graduation taking pictures like crazy. I'm just trying to give an idea of how close we once were which should help whoever reads this to understand how much what she did hurt. 



So am I justified in remaining cut off from her? Should I try to mend fences given her situation? What would you do in my place? 




TL;DR Lesbian sister seduced my girlfriend of many years when she admitted she was bisexual, we haven't really spoken in years and after a number of health scares over the last year my family has been asking me to maybe extend an olive branch, she's also been asking for me",relationship_advice
"My (32F) boyfriend (35M) got in an accident in my car, didn't tell me, and now refuses to do anything about it.","Throwaway because this shit is embarrassing af.

I have been with my (32F) boyfriend (35M) for a little over three years.

Every once in a while I will let him drive my car when his is low on gas or if he has the good parking spot and doesn't want to move etc etc. A couple weeks ago I get a call from my insurance company letting me know they need a statement about the accident.

Um. What?

After a solid 45 minutes of adamantley proclaiming this lady was full of shit and that there was no accident the insurance rep said, ""Well we have a report that (boyfriends name) was in an accident in bla bla parking lot on this date claiming he was driving his girlfriend's car"". Oh.

I call my boyfriend, he denies up and down that there was no accident. I explain the call I received and he replies with, ""ooooooh yeah I forgot about that"". Apparently he had been dodging calls for over a month and did not tell me any of this was going on. There was no damage to my car, so there was no reason for me to think anything had happened. So, yesterday I was trying to work out with the insurance company details, get him to make a statement, and its impossible. He stopped responding to my texts about the situation so I call him. He clears it. I call him again. He clears it. He texts me, ""I am with my parents."" Okay, but this is a serious situation and I need to speak with you about it can you please answer? ""I don't want to fight with you in front of my parents."" This isn't a fight, I need details about the accident from you! He won't take my call. So, I send him kind of a shitty text something along the lines of, ""You can't even show me the respect to take my call about something serious? This isn't even a real relationship to you."" Silence.

Finally after about 2 hours of radio silence (and me very very upset) I call again. He says ...

""I don't have the energy to do this with you right now. I'm painting. I don't want to talk.""

I say ...

""What about my feelings? What about me?""

He says ...

\*scoff\* ""what ABOUT you?"" and hangs up. I haven't heard from him since. I know he is waiting for me to break down and contact, as that has historically been the case.

I need some help drafting my response to this situation. I am frozen in shock and pain and am at a loss on what the next step is.

\*UPDATE\* it is 12:15pm my time, and still not a word from this fool. He gives no fucks. I am done.

\*SECOND UPDATE\* So. He contacted. The text I just got was ""we have the kind of love that was forged in adventure, and sealed in the bedroom"" What!!? No mention of the accident or the fight? HOW DO I EVEN RESPOND TO THIS?",relationship_advice
Is my friend being inappropriate with my boyfriend?,"Best friend (23f) says she's just friends with my boyfriend (24m) and I'm being crazy/jealous about their friendship. I think I'm justified in telling her to back off because she's crossing lines. 

Context:
We both met him at a party a few summers ago and he and I started dating soon after. She's never made any indication she was romantically interested in him and encouraged the two of us from the beginning. She's also been obsessed with her on again, off again boy for years and no other guy has really caught her interest. 

She and my BF text a lot. They're really close, but it's never been an issue before.  She asks him for advice on her man, and he gives her a dude perspective on it. But then stuff got weird. She started joking about how if I don't hurry up and ""lock him down"" she will because he's such a great guy. She's said it around him before and he just shrugs it off but I find it uncomfortable. She tells me I'm too sensitive and have no sense of humor, and that the only man she's interested in is her dude. 

Then she started texting us whenever she knew we were together, with all of her drama, asking for advice like the world is ending. So we both stop and respond. 

Then she started inviting herself on dates with us. (""Oh, I've been dying to see that movie / try that restaurant / do that thing""). The three of us hang out ALL the time, but she's suddenly super needy and not letting my bf and I be a couple. For his part, he's oblivious. He thinks we get plenty of alone time since we live together. 

THEN she invited him on this backpacking trip she and her brother are taking across Europe. I was not invited. I only even found out because my BF mentioned he'd need to take off two weeks to do half of it with them (they're doing a full month). He only has two weeks of vacation time as a new hire so he can't do her trip and the trip to Florida we were planning. He asked if I would be okay with that, and if I would want to go with them instead of Florida, but I'm not big on the whole backpacking experience, especially the hiking parts. I'm so hurt that he's even considering her trip over ours. And when I asked her why I wasn't invited, she told me I could come, but I wasn't going to be able to keep up with their itinerary (I have an old knee injury from soccer that kind of kills my hiking abilities and means i walk slow as hell after a while because it hurts like a b*tch). 

Am I being a jerk? Is their relationship normal and I'm just being paranoid? At this point I'm just waiting to hear that her brother suddenly can't go, and it'll be just the two of them... I've told him how I feel about her, but he thinks it's just her personality to be needy. I can tell he's frustrated that I'm upset, but he's also frustrated because he feels like he has to choose between us. 

EDIT/UPDATE: I am absolutely overwhelmed with the responses from everyone. Truly, honestly, thank you to everyone for your advice. I wish I could respond to everyone individually but this got way more attention than I thought it would. 

I'm bracing for the conversation with my BF. I will be clear on what makes me uncomfortable and what I want him to do, though I'll try not to make it an ultimatum. As for my friend, I'm cutting those ties. If a ton of Reddit STRANGERS can turn up and care more about me and my comfort/well-being, than what kind of a friend is she to ignore it? I can't unsee how terrible she is now.

FINAL UPDATE:
Boyfriend is NOT going on the trip, but I still don't think he fully understands how inappropriate even thinking about it was. We're working on better communication, so there's that. 

""Friend"" threw a fit about me getting in the way of her friendship with my BF. I've given up trying to get through to her. I showed my BF some of her crazier texts, and that's also helping open his eyes.",relationship_advice

My tween daughter's birthday trip has gotten hijacked and I'd appreciate some outside perspective,"My tween daughter is part of a friends group. I, her mother, am friends with the mothers of her friends group. This can make tween drama pretty complicated. Anyways, she's had a hard year, so my husband and I told her that we'd take her to Universal for fall break (her birthday falls in the middle of it) and that she can bring a friend. She chose her Friend A, and I made sure A's parents had zero plans during fall break before extending the invitation. At first they said A could go, then that they'd also go since it's so far away... Now it has all changed. Now A and her younger sister B have invited a mutual friend of all of the girls and they are doing a Universal/Disney trip over Fall break. The whole point was for my daughter to have a friend ride down, stay with us on property, you know, the works. They'd bond, have fun, it was going to be great. Now I feel like she'd be a side attraction that would just meet up with the other group of 3 that will be staying with each other. I feel offended and feel that my friend, A's Mom, has hijacked what was supposed to be a special trip. 
Before I end this I want to say that I want to know if I'm just being ridiculous or not. While it might sound petty, this age is savage and girls can be unkind. There has been a lot of drama between the girls and I'm just worried about my daughter getting her feelings hurt. I'm not sure how to navigate this situation. Please give this Momma some advice.

Edited to add: we've already spent money, bought the extra Universal ticket, and my daughter was so excited that her and A were going. Now A's family is doing their own thing and A isn't coming with us anymore. My daughter feels like she's been cut out of her own plans. A's family made these plans out of thin air, which they can do as they please, but I feel that we were done wrong.",relationship_advice
I (29F) think my husband (32M) wants to have sex with our dog,"I'm sorry for the clickbait title but it's honestly what I'm worried about at this point and I'm hoping for some serious advice please. 

My husband and I have been married for 3 years now, he's never shown any sign of being interested in beastiality, furry porn or the like. For the first 2 years of our marriage we lived in an apartment where we weren't allowed pets and never expressed wanting any besides a ""oh a dog or a cat might be cool one day."" 

We moved into a house last year and pretty much as soon as we were settled he consistently brought up wanting to get a dog. I wanted to focus on starting a family first but he brought up the point that taking care of a dog would be a good first step and I agreed with that. Eventually I gave in and 4 months ago we got a 2 year old female German Shepard from the shelter named Molly.

Now ever since we got her, every time we have sex, she's always present in the room. At first I didn't think much of this until I noticed the bedroom door was always shut. We live alone so this didn't seem necessary to me, but when I started opening it my husband would always make sure it was closed. I tried closing it a few times and initiating sex with him while Molly wasn't in the room but every time he would say he needed to pee or needed a glass of water and would leave, then come back with Molly following after him before shutting the door again. I asked him why he kept letting her in our room and he said it's because he doesn't like leaving her alone somewhere in the house where she could get hurt. But when I said we leave her alone in the house all day while we're at work he said that's different because he doesn't have a choice then. This seemed strange to me but I decided it was probably just him being protective of his new baby. 

But things kept escalating to the point where she started jumping on the bed sometimes while we were in the middle of the act and I'd try and shoo her off but my husband would tell me to just let her stay and ignore her.  I told him it makes me uncomfortable but he just told me I was overreacting and that he thinks it's funny because this way he can say he has ""2 girls in bed with him"".  I put my foot down and said she's not allowed on the bed at all from now on and this caused a bit of an argument between us where he started asking ""if she was a baby would I be saying the same thing?"" Obviously if she was a baby I wouldn't be saying the same thing, all the points of his argument just seemed irrelevant and like he was trying to manipulate me emotionally. 

Eventually it was settled that she wasn't allowed on the bed anymore and that was that for awhile. Until a month or two later when I came home early one day and saw him and Molly in the backyard. He was bent down and it looked as if he was inspecting her genitals. When I opened the back door to ask what he was doing he jumped up as if he had been caught doing something wrong and said he was just trying to untangle a patch of matted fur next to her back leg. When I asked why he jumped he said it was because he wasn't expecting me home early and I startled him. This seems plausible to me tbh but combined with everything I thought I should mention it. Also I looked later to see if I could find any patches of matted fur but it was all perfectly fine. 

A few weeks after this we both took Molly to a dog park where another dog began to hump her. I told my husband to stop them but he just laughed and asked what the problem was. I told him I didn't want to have to deal with a litter of puppies but he still didn't do anything and just kept watching them so I went and broke them up with the help of the other owner. When I asked my husband why he didn't help he said that she is actually neutered and should be allowed to have some fun. I took her to the vet the following week to confirm this and he was right.

For the past few weeks he's been talking about us getting another dog but that idea makes me really uncomfortable considering he already gives most of his spare time to Molly as it is. He just seems overly affectionate with her. He cuddles with her more than he does with me and on more than one occasion I've overheard him quietly talking to her but he always stops when I come into the room. I don't see why he would need to stop if he was just saying something normal. 

I brushed this all off as me being paranoid and overthinking due to my anxiety until a few nights ago he left his laptop logged in. I know this was a violation of trust but I'm glad I did it because I found a folder of furry pornography. I'm not sure if it can be considered beastiality because it was all cartoons and they all had human characteristics but majority of the pictures were clearly depictions of German shepherds. Is this confirmation that he's interested in sex with animals? None of the pictures had actual humans in them and from what I've read being a furry means you're more interested in being the animal? 

And what about all the other events leading up to this? The only porn I saw was cartoons but he seems very interested in the real thing as well, or is it possible all the other events are purely coincidental and my mind has just stitched them together? I don't know if I want to have children with a man that's interested in these sorts of things. I understand being a furry is a kink but beastiality in my books is a step down from pedophilia.  

Obviously I need to talk to him about this but I really don't want to and I have no idea how I would even bring it up to him? Do I admit to snooping on his laptop? Or should I just say I think his relationship with our dog is a bit strange and hope that opens up a dialogue? 

And my most important question: 

Am I overreacting or is this a legitimate cause for concern?


TL:DR - my husband seems extremely close with our German Shepard and I recently found furry porn of German shepherds on his laptop.

"Should I tell my parents about the ""thing"" going on between my brother and our cousin","Hi need some advice. I[15F] need advice about my brother [17M] and our cousin [18F] are having sex. It's pretty damn obvious she's into him and everybody knows she has a thing for him she literally throws herself at him. She will always touch him, cuddle him, and (I'm a girl so I know this stuff) she rubs her chest on him whenever he walks by or hugs her. Then she always says ""he's mine, only mine"". She's weird, my brother is nasty for going through with it

So our families don't live very close but we visit each other very often and the visits last multiple days to weeks at a time. The last time we went, they're house is kinda weird . It's basically my brother and I and our 3 female cousins. They have 3 rooms and an rv. When we visit, my parents sleep in the rv, her parents sleep in their room, and all of us kids slee in 2 rooms. These 2 rooms are attached but have no door. She (obviously) said she and my brother would sleep alone in one room and us 3 other girls will sleep in the other one on the bunk beds.

I couldn't sleep that night so I was bored and basically just looking around. I saw AND heard my brother and our cousin banging. Literally as soon as I looked over they were GOING AT IT. I was pretty disturbed so I tried making noise to like get them to shut the fuck up and chill but that didn't work sinve they were too into it so I put earbuds in and listened to music.

[29/F] Found my boyfriend [30/M] of almost 7 years on tinder last night...what do I do?,"UPDATE II: I confronted. There was no denial on his end. He said he did it for validation and apologized. I looked at his bank and didn't see any other charges in past months or years (yeah, I know, he could have been using the free version). I checked his messages (because he didn't properly delete his account) and they were all from that same night, i.e. it's checking out that it was his first time use.

Here's another twist. So, his anxiety stems from an addiction problem, one that has been under control for a few months. While in vegas, he did not use his drug of choice, but turned to something else—Phenibut. I have never heard of this until now, and the almighty Google says when taken in excess the side effects are pretty nuts. He was on this in Vegas.

I'm staying elsewhere tonight. There's more for us to talk about, 7 years is a lot of history.

Oh, his longest conversation was definitely with Jessica. Imagine that—the person he enjoyed chatting with most was actually his partner of 7 years. 
—————————————

UPDATE: This has taken a really unexpected turn...couldn't confront him this evening because he crashed his car on the way home from work. He's fine. Car is totaled. Will share another update tomorrow.

-------------

I'll try to be as concise as possible...

We've been together almost 7 years (we're 30). Boyfriend has been going through a rough time...newly diagnosed anxiety, etc. This has led him to not be as on top of things as he usually is, i.e. bills, so I'm picking up the slack.

He travels for work almost every weekend. Last night, I logged onto his bank because I'm paying bills. I see charges from ""tinder"". He's in Vegas for work. We live in LA.

I make a tinder with a picture of a cute brunette that isn't me. Not shitting you, it takes me 3 swipes before I see his picture. We match within minutes. He chats me, and I keep the conversation going. We talked for about an hour, he did ask ""Jessica"" if she wanted to meet up on the strip with a friend of his and himself. ""Jessica"" didn't want to...boyfriend ends up going home. Oh, he also calls me (actual me) during the middle of this.

I know he went back to his work condo with his co-worker. I know he didn't physically cheat on me last night. I kept the ""Jessica"" convo going with him because I thought if I kept chatting, I could stop him from talking to other matches and in some weird way have some control in a situation that I felt so helpless in. And as I'm reflecting today, it hurts even more to see how he was flirty and fun with ""Jessica"", and at home, he's not. I don't know if he's bored. I don't know if this is his first time using the app (my gut says yes).

My gut also tells me he's going to say he made the account because he was trying to help his shy co-worker meet girls.

Can anyone relate to this or help me figure out how to approach this super fun conversation we're going to have later tonight without going bat shit crazy? NOTE: As of this posting, he has no clue that I know about any of this.",relationship_advice
"Husband of 4 years wants to travel by himself to another country and leave me and my kids so he can have an ""adventure of a lifetime""","My husband of just 4 years told me last night that he would really like to visit the Philippines by himself because he wants to have an ""adventure of a lifetime."" He says this to me after these 3 major things have recently happened:
1. He asked me a few months ago if he can have sex with other women. He said that it's good to ask instead of assume that I won't be ok with it and because I got upset, he now knows that I won't be ok with it.
2. I found a text exchange between him and this girl from the gym a few weeks ago. Yes, it was an innocent, non-sexual text but I've never even heard of this girl before. He then says that he has known her since high school and that there's nothing wrong with the text. Plus, they just always see each other at the gym because they both have ""the same passion for fitness and health.""
3. He has been very nice to his ex-wife recently. She is the mother of his first child. They've been in court for several things and to change the parenting schedule because she accused him of showing porn to their 12 year old son. After several appearances with a magistrate, the son just confessed to his mother that it was him who looked up the porn sites and not his father. The ex now wants to settle a couple of things (she owes him money) outside the court and drop the charges against him related to the porn. 

We now have a beautiful 3 year old daughter and I would hate for her to grow up in a broken home. My husband swears that this trip was just for an adventure and not to have sex with many women. I am in so much anger and pain right now. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Should I just be ok with him going on this ""adventure trip"" so he is happy and we can keep working on our marriage? Should I just file for divorce if he does go without my consent? Do your husbands ask for something like this - to travel on his own to a different country?",relationship_advice
I (29F) found out I own my dead dad's car but my family is pressuring me to give it to his (60F) girlfriend...,"My dad (54) died last month.  We had a very complicated relationship.  He had a girlfriend (60) of 19 years, but they never married, so I'm in the next of kin, heir to the estate, whatever.  He and gf had bought a house together the year before - she's selling that now but needs to fix something in order to close.  She was looking into selling his car and found out that technically I own it now.  So my grandmother calls me to be like, hey you need to sign the car over to GF so that she can sell it to fix the house.  He meant for it to go to her.  So okay sure.  

The thing is, when my great-grandfather died 19 years ago (right around the time they got together), I was left an inheritance that was meant to be used for college.  My dad spent all of it taking himself and GF on vacations to the Caribbean, living off of it, as well as his own inheritance that he got.  I only stayed with him during the summers so it's not like I was enjoying any of this money. He never took me shopping, never took me on a vacation that wasn't Six Flags, he barely even paid child support. 

They were both complicit in this.  My uncles, aunts, and cousins all got their inheritance, but my dad and her spent all of mine and I never saw a penny.  Everytime my mother would ask about it, he'd say ""Something happened to it, idk, it got lost, no it never came through, no his wife kept everything, etc etc.""  He never once admitted to spending it or even acknowledged that it existed. I think my mother talked to the family lawyer at one point and they were basically like, well it was left under his care so he can do what he wants with it.

So I kind of want the car.  It wouldn't be worth much, but it would help me pay off my credit card debt enough to be able to finally start a savings.  I know she needs it to sell the house and I would be burning a huge bridge by doing this, but I am really angry when I think about how I'm being told to ""do the right thing"" when they did not do the right thing when they spent my money when I was a literal child. 

I don't know what to do.  It's legally mine.  She was the one making payments on it.  So I get that it's ""her"" money.  But she was complicit when he spent all of MY money years ago.  I also hate that she had my grandma call to tell me this instead of doing it herself like a coward.  I don't know what to do.

My grandma says this is clearly making me ""sick.""  Well yeah, it's dredging up bad memories of when I was stolen from by my family and had to accrue a shitton of debt to go to college when I could have had a huge leg up.

So do I do the right thing or do I do what's right for me?",relationship_advice
I (41M) am trying to reconcile with my cheating wife (35F). Am I allowed to ask for a proof of trust?,"Nonnative speaker, so please excuse any mistakes.

Update: Wow, thank you for all the replies. I honestly did not expect such a clear answer to my question. I was very doubtful about my point of view. Your comments helped me to open my eyes. I just told her, that I do not want to continue our relationship anymore. Big thank you for all your advice!

&#x200B;

Background info: Together for 13 years, 9 years married, two kids (6 and 1).

Prologue: Two years ago, my wife asked me to sell her old phone. I thought it would be good idea to save all the images of our kids before erasing it and accidently stumbled upon some explicit nudes of her in the ""sent"" folder of a messenger. I confronted her, she admitted sending them, but assured, it was only to one of her female friends. Although she did not want to disclose the recipient, I believed her and never brought it up again.

3 month ago, I found out my wife was cheating on me. I had to find out the hard way, by being alerted by suspicious behavior and putting small pieces of evidence together.

To fully understand my question, I have to go in detail here: We were always a very close couple, spent most of our time together and generally enjoyed each other company. We were not only lovers, but also best friends. When travelling, we sometimes spent several months together 24h/day without being uncomfortable.

A few month ago, my wife suddenly changed, saying that she needs timeouts from busy family life and wants to be alone. She told me, she would go for long walks or meet distant friends. I was completely fine with that at first. Suspicion began to raise slowly, as her stories became more and more implausible. I finally confronted her with some solid proofs of her lies and she confessed the affair a day later. She also admitted, that many of her ""timeouts"" were just an excuse to meet the other guy. My wife promised to end the affair immediately. I believed her and as I still love her, I decided, that I was willing to forgive her.

Since then we didn't really move forward. She agreed to marriage counseling, but stays distant, says that she wants to be alone, is unsure about her feelings for me and needs time to find out if she still wants to be with me. If I make a move towards her (e.g. ask her out for dinner) she mostly considers this as pressure. So, for the moment I have no other option than to stay calm and give her time.

I can handle the uncertain future fairly good, but I am struggling to trust her again. She still goes for long walks regularly and sometimes this triggers me quite hard. While she is away, I often feel miserable, thinking how she might be cheating again. I find myself seeking for proof of my suspicion, like I found the last time.

I know that trust cannot be build up by control and controlling behavior will not help her feelings for me to return, so mostly I don't tell her anymore, when I feel the urge to control her.

I talked to her about my bad feelings at first and suggested to turn on the location tracking feature of her phone during her walks. Just for a limited time, until I feel better. We had a long discussion about it, but in the end, she did not agree, as she doesn't want to be controlled and doesn't think it is helpful to regain trust.

My trust slightly improved over the last few weeks. We made some very small progress in our relationship and I am learning to deal with ""trigger moments"".

Until two days ago… I don't know what exactly was the cause, but I felt like seeing warning signals again that evening. She told me, that she was on the phone with a friend while she was away.

I didn't say anything that evening, but spoke to her the next day. I explained very calmly, that I felt uncomfortable that evening and that she could help me very much, if she would show me the call list of her phone to prove, that she was really on the phone with her friend.

She got very angry, telling me, she won't let me see it, as it would be an invasion into her privacy and I should work on my controlling behavior.

Am I right in thinking, that either she is lying to me again or not wanting to work on our relationship at all (in making a step towards me)?

Or is she right in saying that control should never be an option and there have to be other ways to reestablish trust?",relationship_advice

My (32M) girlfriend (30F) can't accept that I still love (and will always love) my late wife. How can I make her believe I value our relationship despite this?,"My wife died unexpectedly 5 years ago. She was the love of my life and we were together nearly ten years before she passed away. After years of not even wanting to date or be involved with anyone else, I got together with my current girlfriend about one and a half years ago. We get along great and I honestly do love her. We moved in together 4 months ago. Everything about our relationship is great except she doesn't believe it's ""right"" that I still love my wife and miss her. She doesn't like the fact that I still have some of her things and photos of her etc. I thought she had a point about her/our photos being all around our apartment (she moved in with me) being disrespectful to her so I took the ones in the living room and bedroom but kept some in my study which is a room that mainly I only use. I also put all the other stuff I have of hers and from our time together in a cupboard in my study and keep it locked. I feel like I have made many an effort to reassure her and make her comfortable yet she is still not happy. She doesn't like that I still talk to my wife's family. She kind of expects me to pretend I was never married which is ridiculous. We have been fighting more and more because of this.  

I really do love my girlfriend but when she asks me things like whether I love still love my wife or whether I love her more than I do my girlfriend, it's hard for me to lie and say that I don't. And I don't think I should be expected to either. I didn't want my wife to die. I never wanted to have to find anyone else. But that is what happened and I love my girlfriend too. But I will always love my late wife too. How can I convince her that this is indeed possible? Am I not being accommodating enough? Am I being unfair to my girlfriend?

Edit: I did not expect so many comments and I cant reply to them al but I would like to clear some things up.I never told her that I consider my late wife the love of my lif. It's just the way I feel. But I do understand the point everyone is making about this being unfair to my girlfriend. I honestly do love her and try to be a good partner to her. But I think I do have to think about what is best for her and that may not be being with me. But at the same time I feel lile that is ultimately her decision. We do have a great relationship otherwise. From the comments, I have realised maybe I can never be ready to be in a relationship in the same way with someone else and that is unfair to my gf. She deserves better.A serious discussion is definitely needed.",relationship_advice
I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"Update: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cugm1i/update_i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft/?

TL;DR: Looked in her clothes drawer. Expected to find a uniform shirt. Found a floppy dong.

We've been dating for four years, moved in together a few months ago.

We each keep our clothes in our own separate chests of drawers, which helps us to avoid mix-ups on clothing. We can usually almost fit each other's sizes, though her stuff tends to be tight on me and my stuff tends to be tentlike on her. We work the same job, on occasionally differing shifts, and while I've always realised her shirt is too tight to be the right one before accidentally wearing it into work, she has occasionally worn my tents on shift  without realising.

Anyway, this happened yesterday. I had to leave for work in a few minutes (she'd already been on shift for a few hours), and there was no sign of any of my uniform shirts. She hadn't been wearing it when I left, so I figured it might have been put away with her things.

I was going through the drawer she keeps her shirts in... and then suddenly I felt something weirdly squishy. I didn't even think, I just pulled it out. And there it was, wrapped up in a little crop top: The Dong. Three inches at most, Caucasian-coloured, and floppier than a disk.

I kinda stared for a bit. It was in a harness, so my first thought was to expect a talk about enhancing our love life with the joys of pegging. (Which would surprise me from her? She's barely a sexual person at all. But I'd consider it!) But this thing was _soft_. Fully flaccid. No way you'd be able to get that into my puckered behind, not without a LOT of uncomfortable shoving.

So I couldn't help wondering, what was this thing for? I think she'd have the same issues fitting it into herself, and the harness made me think she'd be wearing it. Does she just stroll around wearing it, acting cocky? Is she experiencing the joys of helicoptering? Honestly, I'd probably get a cock to helicopter with if I were a girl, so I _completely_ understand.

Eventually I stopped staring in wonderment and put the floppy thing away so I could find a damn shirt. Eventually had to take a dive into the dirty washing basket, which I'm not proud of. We overlapped by about an hour at work, but we work in different sections, so had no time for much more than ""hi""/""bye"" as we passed each other. Certainly no mention of floppydong.

Like a flaccid phallus to the face, a realisation hit me a couple of hours in. In my hurry, I hadn't wrapped the dick up in the crop top again. Nor had I buried it back under the mountains of clothes concealing it. It had simply lain bare on the surface, making it clear to every Dick, Tom and Harry that someone had made the dickscovery.

I felt like I'd committed a cardinal sin doing this. We never established that each other's drawers were off-limits, but ""de facto"" they were, and now I'd crossed a line by uncovering something she'd been keeping a secret.

It gets worse: every day when she gets home from work and I'm not around, she messages me about how her day was. Funny things, shitty customers, how hard or stressful the workload was today. Just anything. She's 100% consistent about it, and I always look forward to receiving it...

... but today, she sent just one message.

""got home""

That's all, folks.

She'd been really happy when I saw her on my way in and her way out. Something must have happened. Either her commute home really sucked, or she knows I've found her secret.

She was asleep when I got back (I was on the overnight shift). I'm here sorta panicking and writing this all out and making dick jokes.

I really never thought I'd be using this forum, but I need help here. I want her to know that this is okay, whether it's a sex toy or a helicoptering toy or whatever. I respect her privacy, and her use of this, and I want her to know that she doesn't have to hide things like this. But as I said, she's really not much of a sexual person. At least, she's rarely very sexual with me, and doesn't seem to enjoy sex too much. Which is fine! But if she owns something like this, maybe she's just deeply ashamed, and that'd be a lot to work through.

Part of me wants to pretend this never happened, pretend it just stayed hidden. Hell, maybe she actually doesn't know I found it, and that message was just some unrelated bad mood. But I don't think I can really just ignore the consequences now. Gotta face them.

Relationship in jeopardy because I (21m) asked my fiancé(21f) for a prenup.,"Me and my girlfriend have been together since we were in the 6th grade. I love and trust her more than ANYTHING in the world. Shortly after hs she decided to go to college and I decided not to so I could pursue starting a business like I dreamed of. Long story short, I was lucky enough to be successful quickly and sold my first startup 2 years after graduating for a very large amount of money. We decided together that she would drop out of college and work for me as an employee on my second company and we would live together. Not too long after that I proposed, she said yes, and then the happy side of the story ends. Now I hate to admit it, but I absolutely worship money. I know people say it's not a good thing to do, but I grew up watching my single mom struggle to put food on the table for me and my siblings. Often going nights hungry because she had to feed a family with $20 and wanted to leave enough for us. It was engrained in my mind that I needed to make money so I could support my mother and younger siblings so they don't have to live under those conditions anymore. So when I proposed a prenup to my girlfriend she was livid. She couldn't believe that I didn't trust her or have any faith in our relationship, and felt outright disrespected that I would even entertain the idea. She left me with an ultimatum of no prenup or no relationship at all. I'm completely conflicted. She's the love of my life and I genuinely do trust her with every bone in my body, but I can't jeopardize the stability of the financial freedom I'm providing for my mom and my younger siblings (4 of them oldest being 15 youngest is 6). I don't want to put their lives in the hands of somebody they don't know as well as me and can't trust, because if worse case scenario happens and we get divorced I need to know that won't effect us in anyway. Any advice?


Edit 1: I see a lot of people assuming I coerced her into dropping out of college and sacrificing her future to help me and my dreams out. This isn't the case. She wanted to drop out because she hated driving to and from my house and college all the time and leaving stuff at her dorm or my house when she needed it. She wanted to just live with me and work and I told her I'm ok with that (I was actually ecstatic bc I ofc wanted to see her all day), then offered her a receptionist job since it was easy and nearby since she wanted to work. She DID NOT drop out and help me build my company. It was already operational.


Edit 2: I also idiotically forgot to mention that I kinda rained on her parade when I did it. She seemed like she was having the time of her life planning the wedding and I kinda just sacked her with a prenup. Should've found a way to ease into it in hindsight.",relationship_advice
My ex was recently in a car accident and now has amnesia and thinks we are still together.,"A throwaway for obvious reasons but I am mentally breaking down and this feels so unreal and so incredibly confusing I need help desperately. 

Backstory: My ex of 3 years broke up with me about a year ago. We were at different points in our lives and things were becoming strained. She said she had wanted to break up because she was young and wasn't even sure if marriage was something she ever wanted. (I had made it clear I wanted to marry someone at least some day hoping it would be her) I told her I loved her and let her go knowing that I didn't want to restrict her from finding herself or getting to a point where we would end up hating one another from the pressures of the time. Everything was fine until about a month later she began dating someone half way across the U.S. (us in OK he I NJ) I was devasted. I thought she wanted to explore and find herself and I hope by letting her do this that maybe one day we could try to reconvene as more mature people. But no, she met some guy from Jersey in Louisiana during Mardi gras and they started dating. They maybe see eachother 7 weekends out of the year. All the reasons we had broken up for seemingly meant nothing because then she just started doing it with someone else. 

It's been a little over a year now and we haven't talked in months. I'm finally starting to get past the depression and make forward progress in my life. Until the other night... Her father called me in a panicked voice and began to apologize for a reason I didn't know. When I called him down he said my ex had been in an accident with her mother. Apparently she took a good hit to the head and went unconscious. When she came to she asked about me and to her disturbance, they told her she had left me and was now dating Mr. jersey. She refused to believe it because apparently her memory went back to what was probably the best part of our relationship. She refused to talk to her current bf and was adamant about calling me. I guess her father gave in eventually and asked if I would be ok with talking with her. Of course I wanted to talk to her. Someone I loved was injured and I was concerned. The phone call was so hard... She cried and asked what was happening and what had happened to us and just keep repeating how much she loved me... I hadn't heard her say that to me in over a year. After the call I told her father I was sorry, but to please not contact me anymore. I know their situation is difficult but this isn't easy for me either. He respected my wishes and let me off the hook. Unfortunately though she unblocked me from her phone and began to txt and call me about what was happening and why wouldn't I talk to her and who's Mr. Jersey? I had to block her for my own mental health... I can't go back there again only to have her regain her memory and leave me again... I can't do that twice. But I feel like I need to be there for her as well! Shes hurting and confused and I hate seeing someone I still love like that... I feel like I'm being selfish but I can't go back to that depression when she leaves me again for him... Help...

EDIT: Wow... What an incredible flow of comments today. Some incredibly supportive, some skeptical, and some... Well just not helpful. I think my final decision is this; I'm going to write her a letter describing our relationship and what the outcome of it came to be. I'll be giving it to her father for approval who will then hopefully get it approved through the doctors to then pass it on to her. I haven't been responding to quite as many comments now because I've been handwriting this letter for the last 2 hours. It's hard to put all that's happened into an adequate letter. But that will be as far as my involvement goes in her recovery. It's a decision that really hurts me deeply but for the sake of both us moving forward and our own mental health this will be it. Maybe someday we can have open dialogue again but I do not see this happening for years to come. I love her, and I wish her all the best. Maybe I'll get a chance again one day, but this isn't how it should happen. Not in a confusing and vulnerable moment. Thank you all so much for the advice no matter what side you may have been on.",relationship_advice

I [22m] told my girlfriend [20f] the truth about my scars and she left.,"We've been dating for 8 months. She's easily the best thing that has ever happened to me. Last night we got into a huge fight and she said she's sick of me being secretive (which is totally fair) and gave me an ultimatum to explain myself or she'd leave. So I basically broke down and came clean about some really shitty parts of my past (pretty extreme child abuse etc). She said she needed space to ""process"" since she has had her own traumatic experience. That's fine and I totally respect that but then today the only thing she has said to me is that she's ""not sure"" about us anymore. 

I never ever meant to be triggering and I have been avoiding this conversation forever because I was afraid it would freak her out and that's exactly what happened. She disclosed her trauma to me when we first started dating and now she's saying she feels stupid for telling me because what I experienced ""makes hers seem stupid."" I feel fucking awful. I never meant to make her feel invalidated. 


TL;DR I finally told my girlfriend the truth about where my scars came from and basically scared her away. 

She already goes to therapy and I'm wait listed but what can I do to fix this for now?

My wife is on her way home to confront me for cheating (I never have) how should I handle this?,"Been married seven years. She just recently started this and I don't know why. I never do anything suspicious and to me it seems so irrational. Last night I ate dinner with my grandpa and had drinks. My phone was on silent and she called five times in five minutes. I called her back three minutes after that and she freaked out.  She was saying how she knew I was cheating all along and this proves it. She was in bed when I got home. This morning she sent a text saying we are going to talk about my cheating tonight. She's on her way home.

What should I do? It's so obvious that I was with my grandpa the whole time. Why would she suddenly start thinking I'm cheating? It's just been getting worse and worse. I don't know what to say during this talk.

(Update: Talk never happened. She locked herself in the bedroom. Never said a word to me. It's going to be awkward when I go in there to go to bed later. Not sleeping in the spare room.)

(Update: see was watching a show and I walked by the bedroom at a weird part and made a joke about it. She laughed and we talked casually and I knew I'd be able to go to bed so I went to bed a little while after that. I'm in bed now. She's asleep now but earlier she shifted her body into cuddle positions several times pretending to be asleep. I know she was awake. Thanks for all the advice but now I don't know what to think. Maybe she's feeling neglected, she's cheating, wants out of the relationship, or she's crazy? I know it has to one of those but all of them seem so sudden. I've always been really confident in our relationship and the thought of this happening now is just too much for me to accept. I'll let you know if I figure it out.)

(Hopefully final update: this is the most popular post I've ever had so it's too hard to respond to all the comments. Thanks for the advice. Sorry I can't respond to all of you. 
We talked this morning and I think we're good now. She says she's feeling insecure and it all started a few months ago. Her parents invited us on a two week vacation and I decided not to go but she wanted to go so she is going along with our kid. The idea that I might be cheating got into her head and it just got worse and worse. Every time I came home from work late, went out with my friends, or was too tired for intercourse it just got worse. To top it all off one of her friends at works husbands cheated recently. She also said that I've been distant to her and our 6 year old for years and she thinks I drink alcohol too much. (I've always been like that because that's who I am.) I told her I'll do better. I believe her story and don't think she's cheating or crazy. Thanks again guys. If anything changes I'll let you know.",relationship_advice
Should I tell my boyfriend I was raped by one of my friends last night,"***UPDATE POST OTW!*** I just wanted to make it clear that I will be posting another update on a separate post. I have been getting a lot of hurtful responses claiming I was just drunk and cheating. I want to clear that up as well as thank you all for the helpful information and overwhelming responses. I want to let you guys know that I am going to report him when I go to the hospital to get evidence and tested. Thank you so much for everything! 


I stupidly got drunk. I usually know my tolerance level but I'm on anti depressants so I think it messed with me in the end. I just remember being put on a bed at my friends house and my guy friend spooning me. Next thing i know he's in me and covering my mouth. Also forced me to give him deep throat and I almost threw up on him. I know I was moaning like I was enjoying it but I remember thinking it was my boyfriend half the time because I so drunk out of my mind. I don't know what to do. I feel so disappointed in everything that had happened and that I was so dumb to let it happen to me. I haven't talked to my ""friend"" since. I don't think I want to see him anymore after that. 

Should I tell him? What should I do? I feel like shit physically and emotionally. 

Update: it's been a minute but after typing it all out I feel much differently. It feels like I woke up from a horrifying nightmare. I'm 19 I'm too young to be dealing with bullshit. I feel like I fucked up big time. Nothing about the situation feels normal but at the same time it feels like a recurring theme in my life. I've grown up being sexually abused by a family member who is currently in the process of being convicted for child pornography. It just doesn't seem fair. Last night all I wanted was to have fun with my friends before the semester started. And to everyone who had to read through everything, I'm sorry. I want to say sorry to my parents and my boyfriend and my friends and to God. It's ironic because yesterday I told my parents I wanted to go to church again but this morning I couldn't bring myself to face my sins. My plan for now is to try and get as much of my shit together. The semester starts tomorrow and I feel like my world has been flipped upside down. I've missed taking my meds yesterday and I have already been a day behind for a week. I can feel myself falling again. I'm trying guys, I really am. Whoever is reading this, I'm trying. 

[WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN DETAIL - VERY NSFW]

Four friends including me, I am the youngest(19f everyone else is 20+), another girl (lesbian), and two guys had a bonfire for one last get together before the semester begins. It was also a reunion since we haven't all been together in 2-3 ish years. We drink, I am very petite so I know my limit is 3 shots of hard liquor. Which is what I did, but (I suspect it's my meds) I got shit faced and had no control of myself after that. We wrapped up and went inside. 

The ""friend"" that eventually ended up raping me and my other guy friend helped me get settled (because apparently I am a crazy drunk if I drink Jameson) into bed. The ""friend"" told my other guy friend to go home and that he would take care of me. After that it's hazy in my memory. 

I remember him being on top of me and covering my mouth forcefully. I couldn't make any noises. He was in me and attempting to have sex with me. I was obviously dry because I had no idea what the fuck was happening so he eventually gave up fucking me and instead took my head and forced me to deep throat him until I almost puked. He didn't finish. So we slept. I woke up again to him fingering me until I was wet enough, at this point I thought he was my boyfriend? He ended up finishing.

Afterwards I went to the room where my lesbian friend was sleeping and I told her what happened jokingly. Later in the morning we talked about it more and she wants to kill our ""friend."" She is a witness to how little he drank and kept mentioning that he not only raped me but cheated on his girlfriend....",relationship_advice
UPDATE (should I (26F) reach out to my long lost brother (18M) that doesn't know I exist?),"So I posted a long time ago about a delimna to reach out to a brother that I was seperated from when he was a baby. For the details you can see the original post


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7spomt/should_i_26f_reach_out_to_my_long_lost_little/?utm_source=reddit-android



I first want to say thank you to anyone who re2aponded.


I decided I would reach out to my brother once he graduated high school, which he did this past summer. I called my older brother, we will call him A, and asked him if he was ready to reach out to him with me and he said he needed to wait just a little longer because he was going to be super busy at work for a while and wanted to have time available to dedicate to talking to our brother. So we waited a little longer..


Well a month passed, and A called me and said he was ready. We decided to message him on fb. I basically said ""I know this is out of the blue, and I'm not sure how to say this but I am your sister. If you would like to talk or meet up let me know.""


I was expecting to wait a long time for a reply and for it to possibly not be positive. To my surprise he replied back pretty quickly and said he knew I was his sister and that he had wanted to reach out to me but he was afraid. We continued talking and he was so open and happy to speak to A and I. The crazy thing is, he hadn't known about us until only a month prior when an Uncle told him. I had been stalking his facebook for years wanting to talk to him but always feeling like it wasnt the right time and when I finally felt it was right, he just so happened to of just found out. It is like the stars aligned.


We have been messaging and talking on the phone for half a week until we finally met in person today. It is crazy how talking to him feels so natural. He is a wonderful kid, and a young and very loving father. We are really enjoying finding out all our similarities and laughing at our differences. 


As for my Dad, he is happy that we have found each other. He looks forward to the day he gets to meet my brother. But that day will be when my brother is ready. He wants to build a relationship with A and I first while he processes his feelings about our Dad. We will see when that day comes but there is currently no rush.",relationship_advice
"My husband wants a ""white"" name for our baby","I'm Middle Eastern and my husband is white. When we started dating, I told him that my culture was a big deal for me and I wasn't sure if we'd last since I was probably gonna be more interested in someone who had the same ethnicity and values and all that. Not only that, my parents are strict Catholics and he didn't even know what religion he was, he said he was maybe Christian or something but he wasn't sure. He was pretty insistent that he'd try, he chased me for a while and he took me to a middle eastern restaurant for our first date. So corny but I love him. He was really open to learning about my culture and everything, he was almost fascinated with it all. Basically, my life was My Big Fat Greek Wedding - I was partially embarrassed by everything and thought it would scare him away but he seemed to love it. 

We got married and things were going well, I'm pregnant now and we were talking about our baby. Some stuff that he said just bothered me and I wanna know if I'm crazy or was it weird? 

I have pale skin and black hair and brown eyes, but green eyes do run in my family. My husband has brown hair and green eyes. He had bleach blond hair as a baby, like the blondest baby ever and it darkened by the time he was a kid. We were talking about how our baby would look and I was teasing him that she'd definitely look like me because darker features are dominant and he has brown hair too and then he brought up how he used to be blond. So I told him how you know, my hair is pretty much black so she's probably gonna have really dark hair, I don't think she'll have a blond phase. He seemed kind of upset about that because he wanted his daughter to have cute blond hair but I told him it was okay and she'll have green eyes like him and he was like ""no I'm pretty sure she's gonna come out looking like one of you guys"" ... I told him that yeah she's gonna look at least a little Arab. I don't even know what that meant. I didn't wanna ruin the mood so I just continued the talk and he seemed upset in a way. 

We started talking about baby names and he had really cute name ideas. They were nice but I asked him what he thought about the names I liked and he just blurted out ""can we give her a white name? She's my baby too"". I was not giving her ""ethnic"" names. I brought up American names too. I really liked Diana for example, which is Arabic and I know my family would really like that and it's an English name too. I can't exactly go to my parents and be like ""Yeah our baby's name is Jennifer."" Not only that, I want her name to be related to my culture. Diana doesn't sound ethnic and its obviously not hard to pronounce or anything and she wouldn't bullied at school. And it's a ""white"" name. I thought it was the best of both worlds. I would be so open to giving her whatever American middle name he wants but our baby is gonna be 50% middle eastern and 50% white, I think she should have a first name that's connected to both cultures. 

He just got mad and said I wasn't taking him into consideration and he wants to choose the name since I made her look Arab and I got ""my part"" already. I asked him to calm down since we don't even know how she looks and for all we know, she has blond hair and green eyes and looks nothing like me and 100% like him. He just got mad and continued on and then he was like ""by the way, hummus is gross"" and went to bed. Now I'm sitting here in our living room wondering what to do... lol",relationship_advice

My (21 m) girlfriend (21 f) REALLY wants anal. I dont.,"So I've been dating my girlfriend for a while, and things have been good. Sexually, we are very open and we experiment with various kinks. However, recently, she asked me to give her anal (as in, me putting it in her butt, not pegging). This really doesnt appeal to me, and I said no. She dropped it for the moment.

However, she has asked me about it 3 or 4 other times, and I keep saying no. The last time she asked she said something that struck me differently though. She said basically that she had always wanted to do anal, but didnt feel like she could trust any of her previous boyfriends enough to do it, but she feels comfortable with me. Then she said it is frustrating to her that she has finally found someone she is willing to do it with, but that I refuse. She also mentioned that im the only guy she knows that isnt into anal.

I feel like we have a decent back and forth with kinks, and we both have done things that dont do a ton for us personally that make the other happy. So it isnt like i wont indulge any of her fantasies. Just not that one. 

I dont know how to approach this. Ive told her my reasons and im tired of having this conversation. Any advice?

Edit: she says it has to be the D, cant use a dildo

Edit 2: if you are just going to say ""just try anal"" dont comment. That isnt helpful and you know it

Final edit: theres an update now in another post",relationship_advice
Bf took ex gf out for dinner and paid for her food but makes me pay for my own,"My bf(20m) took his ex out to dinner which is totally fine but he paid for her meal.... 

He constantly begs me to pay for him along with myself or he just tells me to pay for my own. To get him to pay for a meal for me is like pulling teeth and is usually not worth the fight.

I'm not jealous but I don't understand why he's willingly pay for his ex's meal when he doesn't for me.. is this a warning sign? Should I be concerned or is this normal? How do I bring up my concern to him?

"Fiancee (28f) cheated after her cousin's funeral while I (28m) was away, together 6 1/2 years","I had to go away for a little over a week for work last week. Her cousin passed away on Wednesday, the funeral was on Saturday. I never really met this cousin and they had a falling out before she and I were together but they used to be close like sisters and were neighbors growing up living on the same street. They saw each other when they couldn't avoid it but generally avoided each other.





On Sunday morning I get a text saying I love you so much, I'm sorry but we need to talk when you get home. I started calling like crazy because that's the worst thing possible you can do IMO sending a message like that. Unfortunately her phone stopped ringing so she must have switched it off. I was worried and panicking most of Sunday and yes my mind jumped to cheating.





So I get home yesterday and she's there and tries to hug me but I pretty much just tell her to say what she needs to say because I was angry she just messaged that to me then went dark. Her cousin died and she was devastated despite their falling out. At the wake on Friday she ends up meeting a family friend and drinking a bit. Then on Saturday after the funeral they end up spending more time together in a group then alone before she had sex with him several times on Saturday night. When she woke up on Sunday it hit her just what she'd done and she freaked out. 




According to her she was devastated, not thinking clearly and just needed something to take her mind off of what happened. She was apparently in a really bad way and wasn't thinking about me or us just then. She's been nothing but apologetic to the point of near groveling since yesterday.




But Idk, I'm devastated, I feel sad because I knew she was always kind of torn up about her falling out with her cousin but this doesn't excuse her hopping into bed to grief fuck away her emotional pain. I mean jesus christ we've been together 6 and a half years, our wedding is in October. And I couldn't even sleep yesterday or last night because I can't stop getting enraged thinking about her being with another man regardless of the reason.




I looked at her this morning and felt nothing except intense sadness and disgust. She tried hugging me and I just left and went for a drive. I took the day off today and I'm regretting that because I'm just at home now with this shit playing through my mind. 



TL;DR Fiance of 6 1/2 years grief cheated on me with another guy while I was working away after her cousin's funeral




**UPDATE/EDIT**: I did not read through every single comment yesterday. However the ones I did read were enough for me to do some thinking last night and realize that I likely won't ever be able to get past this. It would take a truly herculean effort for me to forgive her and move past this and there is every chance in the world that I might just believe I meant it when I forgave her but the pain from her cheating would remain and then reopen like an old wound at a later date.




There's also the whole trust issue thing - I travel for work quite a bit, at least once every two months and at this point I don't know that I'll be able to travel with the peace of mind I used to have before this weekend. I was cheated on in the past and I feel like anytime I get on a plane now I'm going to be worried she's off fucking some other man. I realize this weekend was a complete one off, I know some people may not believe that or agree with it but I know her better than most.



I really do believe her when she said it was a terrible mistake and she wouldn't do it again. I still love her immensely.  **But I wasn't worth being faithful to after 6 and a half years together so she's not worth giving a second chance.** It would be a massive and foolish risk on my part. All she needs to do is be forgiven. I'm the one who would have to work through the pain of being cheated on, the task of trying to forgive her and making sure that I mean it and ultimately going through the extremely painful task of learning to trust her again. So I'm done, as much as that hurts to even begin thinking about and despite the fact that I still love her.",relationship_advice
"My (30M) girlfriend (28F) of 8 months believes that I, as a man, should pay for things 90% of the time","As the title says, my GF believes that women have a tougher time in general than men and therefore men should pay for things like dinner, movies, etc. the vast majority of the time. Once in a while she will offer to split it (not even pay the whole check lol).

I got pretty annoyed last night as I just wanted to hang at her place and cook something and chill (i.e. try not to spend more money eating out!) but she said she didn't feel like cooking and wanted to go out somewhere casual. I was particularly annoyed because we went out the previous week for dinner and drinks and I ended up paying in full for both, without her even making an attempt to pay.

She also earns significantly more than me and she knows this. I'm not sure how to bring up this issue without sounding petty and broke. I don't mind paying say 60% of the time or so, but this shit is starting to hurt my pocket! Do you other women think that her mentality is reasonable?",relationship_advice
I think my (25M) twin brother killed our sister's (22) puppy by feeding the puppy alcohol on purpose.,"Sorry this is so long. Idk where to begin. I have a twin brother and a little sister that my parents adopted when we were 7. I always knew my brother was jealous of our sister. She was the only one in our family to go to college, and she'll be starting graduate school this fall. As you can imagine, everyone is so proud of her, except my brother. He didn't even attend her college graduation because he was busy "" babysitting his friends at a bar.""

He also has always made bad decisions. He does a lot of drugs, has a girlfriend that is a toxic person, and is a total dick to our sister.

Me and my brother currently rent a house, and our sister moved in to the basement since the house is a few blocks away from her school. She always wanted a puppy, so me and my parents contributed to get her a new puppy as a graduation present.

Fast forward to last night, my brother got so so drunk at home with his buddies while I was at work. I texted him asking to give the puppy some fresh water and food. He texted back saying he did. I came back from work this morning, and I see the puppy lifeless near his dog bowl. There was also so a putrid smell prominent near the area. It smelled like bad wine. 

I asked him wtf happened, and he said something along the lines of "" I probably was so drunk I thought the vodka was water."" I don't believe him at all. I think he did it on purpose. 

My sister is currently on vacation and trusted us to watch her puppy. My parent's just want to get her a new puppy and not tell her. She's smart and will find out. How do I tell her? Also, should I cut all ties with my brother, and move me and my sister out somewhere else, maybe back home with the  parents for now? 

TLDR: I think my brother gave alcohol to my sisters puppy and killed it out of jealousy

Edit 1: I have already taken the puppy to the vet, and was told to get a little sample of the liquid in the bowl in a tube that the clinic gave me. My friend and I are going to file a complaint today.

Edit 2: I will update with the results when I get a call from the vet. She said it may take a few days.",relationship_advice
"Last post totally blew up, wow thank you (and thank you mods!) this is the email I'm (24f) going to send to my ex (25m) after he came to me for help after getting another girl pregnant.","This is the email:

**Alex, since you asked me for help this is did advice I have for you:

1. Insist on a paternity test. This isn't to disparage you, the mother or your choices, but it's a smart thing to do.

2. Get ready to be a good dad. Whatever your relationship is with the mother, dedicate your life to being a positive role model to the innocent baby you've involved with your choices.

3. Get your medical insurance straightened out now. During my OB rotations at UMC I saw more stress and heartbreak than I thought was possible simply because couples didn't know what was and wasn't covered.

4. Start saving now for day care, school, college, etc... Your dad can recommend someone.

5. Don't contact me again. This was a pretty classless request but since you know I love babies and kids I couldn't help myself because I truly hope you understand how serious this is and you grow and rise to your choices. Kacie **


I took out all the stuff about him hurting me and crying everyday because while it's true, if gives him too much power and insight into my emotions. That was by far the most common insight on my last post (besides just ""fuck off""). I'm a nurse and I think the same thing that attracted me to my job is the same thing in my personality that can't just do nothing...so I'll give him practical advice (which I hope he is smart enough to know already) so I feel I've done ""my"" part and can be guilt free but also didn't give him a pound of my flesh to feed his ego. 


Happy for any more insight I'll send this in an hour or so...he called again last night but I didn't answer. After I send this I'll stop being a drama queen and Spotlight hog and move on...thank you for all the help.


Edit and last word on this since I want fo put it behind me:


**This is what I did send him: ""Alex, the only thing I can do to help you is say please be a good father to the innocent baby who had no say in this. Please don't contact me again.""** 

Hopefully it's simple, to the point and within his abilities. I'm going to resolve to have one last shitty day over this guy, go on a tinder date tomorrow.

Should I (F27) divorce my (M27) husband for getting a paternity test behind my back?,"My husband and I have been married for three years. We have a one-and-a-half-year-old son and I'm currently 6 months pregnant with our daughter.

When I met my husband, he was very shy and we didn't have the best relationship in the beginning. He'd constantly worry he wasn't good looking enough, tall enough, what-have-you. It was mostly due to his friends back then, who were (to put it nicely) Incels. They'd call me awful things and tell him worse, like that I couldn't be trusted because I had had boyfriends before him or that I was just using him for his money (although we earned about the same amount). And I think he genuinely believed it for a time - I don't know.

But when we got married, they started to shut up about it around me. I thought it was over with. That my husband and I could finally just live in peace. That they'd stop breaking him down with their accusations. I was wrong. A couple of months into my pregnancy with our son, he came up to me and said we needed to talk.

He wanted a paternity test.

I was heartbroken. I cried and yelled at him - asking if I'd ever done anything to make him think I was unfaithful, etc. Then he admitted that his friends had egged him on as to not get 'used by me'. He apologized but I felt so angry. I hated his friends and I hated him for asking, so I just gave him an ultimatum: We could drop the subject and I'd try not to hold it against him or he could get his paternity test and we'd divorce, because I didn't want to be married to a man that didn't trust me.

He chose the former and I honestly thought that was it. He broke off those friendships when our son was a couple of months old. But yesterday night, while he was in bed, I stumbled upon a shoebox he kept below his bookshelf in our office. I don't know why I decided to go snooping through it. I probably shouldn't have. I don't know, but I found the paternity test he had gotten behind my back. Surprise, surprise, it was his! Because of course it was...

I confronted him and he apologized, begging me to forgive him, saying that he wouldn't have done the same with our daughter, that he trusted me and that everything was different now, that he was different. I don't know if I can believe him anymore. All I can think about is about how he'd so effortlessly been lying to me all this time.

Honestly, I don't know what to do.

My (14f) girlfriend is being abused by her father and i really need help.,"I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons
Reasons and I do have her permission to post this.

I'm (15m) and I met my girlfriend 3 months ago, she has aspergers and is an incredibly sweet and amazing girl.

We met at a theatre group and when we finally admitted our feelings for eachother everything seemed fine, except for her over apologizing for everything.

When we met up for the first time outside the group we had talked on the phone for a while and she had said her dad was a bit harsh but I really had no idea how ""harsh"" that meant.

She told me her dad hit her and that was the first point that I got worried, I asked her if she ever thought about doing something about it and she told me not to worry.

Over our calls she tells me how she's made to feel shameful about basic things about growing up, being human and on top of that, emotionally abused to the point that she didn't feel human.

She also has multiple self harm scars from that time, but has currently stopped cutting herself.

At school she only has one friend who seems to a terrible friend and very manipulative/mean to her.

She's told me that essentially I'm the only one in her life that's genuinely nice to her.

She is worked to the bone because after 5 days of school she also has to attend a polish school and then have the theatre group leaving her with no days off at all.

It was at this point I became extremely worried.

Her family tells her she's fat when she's quite obviosily and in no uncertain terms, skinny.
I'm worried she could also develop body issues.

Here's where it gets bad though.
Today after having a lovely day together chilling and watching movies we lost track of time.

she was supposed to be home by 9pm and my mom thought that her parents were picking her up while we thought that my mom was taking us back so we thought that my mom would call us to go.
This didn't happen and by the time we realized it was already 9:02pm.

She called her parents and got picked up and I thought all was fine.

Obviously it wasn't.
She called me when she got home with tears in her eyes saying that we weren't allowed to see eachother anymore.

Later she texted me secretly telling me her dad screamed at her the whole way home and called her whore, slut, idiot, etc etc etc...
She then revealed that her whole family was told that she was a whore by her dad.

I finally ""snap"" at this point and suggest getting CPS (child protective services) involved.
She's hesitant as she has a hard time in new situations and is naturally nervous about possibly getting taken away.

I make the argument that either stay in the abusive home and possibly be further mentally scarred or be brave and take a chance for a better life.

She agrees and I ask her if there is anything else that her family has done to her for me to write up about to make a case.

The next part is so despicable that I don't recommend those who are easily saddened or disturb read further.

She tells me that her dad, when she was younger punched her in very sensitive spots, including her vagina.
And also that he ""accidentally"" walks in when she's dressing.
He gets physically close to her.
and undresses in her presence sometimes.

Also she told me that one time when she was self harming her dad caught her, and threw her across the room and mocked her.

When she cries she tells me she's also mocked by her dad.

She tells me that her mom and dad will hurt her if we stay together.

This is all I can remember.
Sorry for the grammar mistakes I wrote this in a hurry and in a rage.

As a moral person I cannot allow this to happen to someone I care about.

Please I need advice and if you can share this.

I'm deeply scared for her.

She told me that she's worried tonight her dad will hurt her while she sleeps.


Edit: I've given her the number of the childline and she says she will call it.
I've told her to find a place where she won't be heard so she's safe.

Edit 2: I've told my mom and I'm  following her advice.
I can't do much more tonight as my girlfriend's gone to bed

Edit 3: to all the people suggesting talking to a school counselor i'm homeschooled so I have no way of contacting the counselor.

I (28F)went through my BFs(26M) facebook messages. I screwed up bad. really bad.,"EDIT: Wow. I didn't expect this to blow up. I've been working a double so I have been unable to reply to responses as of yet. 

I'm obviously feeling incredibly overwhelmed, and I am not entirely sure how to reply, as I feel as though I will be absolutely crucified if I say anything other that ""Yes i will report my pedophile BF to the police asap."" 

As of this moment - I have taken photographs of the conversations, although disturbing and disgusting there is no incriminating evidence. But I do believe it is important to have documented. I'm still figuring out how to cope and what actions I'm going to take. 

Also. I have had a few people ask how long we have been together. That number is 2.5 years, and there have never been signs if this behaviour otherwise. Which is why it is such a shock the the system. 

He sent these messages around 5 years ago over the course of a couple months, and I have yet to find anything else since. 

My apologies I dont really know what else to say at this time. It has opened my eyes to how serious this really is and obviously I am in shock. 

.....................................................................................


My Bf was showing me pictures of his car he use to have a while ago. He was scrolling through old face book messages to find the photos. He goes back about 5 years ago, he finds the messages he was looking for. But along the way I notice all these messages to girls that started with the preview ""heyyy do I know you...."" etc.

Anyways. He uses one of my laptops, and his FB is always logged in. So because I'm a nosy horrible person (I fucked up, i know) I hopped on my computer when he wasn't around and scrolled back to the messages. There is literally 30+ messages of him (at the age of 21 - 22) messaging school girls between 14 - 16 asking if he's met them. Calling them gorgeous, and asking them for their numbers. Specifically asking how old they are. If they're still in school etc. I thought maybe once they gave their age he'd back off. But he didn't. It seemed to intrigue him more.

The conversations on messenger didn't seem to go anywhere... a lot of the girls seemed freaked out or responded with ""uhm, no sorry I'm 14 and I don't know you"". But a lot of them also exchanged numbers, so I can't see what happened further.

I don't know what to do. I know it was 5 years ago, but I can't look at him the same. WTF. This isn't cool right? 21 year olds messaging 14 year olds isn't a normal okay thing????

Our relationship has been great up until this point, so I'm assuming he's changed? I'm so mad at myself but going through the messages. But shit. What do I do? Yuck.",relationship_advice
I'm scared I won't find anyone because of my disability,"So first of all, I'm using a throwaway because this may just sound stupid and I don't want any of my online friends to know about my issue.

I'm 19, female. I had my tongue amputated for medical reasons when I was really young, but I'd like to avoid talking about that too much because it makes me uncomfortable. Naturally, because of this I can't speak. I know ASL & BSL but not many people I know do so yeah.

I'm worried this is going to affect my chances of finding a partner. I haven't ever had a bf/gf so far, and I work out to keep myself in shape and feel pretty confident in my looks. So, my main method of talking to people when they don't do sign is typing stuff on my phone and showing them. I understand this is possibly the worst thing possible impression wise and I don't know how to make things easier.

When the ""other"" sub removed my post and banned me for just asking why, I really thought I was going to lose my mind because my thoughts were racing a million miles a minute. A very, very sincere thank you. 

So if you recall from one of my updates, Nicky (wife) agreed that we would sit down with Gina (photographer) today and get her full side of the story. I spoke with her yesterday but that was only long enough for her to open the building, get her computer booted up and then get on the road for her shoot. 


I told my wife that I would like to talk to Gina alone at first and she said she had no problems with that. So Gina was very affable and friendly when we sat down at her desk. I asked her if she understood why I was having such a hard time with this. Gina basically said that she did and she was very, very sorry for the way things shook out. I asked her whats her version of ""shook out."" It more or less matched Nicki's version in that she had mentioned Nic shooting with the guy about a week prior to the boudoir shoot, Nic had said absolutely not. When the shoot day came they had an absolutely great time, Nicki suggested they do full nudes in what would be a Christmas present for me and Gina said Nicki was even more relaxed naked so she reintroduced the idea of shooting with her friend Craig (HotAbs McCool) Nicki said what the hell, lets do it. HotAbs McCool was in class, they drank wine while waiting for him and all were good and buzzed by the time he showed up. He brought his girlfriend who Gina has shot for some sort of collegiate volleyball all star thing and everyone was fast friends. Gina had the idea of making it like a visual romance novel where the hot business woman would succumb to HotAbs McCool's advances (mission accomplished). She said Nicki went from having a great time to being super nervous and Gina said she had to really press to get her to open up (pun intended? probably not...but I noticed the phrasing). But Nicki did very well so that's that. I asked her to promise me that there's no other pics, Gina said absolutely not that you can even look in the meta data if needed to see that everything is in a nice complete sequence that lasted about an hour. 

I asked Gina why Nicki, that if this guys girlfriend already knew how to do this, why not just use her (remember, GF did the same poses as Nic did while Nic was taking a break). Gina said she just loved shooting with Nicki and as a photographer, a series of sexy shots where the couple is ""mis-matched"" is much more interesting than just two good looking college kids. 


So that all seemed on the up and up (I mean it wasn't new news, I had heard that all before). Gina promised me that she wasn't going to do anything with the pictures and that it really was just a fun session with friends. I don't know what I was thinking but I asked if I could have a hard drive of all the pictures and Gina said that usually she would never do that, but because we had been friends for so long and the situation was so unique that I could. I have no idea why I asked for them, maybe I can embarrass Nicki with them some day as a prank as in ""hey remember that time you almost fucked that college kid? Here's a pic LOL...right?"" Just kidding I guess. 

Nicki came into the office crying apologizing to both of us, saying that it was her fault and she felt terrible about the whole thing. Gina was pretty contrite as well saying that she probably used her friendship with Nicki to push the moment way more than was professionally acceptable. I was able to half heartedly accept Gina's apology, but I'm just not sure I'm to understanding it yet. 


So we left, Nicki again begged me not to make any rash decisions about our future. I told her that I'd already said if everything up to this point was the truth, than I'm not leaving but I can't make any promises as to what ""normal"" will be for us now. She said that was ok and recommended that we seek a marriage counselor, I told her that would be great and I'd make every session. 

She has been a pretty big emotional wreck since she got home on Saturday and I don't think she's slept at all (I haven't). She's been trying very hard to be physical with me with things like holding my hand, hugging me, sitting next to me on the couch and that sort of thing...I've been trying to reciprocate but having a very hard time with it. I know she's hurting and I should be the one to comfort her and I'm doing the best I can. 

Here's the thing which a lot of you may disagree with (and that's fine), I feel that if i'm going to stay in this marriage than I need to stay in the marriage 100%. I'm not going to be her warden, I'm not going to ask her to prove where she is or who she's hanging out with and I'm not going to look through her phone. I felt gross doing it yesterday (though it was helpful) and I couldn't bring myself to do it again. I feel that if we're married, then we're married. This isn't something to be brought up in an argument, a ""what about that time you..."" type thing or an excuse or me to go out and creep on hot Instagram girls. If I'm staying, I'm staying 100%. I can't say with certainty that I can force myself to stick to this because Nicki can be a nag from hell and the temptation to pull up a photo and say ""why didn't I remember to get gas? remember that time HotAbs McCool's 9 inch dick was only separated from your ass by fabric?""  may be too much to resist.  (yeah, still got a little spite in me).

But that last crack aside, she's been through a lot and the mother of my adorable little kid deserves love and compassion, even if ""a lot' has been of her own making. So I'm going to go see a movie tonight without her, be mad, call her all sorts of names in my head, scream, punch my steering wheel, throw rocks into the river, have some scotch, get in a bar fight...whatever. Then tomorrow I'm getting up and I'm going to be the husband I was before she left last Sunday. 

I'm also going to hit facebook, gym up and delete a lawyer (wasn't my line but whoever said it on one of the posts really made me laugh). But seriously, in addition to Nicki messing up, this little episode has shown me that I've become a squishy 50 year old despite the fact that I'm 30. A huge reason Nicki and Gina didn't even think to ask me to participate in that shoot is that I don't even resemble a guy who could be with my wife anymore. She's very attractive and while I've got a decent base to work with, I'm not anymore. She looks better than she did in the wedding pictures Gina took for us, I look far worse. So if I'm going to be in this marriage 100%, I need to also be 100% myself or the person I was when I was a practicing purple belt in BJJ or a walk on to my college baseball team. That's been the hardest (but probably the most productive) part of this whole situation is to have to look myself in the mirror and admit...your wife did a softcore porn shoot and while she still loves you, you've let yourself go so bad that she didn't even think to include you. 


So I've already signed back up for BJJ tomorrow and I'm going to talk to my professor about being an instructor again, I'm going to join Nicki in her paleo craziness and maybe even her funky ass MovNat class. Hopefully use this episode to make myself a better person. 


Thank you so much for sticking with me...and a serious thank you again. 


Edit 1 in the morning...so this has been such a crazy experience and I've seen the absolute best and worst of Reddit. From god awful power hungry mods, red pillers, Incels , Pervs and edge lords. But also some truly helpful people who genuinely seemed to care about a stranger and his wife, whether they agreed with his course of action or not. PMs and comments are still rolling in and I'll keep responding if people are interested in my nonsense. 

Just to put this to rest from the PMs, I'm not sharing the pics, I'm not linking ginas page. You're going to have to take my word for it that Nicky is as cute as I say. If you had to do that old game of ""what celebrity do you resemble?"" There's a porn star named Lana Rhodes that has striking resemblance to her face (ironic?). Nic has black hair and striking blue eyes, fit now and not super curvy but balanced If that makes sense. For those who keep asking, that's the best I'm going do, and yes I'm bragging that my wife is quite hot. I look like smashed shit served on a cracker but self esteem is at an all time low and I'm hung over like crazy and uber is taking forever and I have to get my car and still get to work and I'm at least 2 hours late now...I'm going to close the door to my office and sleep this off. Have a good one everyone. ",relationship_advice
I (21F) am stuck in Paris due to my tinder date (30M) because he decided to have sex with other women while we were there.,"So, I met this cute guy on Tinder and we hit it off quite well.


After a couple of months of meeting up and ""dating"" he decided to bring me to Paris. It was beautiful, but something felt off. He was gone a lot at nights and came back to the hotel around 2 AM every night. It turns out he was having sex with a French girl he met on Tinder. When confronting him about this he decided to say we would talk about it in the morning.

I fell asleep and when I woke up he was gone. He had taken a cab to the airport and bought a ticket from someone most likely. (He was quite wealthy)

So now, I (21F) am stuck in Paris, alone, with not enough money.",relationship_advice
"Every night my (34F) husband (34M) takes one of our 3 children (1,3,4) for a two-hour drive. Should I be worried?","*UPDATE FOR CLARITY: I have tracked his GPS a few times.  They never lead to the same place but he usually is stopped for 1/2 an hour.   I went on google maps and don't recognize the places he's stopped at.  They aren't near anything special like a Grocery Store, Target, Fast Food.*     


My husband and I have been together for 10+ years. At times he can be weird in an only child way, but he's a very good guy.  And a hard worker.

&#x200B;

As our kids are close to going to bed, he's been saying that he wants to take one of them out for a drive.  We have a newborn that is teething , and sometimes it can be hard for the kids to sleep if she's crying.  And sometimes it can be hard if they're running around and she's trying to sleep (our 3 year old has a sensory disorder & 4 year old is on the spectrum.  It's more complex than the following but when I explained everything the 3 year old has a form of hyperactivity that is similar to ADHD and the 4 year old has Aspergers but neither can be diagnosed this early according to our doctors )   .

&#x200B;

The drives can last for 2-4 hours.

&#x200B;

But lately, I feel like he's been in his own head.  Not really talking after he gets home. I'm not sure if I'm stressing him out or doing something wrong. There's nothing that is glaring in terms of problems we might have outside of the normal financial stress of having 3 kids.

&#x200B;

I talked to the four year old last week to see what he & his father did on their drive.  He said just drive and talk until he went to sleep. I asked if they walked anywhere or left the car and he said no they just kept driving.

On Monday I asked the four year old where he & daddy went.  He said that they went to a building.  Not a house.  Not a store. A building.    My husband works from a converted garage behind our home so it's not his office.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday I asked my 3 year old the same question.  She said they stopped near an airport to watch airplanes (this is a small private airport for amateur pilots).

I just asked my husband what they did on their drive and he said that he just drive until the kid falls asleep.  He doesn't want them to get out of the car because the point is for them to go into a relaxing sleep.  I said that our 3 YO talked about an airport and he paused and said that maybe she was dreaming about it. Or saw a plane.

I'll be the first to admit I have trust & control issues ( I didn't grow up with a dad, let alone a good one)..  We've never had any issues in our marriage, but part of me worries if this is a sign of someone having an affair.  Maybe he waits for the kids to sleep to call someone? Or maybe he's being nice so I can go to sleep faster.",relationship_advice
My [29F] husband [27M] confessed to me that he very nearly committed murder when he was a kid,"We've been married six years. We have a four year old girl and one year old twins. My husband's never been anything but kind and loving to me and our babies.

Only a few days ago we were doing some cleaning, as we have guest staying for a little while. In one of his many containers of junk I found a box of rifle ammunition. We don't keep guns in the house. I'm not rabidly anti-gun or anything, but I don't like them and we've never even discussed having them around.

I questioned him and he kind of froze up, because there really was no good explanation. He doesn't own any guns. He never goes hunting or anything or target shooting. He kind of sputtered and told me it was a 'joke' gift from a friend. It was obvious bullshit, but I didn't push it.

I really had a sinking feeling about the bullets. I asked him again that night, and he snapped at me and told me to forget about it.

Over the next few days, he got a bit cold and distant and short with me. Finally I confronted him about it again, knowing it was about the bullets. He yelled at me. He never yells at me. We actually had a big fight, and it was clear something was *seriously* wrong.

Finally, he told me the truth. I got the sense he'd wanted to tell *someone* for a while from the way it just poured out once he admitted it.

He admitted to me that when he was 17-18, he and his best friend planned to shoot up their high school. It was clear this wasn't idle fantasizing, but that they made thorough, detailed plans on how to murder as many of their classmates as possible. They acquired guns (legally, as it was, since his friend had just turned 18). They never got around to building the bombs they wanted, but he said they fully intended to, and had the schematics all worked out.

In short, they planned to bomb the school, gun down as many survivors as possible, and then kill themselves.

A few weeks ahead of 'the Day', his friend got paranoid her parents were onto her. They got cold feet. They panicked, burned all of the journals and detailed plans they'd worked out. They destroyed all evidence. He said his friend sold off the guns over the next years after graduation. Except, he said, he kept one box of the ammunition they'd collected, as a 'memento' of his 'friendship' which ended pretty soon after that.

I was in shock. Utter shock. I wanted him to tell me he was joking. He said he wasn't. It had been weighing on him for the past ten years, and he wanted to get it off of his chest, he said.  I didn't know what to say. The thought that he could ever be capable of something like this is utterly horrifying. It made me sick to think about. He begged me not to think about it too much, and that it was a long time ago, and he was a stupid kid, and he was glad he could 'trust' me with this. He says he would never in a million years consider doing anything like that now, and he doesn't know what possessed him in those days. I told him I agreed it was a 'long time ago'.

But I'm not over it. I don't know that I ever can be. I'm having a hard time looking at him, even, and I can see that he knows it's still gnawing at me. I don't know what to do. When I see him holding one of our kids I get this pit in my stomach. I still love him. He's been nothing but good to me all our relationship.

But part of me wonders if everything since then has been some kind of mask. If he's capable of planning something like that for so long, what does that say about him? Is the sort of thing someone can really come to regret?

TL;DR: my husband admitted he almost committed a school shooting when he was younger. Is this something I can get past? Should I even try?",relationship_advice
"My wife cheated during her bachelorette party , im heartbroken and confused.","Me and my wife have been together 6 years married for about 2, last night one of her close friends who she had a falling out with recently told me about how my wife got really drunk during her party and ended up sleeping with some guy.

My (21) Boyfriend (22) is going out for dinner with a girl he met at a party.,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 and a half years. 

Back in August of 2018, my boyfriend and I went to my best friend's  birthday party. It was pretty small (10 or so people). We both met this girl (a co-worker of my best friend), who didn't know anyone else there.

At the party, my boyfriend and her were talking quite a bit, and i was with them for a lot of the night and we got along well, but since i was close with a lot of people there i obviously had conversations with other people there. Whereas my boyfriend and her were not close to most of the people there and therefore talked more.

I was super happy that my boyfriend was being outgoing and talkative because he can be a bit asocial at parties. And didn't think anything of them talking a lot, other then ""yay he's having fun!!"" lol.

In December of 2018, the girl reaches out to my boyfriend on instagram (she got both of our instagrams back in August) and asks him to meet up for lunch to catch up, and they go back and forth about saying how much they got along and how they feel like they could be really good friends/how they don't wanna miss out. He showed me the first few messages. And i found it weird how expressive they were about how much they liked each other even though they were only talking for a few hours, much of the time with other people, including myself.

I haven't looked at his texts, but she does text him late at night some times, and he never replies to her when i'm there. I don't want to cross that line, but honestly I feel tempted to.

I talked to him about it a few times saying i'm uncomfortable about them meeting up/that its weird. Like several months after meeting for a few hours..My best friend thinks its weird too.

Its just weird, and i'm uncomfortable. They are planning to meet up and it just makes my heart really heavy and sad. 

He also told me yesterday that he told her I was uncomfortable with him and her getting along. Which i felt was kinda a slap in the face because he has admitted that its weird, but kinda put me in a bad light (then later said he said it in a joking way). Every time I bring it up he talks about when i go out with friends in a group and a guy is there, even though I have always been 100% faithful and never been shady, and never wanted to meet up with someone i met at a party alone.

He has had a past which has made it hard for me to trust him. He texted his ex asking to hang out 2 days before he asked me to be his ""official"" girlfriend (we were seeing each other exclusively for 3 months before). And also was being extremely flirty (talking about sex, thongs etc) a few months into our relationship over text with one of his friends ex girlfriends. 

This is a whole mess lmao, im kinda all over the place, just wanna know if this is like normal and if i should get over it. 


TL;DR - Bf is meeting up with a woman we met briefly at a party. Woman dmed him 4 months on instagram after first meeting.

Abandoned by all,"I'm 50 years old. Older than a lot of participants on this site. I come here to seek relief. Most people at my workplace think I'm happy. The truth is I'm nothing but unhappy. Exactly 3 years ago, my wife of 24 years deserted me. With her left our son. Like most couples there were disagreements. However a step as drastic as this one was inconceivable to me.


 It turns out that my close friend was the one who brought a schism in our relationship. Who do I trust? Next I'm dismissed from work. I've lost not only most of my savings settling the divorce case but also the will to live. Who or what do I live for? People advised me to visit medical professionals. I did. Their treatment was ineffective.



I'm told that I should be happy with myself before seeking the company of others. I don't give a rat's ass about such hackneyed remarks. Only those who've gone through this phase will be able to comprehend how painful it is.

Every night when I go to bed I pray for a reunion of my family. I know it's improbable. Even while I write this I've a feeling my heart is going to burst open. That sinking feeling. I'm a living corpse. I know that I'm the only one who'll have to bear this. Sometimes it feels good to write what you're feeling.

UPDATE: My (25F) roommate has been hiding her pregnancy from me (32F) because she knows I don't want to live with kids and she does not want to move out,"Prevous Post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b38ca1/my\_25f\_roommate\_has\_been\_hiding\_her\_pregnancy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b38ca1/my_25f_roommate_has_been_hiding_her_pregnancy/)

About a month ago I posted about my preggers roommate who knows I'm not a kid person. I came here to see if I was the jerk for not wanting to deal with it. This post garnered more attention than I expected but I wanted to thank you all for sharing your thoughts. It was truly divided between people who thought I was the jerk and people who thought I was in the right. I gave me a lot to think about.

After sitting on it for a few days, I contacted a local lawyer in my area and got a free hour of advice. She told me to go over my lease contract again and check all the fine print. It was good that she did because I found a clause that states I have to have all tenants on my lease even if they are temporary. I broke that rule by not putting my roommate on the lease. I had a meeting with my landlord and admitted my mistake. He said I didn't really break any laws by not having my roommate on the lease but Betty needed to come in and prove her income can sustain her and another person (her unborn baby) before they can add her. No big, right?

The result? Betty now knows she can't afford a baby. She has to apply for welfare if she wants to keep it so she moved back home (to another state) with her parents.

TL;DR - Betty moved out and back home with her mom. I AM the asshole for pushing it as far as I did. But I found a new roommate (19F) who is on the lease and who has no desire for kids for another five years at least. Betty is clearly better off with a support system at home and even emailed me a tiny picture of some white blurry thing with a big head that she called her son. It was gross.

Edit: Look -  I'm not a baby hater I just like them better out of the womb. Example - I like sex but I don't like unsolicited dick pics. Those are gross. That doesn't make me a man-hater either.",relationship_advice

Every morning I wake up hours before him and every night we go to bed at the same time. I'm exhausted, sleep deprived, and depressed.

(Our leases ended at different times and now he's month to month), clearly he has no plans on moving anymore and clearly doesn't want to. He claims he does want to move, but can't afford it yet. Months ago when we were planning, he never said it would be a problem. 

I do all the cleaning and shopping. I've asked him to split groceries and stuff with me and he never manages to actually give me the money or says he has to wait till he gets paid. Now I'm kinda tight on money which gives me anxiety. 

He plays video games all day while I work all day. He complains we don't have sex enough and that I work too much. He's annoyed when I go to bed early. 

I get home an hour after him (and leave for work like 4-6 hours before him). He complains about his job and says he's tired from work or that his job is so hard, I listen and support him. But when I talk about work he gets mad and says all I ever do is talk about work. And again says I work too much. So I don't mention it anymore.

I've asked him for help, nothing comes of it. I've told him I'm depressed, he has nothing to say. 

I love him so so so much, and I love his/our puppy so so much, it's breaking my heart to write this post. Especially since seeing it written out is making it hard to keep lying to myself.

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for all your responses, insight, and support. I'm trying to get through all the comments and messages (busy of course haha). I feel so much more empowered and validated, I can't even express how grateful I am! I slept well last night and even slept in a little this morning, I feel much calmer and more centered.

I haven't decided how exactly I'm going to handle this. One day at a time for now, focusing on myself more, and hopefully cutting back on the hours in a couple weeks when this project I'm overseeing gets done.

He and I have made a little progress, yesterday I was able to express how I cannot and will not keep working myself like this, with both work and at home. I asked him if he could help me with a few things and do some stuff around the house. To my surprise, he did everything and more! I think trying to clearly express exactly what needs to be done made things a lot easier and was easier for him to execute. 

Here's to hoping things get better! And to feeling empowered enough to know I'll be okay if they don't. I used to be so focused and independent and I'm excited to reel some of that back in.

So much love for everyone in this community. <3",relationship_advice
It's my[40M] fault my wife [37F] killed herself and now I'm reminded of her everyday through our kids and cruel messages.,"Sorry if this post doesn't seem to fit on here. I am new to reddit and I was told by a very close friend that this is how she stayed sane through her partners infidelity. I will try and keep this short with as much detail as possible and advice would be helpful. 

My wife committed suicide 2 years ago, one of the biggest reasons for this is because of my infidelity. I had an emotional affair with her best friend for over a year. My wife and I were together for 20 years, we were both each other's first with sex, holidays, living together you name it we did it all together. We had three children together, 2 boys and a girl. We had the most incredible relationship, we were each other's best friends, we didn't have many big arguments before the kids, we did everything to keep each other happy. We only ever thought about each other. 

My wife was the most beautiful woman I had ever met, the way her eyes glistened and her smile was incredible. After all the time we had spent together she was still the only one who kept me sane and every time I looked at her it felt like my heart was glowing. She was truly the most incredible woman. Everything about her and everything that happened with her was perfect. 

After 5 years together we had our first child, after 7 years we welcomed our wonderful second child and on our 10 year anniversary she told me we was expecting a third. Unfortunately, at the time we was expecting our third, she had told me that it was not my child and that she had a random one night stand one night while I was away for work and she had gone out with her friends while her mum looked after our children. I was absolutely distraught. My heart had broke and I couldn't believe she would do this. However. I am a firm believer that people can change and that sometimes even the best of people can make a mistake. I forgave her. We talked about it and I understood her point of view she had only ever been with me, didn't have a crazy teenage life and we had children rather young so she hadn't experienced much of life. Even though I shouldn't have forgiven her I did and for a couple of years things were incredible, it was like it used to be. We watched our children grow up through school, took them on holiday, started driving lessons with our eldest, had family dinners and did a lot of things together. 

But for some reason, after 15 years together she started getting some rather strange trust issues with me. She was accusing me of cheating and broke up with me maybe once every 3 months or so because of my 'strange' behaviour, I must say that at this point I wasn't doing anything wrong it was only after 18 year anniversary that I had betrayed her. After a rough 3 years, we had no sex life, she had practically stopped any contact at all we wouldn't text, eat together, have phone calls, sit next to each other. In general I felt like a house guest rather than a partner. 

She had a new friend, she was younger, she was 27 and I was 36, they had met at work and one night she came round for dinner with her partner and me and her hit it off. We had some kind of chemistry just from looking at one another, I did not pursue this. I was messaged by her friend first and from there we hit it off, we were messaging in secret, and I quite genuinely believe we fell in love over time. 

After a year of back and forth messages, my wife had found out. She couldn't believe I had done this and that she loved me so much. This was heart breaking because the moment I saw her crying I felt nothing, no sadness, no remorse, nothing at all. It was almost as if I had lost every feeling for my wife after all this time. I couldn't apologise all I did was blame her for driving me to this and that I wanted to avenge her somehow for what she had put me through. She told me to leave so I stormed out and met my wife's friend in which on this one occasion we engaged in sexual intercourse. 

After I had calmed down, I needed to go home to pick up my stuff and make sure my wife was ok. When I got home the kids weren't home, they had gone to their grandmas as I soon found out on a note left on the downstairs coffee table. I walked upstairs and there she was. * TRIGGER ⚠️ WARNING* she had hung herself. I will never to this day forget her face and I broke down. My heart shattered and I couldn't face what I had just done to her. She had cuts on her arms, legs from where she had self harmed and she was just hanging there. This was the most traumatic experience of my life and I can't seem to type any more of what happened right now my head is reliving this day. 

The post mortem determined that she had high traces of Tylenol in her system, and the doctor said this hadn't succeeded so she must have tried self harming and then when all else failed hung herself. 

Skip 2 years later, the kids haven't been in contact with me because they believe I murderer their mother and I receive messages from them on a daily basis telling me they wish it was me instead. 

I have no idea what to do, I can't unlive this day and what I did. I just wish I could go back and change what I did and it would all be different. 

I know this is a tragic story and the majority of you will believe it is my fault but if you could please offer me some advice on how to fix my relationship with my children and how to move forward this would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
How do I get them all to back off?,"My wife Sarah died 6 years ago when we were 29.  We'd been together 6 years, married for 1.  She died in a car accident on a ""girl's day out"" with her sister and 2 friends. Her sister and one friend survived. Sarah and one friend died.

Initially people understood my grief. Most were also grieving. After about 2 years people started to suggest I should be trying to ""move on"" and see other women.  After a while all my family and friends (with one exception) are saying it. Even my wife's parents are suggesting it. I never thought that would happen.

I know they are all doing it out of love but they don't understand how I feel. I have tried to explain it but it's not sinking in. I will NEVER get over losing Sarah.

I went for several grief counselling sessions 3 months after I lost her and again after 2 years. I understand that it's normal for the grief to ease and for the person to eventually move on. I just don't think that will happen to me.

I've improved. When it first happened I couldn't function. I thought the pain would kill me. I don't know how I got through the funeral. The idea of burying her, of putting her in the ground, on her own, was unbearable. I wanted to be buried with her. I just wanted to die with her. I didn't do anything but cry.

After about 7 months and the end of the first grief counselling sessions I got to a point where I could live through my days, do my job, eat, keep myself clean. That was all I could do.

After about 2 years I started to go out for basic social things. Family events, drinks with friends or colleagues etc.

That's when the suggestions started. People were trying to set me up or saying I should date. The number of people saying it and the forcefullness has increased. Some seem to have taken it on as a challenge. 

How do I get them to understand? I'll never get over Sarah. She was perfect for me. She was so funny and bright and loving and we matched in every way. I can't describe how happy we were together.

I have accepted that she has been stolen from me but I know I will never meet anyone I can love like that. It wouldn't be fair on another person to even try. I'd always have Sarah on my mind.

I've talked to plenty of women when I've been out with friends. I've had about 15 women ask me out over the last few years. They have been mostly attractive, funny, warm women but I only want Sarah.

They are never going to be Sarah, so I don't want to try. Nobody seems to get it. The only person who doesn't do it is Sarah's sister. She comes over 2 or 3 times each week. She was driving the car and survived the accident. I think she is too consumed with guilt to be trying to set me up with someone. The accident wasn't her fault but she still tortures herself and I have to set her straight. She is the only person not trying to persuade me to see other people. 

It doesn't help that the husband of the other girl who died in the accident has already remarried. Good for him. I'm different.

How do I get them to stop trying? How do I explain it without being too harsh with them all? I know they mean well but I need them to stop.

TLDR - Lost my wife in an accident and I can't get my family and friends to stop pushing me to date.

**Update** - Thank you all for the support and advice.  I've had several very good suggestions that do exactly what I need. Firm but without upsetting people who mean well.  As far as dating is concerned many people suggested changing ""never"" to ""not yet"". Friends and family will accept that.   (Thanks to /u/K-braithwaite and so many others  who suggested a version of that)  

One thing has come up that I wasn't expecting.  It became very clear to me while I was reading all the replies that **I should be doing more work on me** and less on others.     ( thanks to almost  everyone).    

With that in mind:   

I'm going to start therapy in October. (Thanks to /u/Lizam24 and all the others who made me realize I need it)

I've approached 2 online grief support groups     (thanks to /u/Quilt1974)   

And one group to meet in person     (thanks to /u/LadySushi)   

Sorry to those who said this made them cry. So sorry.",relationship_advice
Update: I think my husband cause our neighbor to commit suicide,"Hello, everyone. Considering the flood of messages and responses I have received, I decided that I would put out a response as soon as I had gotten myself together. I hope to answer a few questions and give you a bit more information on what has happened. 

Why did I let my husband take the money? 
I did not know how much she gave my husband until he came back to the backyard. I would have told him to give it back if she'd still been in the neighborhood but she'd driven off. 

Why/what did your husband tell the father? 
My husband is a military man with very strong morals. He believed that helping her lie to her father was morally wrong. He tried to return the money to her father and told him that his daughter hit our fence, paid for it and asked us not to tell him but because we had the supplies, he was looking to return the money and get him updated on the situation. The father did not accept the money and ""slammed"" the door shut. 

Why didn't you notice anything was wrong?
My husband and I are Catholics in a predominantly Mormon neighborhood. We are mostly ignored. Up until a few days ago, we hadn't spoken to more than a few neighbors besides in passing and knew nothing about their home or family lives. We have never been around children and took her crying for normal teenage hysterics. 

Did you tell the police?
Yes. I called the non-emergency line this morning and told the operator about what I knew since my husband was afraid they might arrest him for not reporting what he saw. They did not ask to take my statement down at the station but said they would ""look into it"". The funeral is in a few days and we are not invited. I donated a few hundred dollars to a charity chosen by the mother that her daughter supported and will be picking up their younger sons from school in a few hours. 

My husband and I are looking to book separate appointments with a counselor nearby. I do not know if I blame him for her death but it has brought some things to light that make me very nervous. He called our lawyer to see if he could be held liable before telling me what happened, tried to hide that he knew the girl was dead, and generally acted in bad faith. It is a culmination of everything I dislike about him and I do not know how to move forward.

No, I do not know how she died and I am not going to ask.

I'm a female born without a vagina. How do I tell a guy that I'm interested in about it?,"I'm not too sure where to post this but the MRKH subreddit is very dead, so I guess I'll give this a shot??

I have MRKH syndrome. Basically meaning I was born with without a vagina, vaginal canal, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes. This makes me unable to have sex, and unable to have children.
 
I met a guy on a dating app about a week ago and we've been texting since. I've been super busy with school, volunteer work, and meetings, so we haven't actually met in person yet. We spoke on the phone once so far while he was walking home from work at 3am (he's a bartender). He's really funny, and I feel like he gets me. We've set up a coffee date for Wednesday and I'm really looking forward to it. 

So far, he's definitely shown interest in me, saying things like how hes been crushing on me or how he thinks I'm really sweet and lovely. I don't want to get ahead of myself but I feel the same way back. This is the first time I've ever connected with someone this way on a dating app! 

I'm excited but at the same time I'm also VERY nervous. He's very honest and blunt about things and I feel that I need to reciprocate that. A lot of doctors and therapists say that there's no 'right time' to discuss it, only when you feel comfortable. Although that's true, I dont want either of us to be invested in the other before having the chance to talk about it. So I guess my question is how long should I wait before telling him? Would it be too much if I told him on our first date? I mean, for all I know maybe he won't even be interested in me after meet in person. But at the same time if he is, I'm not trying to scare him away...

And a follow up question, how do I begin to tell him?? Maybe a funny way to approach it? Or a good conversation starter that could lead the conversation towards my condition? I've told one guy before and that didn't go to well. I waited a month to tell him and I ended up crying while doing it. He was interested in me before I told him but afterwards, he was only interested in being FWB. My self-esteem definitely took a kick with that one. 

Any advice would be good really. Thanks.

Update: Woke up to my (20M) girlfriend (24F) on top of me and I don't know how to deal with it.,"Update after this post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cseu41/_/

Thanks for the guidance last time. It helps. Though the situation turned out a little different than expected. I did talk with her when she came home, and she was super anxious thinking she did something horrible. We talked it out. So apparently I've been the one initiating in the middle of the night. I start feeling her up (sometimes waking her up in the process..) and she takes the lead afterwards. Now she opened up to me about some bedroom issues I wasn't aware of. For the past few months I haven't been initiating much (like 9/10 times she is) and I never realized this was taking a toll on her mental. So when I was feeling her up in the middle of the night she was all for it and happy that I was taking the initiative, basically taking any sex she can get. Looking back I never really initiate because I'm kinda tired after the gym and my muscles are sore. But I go to the gym 6x a week and almost every evening she ends up coming onto me, and once it starts I'm into it but it hurts her I was never coming onto her. And it's definitely not a lack of attraction, I made that very clear and comforted her. We agreed that I will be initiating more, but more importantly I assured her it has nothing to do with her looks. And when I start feeling her up in the middle of the night she can either properly wake me up or just go with it. 

I realized if she's enjoying it it doesn't really matter because I apparently sleep through the entire act until 2 days ago haha. And if she wants a session that's a bit more 'active' she will wake me up which I'm OK with. I deeply care for her and I feel like shit for not really taking her feelings into consideration. But hopefully we have things worked out now. Thanks everyone.",relationship_advice
Situation with girl (30f) I (30M) used to bully,"I have been here for a bit without posting or commenting and am looking for advice

When I was younger I was a different person. There was a girl I went to middle and high school with and bullied very hard, physically and emotionally. There was one incident where the cops got involved and the only reason I wasn't expelled/arrested was because there was not proof. After that incident I did not see this girl for many years.

In my early 20's I was sent to prison for 3 years for assaulting a man. Another thing I am deeply ashamed of. When in prison I introspected deeply and found sanctuary in religion. I left a better man than I went in.

A few weeks ago I ran into the girl on the street of my home town. Before that my pastor had told me to ask those who I have wronged for forgiveness. My heart sunk when I saw her and I could tell she was avoiding eye contact. I called her name and we started talking. We talked about things for a long time, and she seemed ok/smiling. Eventually I was going to leave things as they were, but she asked if I would like to get coffee. At the moment and even now I feel like denying her request would not be fair given our past.

We got coffee and ended up sleeping together, it felt great and there wasn't much moral question as it was happening. She left the next morning and we have been texting/meeting regularly since. 
I am not on social media but I googled her name. Her Facebook picture is her in a dress with another man. I was not 100% but it looks like she is wearing a wedding ring as well. I casually asked a high school friend who uses Facebook if she is married without giving too much away, and he said yes

My head hurts typing this because I feel as though I am being tested but don't know what to do. If she is cheating I don't know if I should tell her husband or just ask to break things off without letting her know I know, if I do that she will resent me forever I'm sure",relationship_advice
"My best friend (20/M) at the time broke off our friendship 2 years ago because he said I (22/M) made him question his sexuality, and it still kills me everyday","So, to start, we were completely best friends. To the point that during school, or sports, or anything else, we were pretty inseparable. Our friendship came so easy from the start back in middle school. We started out as baseball teammates and close neighbors back in 2009 or so. Gradually we became closer and closer friends. Eventually it got to the point where we were literal BFF's, as silly as it sounds. We were always teased in high school and by buddies because we were like a power couple of best friends. We did pretty much everything together, but it was always platonic as we dated girls in high school and did our own thing. It got to the point where his family called me their adopted son because I was over so often, and same with him. We both basically got adopted into each other's families because we spent so much time with each other. 

Every weekend we would plan what we would do, and make sure it was always coordinated together. If he wanted to hang out at another friend's house he'd always ask me if I wanted to go, and vice versa. We were as close as friends could be, I assume. Eventually I had a fallout with my family and his mom offered their spare room to me to stay while I figured stuff out (mind you I was 17 and a new senior in high school, and he was 15 going into his sophomore year). For the next year and a half I basically lived with him and his family. It got to a point where we just called each other brothers and not friends anymore. 

For the time I lived with him we got even closer. He knew everything about me, and I knew everything about him. Our friends joked that he was dating me as much as he was dating his girlfriend. At the time is was a joke, because neither one of us had any interest in actually dating because we both were straight. Well I graduated and moved to a different city for school, and we kept in touch basically 24/7 still. From the minute we got up to the minute we went to bed we were always texting, snapchatting, or something, just to stay in contact. 

But to my surprise when I started my sophomore year of college and he was a senior in high school, out of nowhere he asked me if it was ok to step back and move out. And I was pretty shocked, because for the last 5 years we basically were brothers and best friends, but because I cared for him and what he thought I agreed, but asked why. And his response was that our relationship had gotten to a point with him that he didn't know what he wanted. He said I started to make him question his sexuality because our friendship started to feel like dating without any physical things. He said he still loved the friendship but needed to take a break and figure things out. 

Well, it's been 2 years now and I still miss our friendship. I will occasionally look back on all the screenshots I have of our conversations, or snapchats, and re-live some of my favorite memories as a kid/teenager. I don't know what to do, because the longer it goes the more I miss our friendship. We have very little contact since then, usually a once in a few months quick text. I want to text him that I miss our friendship, but since he's the one who broke it off, I feel like he needs to initiate it, but might not want to. I don't want to date him, I just want my best friend back and I have no clue how to walk this line. 

**TL;DR – Best friend of 7 years broke off our relationship because he felt that our relationship made him question his sexuality, and I miss our friendship more and more but don't know how to initiate any talk with him about it now that it's 2 years removed from the situation.**",relationship_advice
I (36M) found out that my wife (35F) of 10 years has been cheating on me from the past 2 years.,"I've been married for 10 years. My wife and I have 2 kids. I'm more of a freelance writer so I stay at home while my wife has a regular 9-5 job.
We both use the same laptop (important for later) for non-work purposes. Today, I felt like checking up my FB. When I went on the website, I saw that my wife (let's call her W) 's account was opened. She must have forgotten to log out in a hurry. I promptly went on to log out of her account, but just then a message popped up. I opened it out of curiosity (it was a guy, I couldn't resist). And my whole came crashing down. The message was- ""Hey! Excited for today ;p"". I scrolled up their msgs, and died a bit every time. Nudes, sexts, weekend plans, making plans to avoid me and the kids, everything you don't want your wife doing with another man. And this supposedly started about 6 months after she gave birth to our second child.
Although we've been married for 10 years, I've loved this woman since I was 18. I'm crushed and numb and have bawled my eyes out. I msged her when she was coming home and she replied that she had to work overtime today. I can't even look at her anymore, but I don't know what'd happen to the kids. I feel like dying. Please advice me on what to do. I've printed out the copies of the entire chats of 2 years. I've lost all hope and thinking capacity to come up with my next course of action. This seemed the only place I could share. I request you to please help me out here.
EDIT : I'm really thankful to all of you guys! She came home a few minutes ago, all tired and drunk. Said one of her Co workers gave them a farewell party. Will keep you updated. Thanks for the support, really. ",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I (24M) have had a huge crush on her (23F). It was very obvious. Now I just found out she's been dating my sister (22F).,"December 14th, 2018. A day that will live in infamy. This is an update to [this here post that I put up a few days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a6ht2z/i_24m_have_had_a_huge_crush_on_her_23f_it_was/) To summarize, I inadvertently found out that a girl I had expressed obvious interest in had been dating my sister, and immediately entered a crisis lockdown mode. Since then, I've been working to address the situation. I think I can safely say without exaggeration that these have been the most consequential hours in the history of the human race.

Since a few people wanted an after-action report once the whole thing was finished, here's a summary I've made now that the dust is cleared.

**DAY 1, 19:00 HOURS -- ""A SHADOW OF A DOLT""**

After a few hours of packing, reading responses to the thread, and stalling, I decided to make my first move. I abandoned my original plan to fake my death after I couldn't figure out how to falsify the dental records, and settled on Plan B: act like a human being and confront the situation head on. I started for home and arrived not long after.

First impressions were good. My whole family was there to greet me, with lots of the usual hugs and jokes. Thankfully, while I was definitely freaking out when I was venting to strangers on the internet in my first post, I managed to keep it together when in real life, and acted pretty much normal. So, there was a lot of laughing, exchanging stories about what I'd been doing at school, and promises to walk the dog. Immediately my worst fear -- that my parents and brother were in the know about the awkward situation I was in -- pretty much evaporated, since they were actually no different from usual. All was fine, *EXCEPT* for one thing out of place: *the sister in question today.*

She's there too, which was a relief. However, she's also the only one not joking around or trading stories. Instead, she seems sad and withdrawn, which really isn't like her at all. Obviously that's a cause for concern even if I didn't have this whole mess lurking at the back of everything. At the same time, however, I also know that she's still in the middle of finals, so she has more reason than anyone else there to be stressed.

In light of that, and considering that she was the one that asked me to talk with her in-person, I decided to take a step back. She had a lot on her plate already without me adding to it unprompted, so I thought I'd keep being casual. There wasn't really an opportunity to pull her aside anyways, with all the family conversation, so I thought I'd hold back until she approached me about it.

Turns out, my predictions were off. While everyone else was talking, she slipped out. Then, she did the one thing no one could have ever expected -- fall asleep. It was strategy like we've never seen.

After a confused day had passed without any contact between these two factions, both sides retreated to plan their next move.

**DAY 1, 21:30 HOURS -- ""THE HOUR OF THE OOF""**

These are the times that try men's souls. I had hoped to resolve things quickly, but that hadn't worked. Even worse, my sister seeming unhappy seemed to confirm some of my worst fears. My room at night was silent, save for rain overhead that made a weird twanging sound on my roof, like strings plucked on the banjo of fate. It was truly what the theologians called, ""The Dark 11:30 EST of the Soul."" Also, my computer was broken, so that fucking sucked.

Nevertheless, I resolved to continue. If my grandfather didn't give up when the Japanese bombed the Lusitania, there was no way in hell I'd give up now. The obvious solution? Ask to talk to her alone tomorrow morning. But no one could have expected what happened next. You'd best button up your butthole, *because* *I'm about to scare the shit out of you.*

**DAY 2, 08:00 HOURS -- ""MORNING WOULDN'T""**

After having resolved to ride or die with this whole thing, I woke up the next morning ready to go. But here's what I realized immediately: my sister was gone! She'd driven back to school.

So . . . shit.

Now, someone leaving before you could have an awkward conversation once could be regarded as coincidence. But twice? Worst case scenarios loomed. She'd been the one to initially ask to talk about this in-person, but now I couldn't get ahold of her. If this was a way of avoiding talking to me about this, she must be *dreading* this. And keep in mind that my biggest fear was that they were pitying my misdirected interest enough to make them want to keep the whole thing under wraps rather than talk to me about it.

I learned that she was going to be back at home in the evening. That left several perfectly good hours to panic (strictly internally). Like pretty much everyone in the thread said, however, this whole thing had to be approached calmly. I was in the dark about what my sister thought, but I had to try regardless. As the saying goes, I was like a blind man at an orgy: I'd have to feel things out.

**DAY 2, 21:00 HOURS -- ""THE RHOMBUS OF REGRET""**

The day and hours pass. At last, the moment arises: my sister comes back home. I want to get this thing over with, so I can decide if I need to start some kind of penance process of self-mortification or something. First chance I see, I take the plunge.

So. I ask her if she still wants to talk about this thing. She does, but still seems anxious about it. I sit back and listen, and brace for the worst.

She starts off with an apology for me finding out the way I did, which I told her right away wasn't necessary. She insists anyways, and said that she was planning on formally coming out to me, but was still hesitant about doing it. Now, just to reiterate from the previous thread: I had already known she was gay, on account of her having come out on Instagram. So I assured her right away that I wasn't concerned about that at all, and was already aware -- it was only who her girlfriend was that I hadn't known about.

At this point, all the apologies had come from her side, which I didn't think was at all fair. So I led by apologizing for not picking up on their relationship earlier, and for anything I might have done to make them worried about telling me. Well, she immediately assured me that wasn't the case at all. She apologized again, and said the only reason she hadn't told me earlier was because they didn't want to put me in an awkward position.

Now, them worrying about that was exactly what I was afraid of. I had gone into this whole thing already knowing what that awkward position was: I had accidentally shown interest in her girlfriend, and they didn't know how to tell me. What I was most remorseful about was the thought of having put her or her girlfriend into an uncomfortable place, where they thought they needed to tiptoe around me. I was sorry for that, and told my sister as much.

Imagine my surprise when she seemed confused. And now, *I* was confused. And that's when she explained a little more.

You see, after talking with her this far, she'd told me a little more about what was going on. She and her girlfriend had been dating for 3 months. The only reason my one brother knew is because he had directly asked -- clearly he noticed something I didn't. It's true that *I* didn't know, but neither did my other brother. And, turns out we weren't the only ones.

Now, some of you in the thread before already figured this out. Some others reading this story have probably pieced it together by now. So forgive me for being slow on the uptake -- as this whole saga proves, I'm can be pretty fucking oblivious. But it turns out this whole drama was hinging on a fact I'd completely overlooked.

Remember how I mentioned that the girl at the center of all this was my best friend's sister?

Yup, that's right. My sister's girlfriend hadn't told her brother or anyone in her family about this yet. That awkward situation my sister was worried about? Turns out, *she* was the one worked up about all this the whole time, because she figure'd I wouldn't want to withhold that information from my friend. I had nothing to do with it all along!

Now, I don't want to say I was relieved, because that situation is still pretty shitty for my sister and her girlfriend. And, frankly, it is a little uncomfortable to know about this before my best friend does. But holy shit, I can't even express how glad I am that it wasn't about them catching onto some residual feelings I had. It wasn't really a love triangle the whole time -- more like a non-intersecting quadrilateral where half of the people involved didn't actually have feelings for each other.

Well, first thing I did was promise that I wouldn't say a word about the relationship until they were ready for it. If I'm asked, I'm telling anyone not already in the loop that they should just ask the parties involved. My sister still seemed really broken up about not telling me, so I told her straight up that this was way, way less painful that what I had expected when she said she wanted to talk.

At that point, I just wanted to come clean about the whole thing, so I just told her I'd had a crush on the girl in question and was worried about it. Literal jaw drop. She'd never even known! And neither had her girlfriend, to her knowledge. I must have been less obvious than I thought. Well, after we both laughed and I swore her to secrecy, I told her again that I'd keep my own mouth shut. I also told her that if she and her girlfriend had any problems getting through to her brother, I'd be happy to help try and bring him around -- I don't think that will happen, but it's the least I can do. And I also promised that, no matter what, she can always feel free to bring worries like this to me. Or not. Either way, I'd support her. At last, there was a lot of hugging, and that was that.

Bit of an anticlimax, in retrospect. But I wouldn't want it any other way.

**CONCLUSION -- ""MUTUALLY ASSURED DUMBASS""**

So anyways, that's the end. I was going to compare this situation to my personal Cuban Missile Crisis, but after talking with my sister I realized that the analogy only works if it had turned out the Russians had never actually had any ICBMs and the US almost nuked Orlando by accident.

Even so, I'm a firm believer in learning from experience. So, I'm taking the opportunity to enact new reform measures to prevent reaching DEFCON 1 over this kind of misunderstanding again, these including 1) a red phone line between me and my sister's respective capitals (i.e. telling her that she can feel free to tell me about this sort of thing if she feels the need), 2) a renewed presumption of innocence (i.e. from now on I'm assuming every woman I meet is either dating someone else, gay, or both until I shown evidence to the contrary beyond a reasonable doubt), 3) a modified form of the Mike Pence Gambit (i.e. never ever let myself be in a room alone with my sister's girlfriend under any circumstances), and 4) a major infrastructure spending bill.

**tl:dr --** After a lot of stressing on my part, it turns out the reason they didn't tell me was because the girl is my best friend's sister and they hadn't come out to her family yet. My crush wasn't even noticed! So, we both apologized, laughed, hugged, and everything is good. Huzzah!",relationship_advice
My (42M) daughter (18F) hit my 9 year old son. Kicked her out and my wife thinks I'm overreacting.,"My 18 year old daughter (Chloe) is bipolar and is very difficult to live with. She throws fits over the tiniest of things and blames her depression on everything.  Got a D on a test blames it on depression. Didn't do her chores, blames it on depression. Leaves the house for 4 hours without warning, blames it on depression. Uses my car and leaves it on empty when she gives it to me, blames it on depression. Goes drinking, blames it on depression. 

Chloe has been going to therapy twice a week for the past 4 years and she's still hard to live with. She goes through episodes where she's really pleasant and lovely. We've taken her to a mental health facility 3 times now. Each time she comes home fine for about a month. Then before you know it she turns into Satan. It is impossible to predict. She takes medication for it but she's still all over the place.

We have been trying our best to deal with her but she makes it extremely hard. What set me off the edge was yesterday. 

My 9 year old son told me that Chloe took my grabbed my wallet on the counter and took all the cash I had in it. I confronted Chloe about it. I grounded her for 2 months and took her car keys away. Told her she'll get them back when she is done with the school year (she already was grounded for throwing my son's favorite toy away for no reason). 

I went to grab her keys. Next thing I knew she's gone. I start to look for her. Then I hear crying. Then Chloe yelling ""That's for snitching on me!"" She punched my 9 year old son as hard she possibly could. He was in tears on the floor curling up in a ball. 

I told Chloe that's enough. Told her to pack her things and she's not welcome in our house again. She cried and kept apologizing saying she won't do it again, when I know she will. I told her she has to leave immediately. 

She grabbed her things and I tossed her the keys to her car and said ""I'll deposit $250 in you account. That'll be enough for a hotel for a little bit. Figure out where you'll be staying."" She left within 10 minutes. 

I go to check on my son and he has a massive red mark on his stomach. I took him to the hospital and the doctor said he will be fine after time (btw that was fun having to explain to the police). I check on it the next day and it is MASSIVE. 

While all this was happening my wife was on a business trip and I explained everything to her. She thinks that we should have dealt with her in another way. I disagree saying that we should have done this a long time ago.

We both wanted to post this on here and ask what could have I done differently to fix this. 

TLDR: 18 year old daughter punched my 9 year old son as hard as she could. Made her leave and find her own living arrangements.


Update: I woke up to some pretty good advice this morning. What I think I'm going to do is to get her an apartment. I can pay for it. I'll pay for everything but the groceries and all the furniture are on her. I'm gonna keep doing this until she either agrees to mental institution (took her once without consent. Never got better there. Just pretended she did) or she goes to college. She's not that bad of a student. She's about to  start her senior year.",relationship_advice
My (20F) very private best friend (19F) is finally bringing her bf (20M) to meet our group. We have another friend (19M) who is crushing on her HARD and is planning to crash the event to have a talk with my friend's bf. WTF DO WE DO,"Hi everyone. Throwaway acc. This is going to be long. My best friend, S, has been dating the same guy, C, on and off for about 3 years. We've never met him because he lives so far from the rest of the group. Recently, she bonded with our friend J after hanging out with him and seeing a movie. They've been hanging out, hiking, doing outdoorsy stuff that the rest of the gang isn't really into. J has developed a GIGANTIC crush on S. S has noticed and does not encourage him in any way, but is super non confrontational and refuses to bring it up to him so he doesn't get embarrassed. She doesn't want to ruin the friendship, and since she found out, she hadn't hung out with him one on one and has cut down a bit on their communication. We all pretty much know that once we go back to college for the semester, it will die down. However, things kind of suck for the time being. 

J is clingy and hangs onto S when we hang out in a group. He is constantly trying to pull her attention away from us like a child. He will poke her arm, say her name in her ear when she is talking or being spoken to, and even physically pick her up and take her away (she is 5'2 and slender, he is 6'4 and very strong). At first, she took it light heartedly, but now she is avoiding being touched by him at all. She is very anxious and non confrontational, and I usually have to tell him to cut it out because she's afraid to say something. I don't mind, obviously at some point she has to learn to stand up for herself, but she and I have already spoken about that and she's taking the proper steps. But also, like I said, she is doing absolutely nothing to encourage him in any way. I just want to drive the point home that this really is NOT her fault, and J's actions are distressing her greatly. 

S and J had a falling out 2 days ago where he completely blew up at her. J constantly brings C into the conversation and S tries to avoid it, but J is obsessed with C. If we're hanging out and he hears her say his name, he will come running from wherever he is to listen and even tries to grab her phone to read their messages if she's texting him. I've linked the screenshots of their fight that S sent me, with some stuff blurred out for anonymity. Blue is S, gray is J. I am E, for reference, and our other friend is L. [texts.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4sXnDDC) 

So S kind of went off on him and blocked him after uninviting him, but it's been a long time coming. Almost every one on one convo they have is J trying to get S to talk about what's wrong in her relationship. He even does this in front of the rest of the friend group. S has told me that when they're alone, he asks very very specific questions about their issues and even about her sex life, kinks and all that Jazz. At first, she said she thought it was light hearted, but now it's creepy. And it is true that he tries to compete with me for the ""best friend"" role (S and I have been best friends for like 10 years. They just became close a couple months ago). 

So yes, C is coming to stay with S at her place for the next two weeks. He moved away 2 years ago, so they are long distance over the summers. S has invited us to her place Friday night, and through our friend L I heard that J is still very much planning on going. L came over to my place last night, as she was very concerned. She told me that J was going to crash the party (should also add that this is going to be my fucking BIRTHDAY PARTY) to have a ""man to man"" talk with C about S. Knowing what I know about C, he wouldn't entertain J at all. Knowing what I know about J, L and I are worried he might try to get physical with C. What do we say to J to stop him from coming to the party?? What do we do??? This is so much drama that our group never has and I feel so bad for S. My dear friend doesn't deserve this. How do L and I deal with J without hurting S or C in the process?? Thanks to those who read through the whole thing!! 

Tl;dr: our friend has a massive crush on my bff. He was rude to her the other night and she uninvited him from my birthday celebration where the group would be meeting her boyfriend of 3 years for the first time. Our friend is planning on crashing the even to have a ""man to man"" talk with the bf. How do we handle this?

Edit: we all call each other ""bb"" in the friend group. S did not mean it in a flirty way at all. It's an inside joke!",relationship_advice
"My husband was having an affair for two years, got her pregnant twice, all while I was pregnant","I found out on Sunday that my husband has been having an affair for two years. I know her. We had been married for a little over a year when he started so the majority of our marriage has been voided for me. I had blamed myself for lack of connection but never knew why. He has said that he was doing it some of the time because she was threatening to tell me and his family. She is the one that told me about it through a letter. He has confirmed that she had two abortions with his children. He was having the affair 9 months prior to my pregnancy, the entirety of my pregnancy (with her becoming pregnant weeks of my due date), and saw her soon after she was born (a couple of weeks). It continued until last Tuesday. I have been struggling deeply with this betrayal. 
He has allowed me to look through his things but with Snapchat being their main form of communication, there is not much for me to see....until I looked at his email. I found multiple sex pictures of them...in July (my daughter was a month old). This has sent me to the deepest end. I can't stop thinking about them. I can't stop sending them to him to remind him of his reality. I saw in the picture, they were in a hotel and I asked. They meet in a hotel right next to my house at least 5times. The other times, he would drop my daughter off at day care and go straight to her house.  
I don't know how to move forward. 
UPDATE: the hardest thing is that he is seemingly extremely remorseful... ",relationship_advice
"My 29 F fiance 29 M has ghosted me since he found out about my past (long, sorry) (update) (very long, I put a tl;dr at bottom)","Several people asked me to update this and I'm sorry that I just am now getting to it.  Here is a link to my first post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9q2mwp/my_29_f_fiance_29_m_has_ghosted_me_since_he_found/

The title of the post was really inaccurate on my part because he did get in touch with me and we met for several hours on Sunday.  So he didn't ghost me, he never intended to ghost me and his family did not lie for him.  In fact before we had time to talk at church his brother came to me and apologized for the way he handled my phone call.  He said he clearly did not understand his brother's wish to be alone to think and on his own interpreted that to mean he didn't want to talk to me.  The rest of his family had no idea there was any significant problem and did not know where he was because he went away for the week told them to only contact him for any emergency's.  Obviously they knew something was up but had no idea.  

So the ghosting part was a combination of miscommunication and well honestly just anxiety and impatience on my part.  We both apologized over that and moved on.

Anyway we met at church for morning service and I got there first and went and set in our usual spot and he got there just as the service was starting but he came over and sat down beside me and we shared a quick smile as the service started (I was dying inside).

After service was over people were shaking hands talking, this is when his brother came to me to apologize and while we were talking he slipped away and talked to a few other people (I have a feeling this was planned but whatever).

He came back over and asked how I was and I almost lost it but I held it together and said I was okay, but obviously I was tearing up as we were talking.  He asked if I wanted to talk now or later and I just wanted to get it over with because if he was going to break up with me I just wanted it to be done and over with so I could go home and start the grieving.  So I just said I'm ready.  He said he really wanted to talk somewhere private and asked where I would prefer to go and all I could think of was my place so I didn't have to drive when it was all over with. 

He followed me home and he came inside and said that he really wanted this to be civil (not a good sign).  By this time I was already a bundle of nerves so I just blurted out ""are you going to leave me"" obviously I'm crying as I say this.  What he said next left me with a lot of hope because I really thought this was a done deal.  He said that a lot of what happens going forward would depend on what I said that day with him and how much I wanted to tolerate from him.  That last part really confused me but I just was so relieved that he didn't say yes that I basically collapsed into my chair and told him that I was ready to do whatever it took.

He then said that if that was the case then he would ask for two things from me and that was honesty and patience.  

He started off apologizing to me for not being a better man.  Well that was all I could take, when he said that the flood gates came open.  Here was this wonderful man who I basically lied to and dropped probably what I can only imagine from a mans point of view being one of the worst things you could ever tell a future spouse and he was apologizing to me.  I had to hug him and tell him not to apologize to me.  He held me as I cried for a few minutes, but then tried to gather myself to listen to him.

He went on to say that he had a horrible week.  He said he had to come face to face with a lot of his own insecurities, jealousy's and prejudices.  He also said that he learned something about himself and he did not like what he learned.  He said up until I told him my story that he did not realize that he was very possessive and had a jealous streak.  He talked a lot about it but I'll skip that because it was really personal and well this is already going to be the length of a book.

He then asked me if I was willing to put up with him having some very probing question and some very personal comments about them.  Again I said I was going to do whatever it took.

So he asked the following questions.

1.  Did I use protection every time?
2.  Did I have any interaction with anyone sexually in the city we live in now?
3.  Did I have any idea how many people I had sex with?
4.  Have I been tested for any sexually transmitted diseases and if so when was the last time and did I keep records of it?
5.  Am I willing to be tested again and even again in the future.
6.  Did I ever have sex with anyone without them being a customer?
7.  What types of drugs did I take?
8.  When was the last time I took drugs?
9.  Do I feel any need or desire to take drugs or any other substance since this incident occurred?
10. How can I guarantee to him that I won't in the future turn back to drugs?
11.  Does sex have any real meaning for me and do I enjoy it or is it just something I do now to be close to him?
12.  How much money did I steal?
13.  Did I pay back the money?
14.  Have I ever stolen any money or anything else without it being for drugs?
15.  How can I guarantee him that I won't steal from him in the future?

This took several hours to answer because I had to often stop to compose myself but I answered everyone of his questions as honestly as I could.  He often told me that I didn't have to answer them if I didn't want to and kept apologizing for asking but he said that to go forward with anything he knew that he had to know or he just wouldn't be able to.

He then listed out his concerns and asked if I really wanted to work with him on them and he would understand if I didn't want to.  I said I wouldn't be here if I didn't want this.

So his concerns were as follows.

A.  He is afraid that if times get rough in the future for whatever reason I might steal from him or his family.  Honestly I was surprised by this as this was not something I thought would be an issue but it was the first thing he talked about.  Now to be fair his family owns a business, they are not rich but they are not poor either so I guess he's worried when he takes over I might steal.

B.  In his words he has an irrational fear that once a junkie always a junkie and he said he doesn't know how strong he is and it would kill him if we stayed together and I sunk back into that world.

C.  His fear that sex would be an issue going forward.  He said that he has had horrible intrusive thoughts all week.  The fact that I have been with so many people and done so many different things that nothing would ever be special and ultimately he was afraid he would become bitter because he would feel like we were just having sex for him and that knowing that I would just be participating would really make his desire to have sex with me drop significantly.

Again I listened to him and answered every concern, to what I could.  He said he knew a lot of this was nothing I could ever really guarantee but he just had to talk about it.  I told him that I understood and I had already suspected some of this would come up.

As I said we spent several hours going over this stuff.  We had to take a couple of breaks so that way our emotions would not get the better of us.  He really went through the range of emotions himself but I knew I had to let him if I wanted this to work.  

He told me he was willing to stay and try to make this work because he really loved me.  Obviously my heart leaped at this and I cried again (you would think with everything I have been through I would be tougher than this).  But he said that he did not feel like we could go through with the wedding as scheduled and that in all honesty he would like to end our engagement and stay dating (exclusive of course) for awhile.  He said in all honesty he felt like while he believes me and feels like he knows me he wants to take the time to look at this from a new perspective (this is where the part about feeling like he didn't really know me come in).  

I took off my ring to give it to him and for the first time he broke down and cried.  He told me to put it back on and that he just wants so postpone the wedding, not end the engagement.  I told him we could do whatever he thought we had to do.  He said we are just going to tell people we are going to postpone the date due to scheduling conflicts and we would let them know a new date.

Then we had to decide what we were going to be telling family.  He said from his side of the family that he is going to tell them that he was feeling pressured at work and that he got upset over a misunderstanding about time away.  I told him that I would say whatever he wanted.  He said it was best to not tell anyone else about my past except for our minister who we are going to start going to couples counseling with.  We both agreed to this.

As to my family, well this is where the one problem we had that day came up.  He just assumed my family knew.  I told him they only know about the drugs and stealing.  He said that he thought my parents should know because they are paying for the wedding and it will cause some problems cancelling events and stuff and he did not want them to think this was just because I used drugs years ago.  It wasn't a deal breaker for him he said but it was something he felt was right but would abide by whatever I thought was best.  

I really do not want to tell my parents.  What I did was bad enough (stealing and doing drugs) but if they knew I stripped and prostituted myself I don't think I could ever look them in the eye again and they have been so wonderful to me since I've come back.

So in conclusion this ended better than I ever dreamed possible.  Yes I know he has a diminished view of me, he really was upset that I waited so long to tell him, but I had to know that this was inevitable and he said once he gets over the initial shock he will try his best to never bring it up again.  He truly is a wonderful man and I am so very lucky that God put him in my life.  

tl;dr:  He asked a lot of questions, he stated a lot of concerns but in the end he is going to stick it out and try and make it work.  I am so very happy

**EDIT** Wow there are lot of serious misconceptions being sent to me via DM about my life.  Let me make this clear, I did NOT grow up in an abusive household.  I was NEVER sexually molested/raped as a child or teenager.  I had a loving family who I by my own actions broke their hearts.  I am blessed beyond words that they have accepted me back and have been nothing but loving and supportive.  Both of my parents are my hero's.  My Mom was just trying to protect me, she wasn't trying to be my accomplice.  

Secondly to answer this here.  If I wanted to stay with him I had to let him ask me those questions.  He gave me every opportunity to shut it down and even several times while we were talking he asked if I wanted him to stop.  He was hurting, by his own words from his own insecurities.  Answering the questions, even as uncomfortable as they were, bonded us in my opinion because he actually engaged in conversation with me and listened to everything I said.  Besides some of my answers are not nearly as dramatic as some of you have believed.  ",relationship_advice
[UPDATE] My parents [50s] cancelled a trip out to visit me [27F] to dog sit my sister's [32F] dog,"[Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b4carp/my_parents_50s_cancelled_a_trip_out_to_visit_me/)

**Summary of original post:** Parents were planning on flying out to me, their sick/disabled daughter, but cancelled last minute to babysit the dog of their other daughter who was going on a ""surprise"" vacation to Europe. 


Went on social media for the first time in a while. Turns out my sister didn't even leave for Europe until yesterday. Saw her posts about landing in Europe. So she left on Friday. My parents were supposed to *get back* to where they live on Thursday. There was no overlap.

Now I feel hurt again. I feel like I should just be *done* with these people, but that seems immature. ",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in front of everyone?","First of all,  thank you to everyone who offered advice it means a great deal to me. I thought I would post a follow up considering the amount of traction this post received. 

So as some of you suggested, I reached out to my brother and expressed my frustration and sadness given the whole situation. I was not able to reach him through phone, so I ended up sending him a text detailing all this information. I didn't hear anything from him the rest of day so I started to wonder if he was just going to ignore my message. Then today I got a text from his fiancé  saying, ""Good morning [my name]. I didn't mean any offense when I said that comment the other night. I was trying to make light of the situation and kind of pump you up make you feel good? Like kind of a ""yay"" thing. I should have taken into consideration that we were in front of everyone & I don't know 100% what's going on. I know you were considerate about the pearl thing so I should do the same. I do apologize and didn't mean any harm, it won't happen again♥️"". 

I have mixed feelings about her response. While I do appreciate her reaching out and apologizing, I am struggling to believe she genuinely thought this would make me feel good, or in her words ""pump me up"". Right...because nothing pumps you up like having your relationship issues put on blast and shared to the masses? I received this message two hours ago and I have yet to reply. Like many of you suggested this seemed more a tactic for her to persuade how people see me. I do know for certain she is a very judgmental person (which gives me more reason to doubt the authenticity of her reply) . For example, I've witnessed on several occasions her be rude to waitstaff, talk down on other people's relationships, lives, and jobs. 

After further reading comments I have started to speculate she decided to publicly ""joke"" about my relationship issues in a desperate attempt to boost her own insecurities. For starters she does not allow my brother to go out to bars with his male friends because in her words ""those are not activities taken men do"". He's not allowed to drive his Camaro to the gym as she believes this will attract others girl attention. Also, as I'm sure you can conclude from all this he is by no means allowed to have any female friends. I could go on and on here, but you get the idea. Because of this I do wonder if she is trying to embarrass me publicly in an attempt to boost her self esteem. At a minimum I do believe it makes her a hypocrite. 

I am also little disappointed I haven't received a response from my brother. While he obviously relayed the message to her, it would have been nice to hear from him as well. As others pointed out it may not be in my best interest to confide in him going forward. As for my reply to his fiancé , I still am unsure what is the best course of action to take. Perhaps just let it go, and only press the issue if it happens again? I have a feeling this won't be the last time despite what she's said here. I will update you all here once I gather my thoughts and decide what I should say going forward. 

Edit for clarification: she noted how I was considerate given the ""Pearl"" situation. This is my lifelong friend of over 10 years. My brother and my friend pearl had a  brief fling that lasted a few months back in 2012. My brother came to me explaining how his fiancé was very upset that I would share funny stories about me and Pearl's  travels together in front of her. I apologized and explained to my brother I had no idea she even knew about their brief fling (given it was so long ago). I was a little surprised he even thought to mention it to her when he explained she somehow managed to find text messages between them on his phone dating all the way back to 2012. From that point on I was not allowed to even mention her name around my brothers fiancé, let alone invite her on any family outings (as I used to do frequently). She has even ""overheard"" our private conversations between me and brother where I've mentioned Pearl's name, to which she criticized my brother for not completely shutting down the conversation immediately. She's a real gem, I know.
