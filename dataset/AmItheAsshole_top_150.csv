"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: wow, this got very big. it's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

and alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so i might have a warped view on this one. 

edit 3: i've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent tl,dr: ""you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole""",3
"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"update: for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. everyone's comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

since i received such great advice on my original post, i felt like i had an obligation to update. and i'm trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

we went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

i'm doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

i haven't reached out to any of marcy's family and i don't plan to. i understand now how devastating that would be. 

that's it. take care everyone.",3
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"for making a dad joke?. note. my step-daughter, madeline, was about a year old when i married her mother, jessica. madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. she did something bad, so while picking her up, i set a punishment up for her. then she said ""you're not my dad. i don't have to follow you"". honestly, i got a bit hurt from that. but i understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. i just replied ""i'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
that happened about 2 days ago. so our family was going grocery shopping, when madeline said ""i'm hungry. i need food."" i decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""hi hungry, i'm not your dad."" my son just started to laugh uncontrollably. my daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. and my wife was berating me ""not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
i honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. and my son agrees. so aita?
 
edit: i did adopt her. so legally i am her parent.

 
mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

family is blaming me for their marital problems. i refuse to accept i did anything wrong. my sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all i did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",3
"for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger ""tig bitties""?. pretty much the title. my son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him ""tig"". he asked me what its last name should be. i couldn't help myself and just instantly replied ""bitties"". then i turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked ""bitties"", so now his tiger is tig bitties. my wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, i think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.",3
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


anyway. aita?",3
"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback).

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?. **updated 7:50 pm:** holy crap! thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. i never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! i had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when i checked back in after work. several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200b;

my intent was to answer more questions since i wasn't able to do that while at work. i was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however i've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what i have already posted if i wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200b;

just a couple things i want to address in my update here. some people are saying i'm leaving out details. my original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. i had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so i apologize if it looks like details have been left out. i did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. lastly, my son is now back with me. there was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200b;

i'm sorry if i didn't respond to your comment or private message. i'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. i can't even begin to put into words how grateful i am. again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him. 

he told my family and they think i'm the asshole. aita?",3
"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: she 100% knows that i am his girlfriend, i have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",3
"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


edit:  i see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  i suggest you read the full rule book and the faq if you think you've got a new idea.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. 

i just want to know what reddit thinks because half my friends think i should go and the other half think i'm justified in saying no.",3

"for calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after i asked her multiple times not to.. i have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. i'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. she is very overweight. all the time she makes comments about my weight. she doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and i even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". i have only worked there 8 days. i have asked her very nicely to stop. yesterday i asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3
"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3
"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3
"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3
"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

i noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so i kinda wondered if i stepped too much out of line there.",3
"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

she said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones.

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

a lot of you post about stuff because your friends and family aren't on reddit, but now we need to be careful as to what other social media they may be on, and take extra steps to preserve your anonymity. throwaways are already encouraged, but make sure names are changed enough (not just initials), and change any non-relevant details. good luck!

"for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

i was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean. 

last week i got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on facebook that marcy had od'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming thursday.

i immediately just burst into tears because i hoped that this would never happen and i feel so much guilt over it. 

i want to go to the funeral service for her but i'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. at the most i would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. i need to do this for myself. 

for wanting to go?",3
"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3
"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3
"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3
"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3
"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you. 

i will accept any judgment",3
"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

thank you all for your comments and i wish everyone the best.",3
"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3
"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3
"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

for what i did?",3
"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

obviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides bursts of anger and then ghosting.",3
"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

second edit: wow this is on the front page, i never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! i'm sorry i can't reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",3
"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

so pardon my french, but what the fuck?",3
"for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?. on my gf's birthday i gave her a necklace that i spent $400 on.  i wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but i was expecting something.

here's how it went down.  after dinner she asked me if i was ready for my gift, i said yes and she started giving me oral.  she doesn't like giving oral and i'm ok with it.  she was giving bad oral and honestly i just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.

i feel disappointed.   i don't think sex is a gift.  i didn't expect a gift that was equal to what i spent, but i wanted a least something.",3
"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3
"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3
"for turning the home i inherited into an airbnb? my sister thought it would be a ""family home"" forever..  i will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. about six months or so ago my grandpa died. for simplicity sake, let's say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. in his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  his estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in california. basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. m

i got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. for the last six months i've allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but i just got my first tax bill and i either have to sell it or start making some income off it. after talking to the real estate agent i've decided the best course of action is to put it on airbnb. that way i can still use it if i like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there's not someone renting full-time.

 my sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all i know she's upset because she can no longer use the house for free. but she's also telling me that i basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. she has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. she also says it's not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but i still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house i could stay there any time i want.  she's my older sister and i've always been impressionable to the things she says to me and i'm feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. am i the asshole here?",3
"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3
"for being upset because my son didn't talk to me, but talked to my wife.. i'm 40m, my wife is 39f, son in 15. 

yesterday when it was dinner time i called him to come downstairs few times. he didn't answer me so i assumed that he didn't hear me. i went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he'd come downstairs in few minutes. after 15 minutes he still didn't come downstairs so i walked in his room. i knocked first. he was obviously crying. i asked him what was wrong but he didn't answer me so i didn't push him more. 

 i went downstairs and told my wife about it. she went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. she came back and brought him food upstairs. when i asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn't anything important and told me to drop it. i got kind of upset because i want to know what was wrong and i'm his parent as well. 

i haven't been fully ignoring them but i've been acting kinda distant since yesterday. my wife got mad at said that i was acting extremely immature.",3
"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3
"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. 

amy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.",3
"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""they started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. 

this sub isn't ""was this person in the wrong to do this to me"" its ""am i the asshole.""  esh exists. nah exists. ""nta, but you should still apologize/try better next time"" exists. let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.",3
"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3
"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3
"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

tl;dr i thought i had it all but now i just have a lot of eggs.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

i hung up on her. when recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that i was the asshole here for dropping it like that. but i don't think she was ever going to drop it if i didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. so aita?",3
"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? if i was willing to fly with one seat i wouldn't have bought a second seat.

note - i do not take two seats on the train/bus ever. they are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so i don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",3
"for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?. so my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. we get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, i'm hungry. 

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3
"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update to for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?.  

my original posting: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_disabled\_son\_and\_his\_partner(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita_for_telling_my_disabled_son_and_his_partner)

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

thank you to everyone for telling me i wasn't completely crazy.",3
"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3
"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.. throwaway, and i will be keeping this is anonymous as i can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with jon's permission i posted all the screenshots on my facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me i have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, i've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that i'm now ruining my sisters life.

i've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.",3
"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. 

and to the people who said she'll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",3
"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3
"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3
"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless. 

asked why they broke up.

the guy was cheating on his wife. he confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. has three kids. all her age or older. she dumped him.",3
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3
"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

"for filling a few faux amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?. this has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. there are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... i have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. the first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a bluetooth speaker.  amazon replaced all my packages and i would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so i decided to fill a few packages with chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. i also taped notes that said "" dear children, stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. or am i a diabolical genius?",3
"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3
"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

thanks again.",3
"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3
"for laughing my ass off at my wife's expense?. just for context, i am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. she is insecure about her height and while i try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she doesn't like about herself.

with this in mind, we recently went to one of my favorite places to eat. now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. 
we ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

i honestly couldn't help but burst out laughing to the point that i had tears in my eyes and i had to compose myself before driving back home.

"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3
"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3
"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3
"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

"aita: for not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?. i (f20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

the last time i lived here was 2-3 years ago. back then i remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3
"for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?. my former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. as a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so i was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. she (now laura) has not started hrt yet but is living fulltime as a woman. laura and i no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3
"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3
"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i told cliff what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said ""don't concern yourself with what they say. they're childish"". so i dunno...aita?",3
"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3
"update: for not adhering to the wedding dress code. so i posted about a month ago about my sister requesting i wear a long sleeve ankle length black dress to her lakeside wedding in summer, while being 9 months pregnant and i've gotten many requests to update

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3
"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for telling my wife that if she quits her job i expect her to cover all the housework?. my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.. so right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because i won't give up my appointed time with them. my son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200b;

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

i'm so pissed right now. am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during my time with my kids? how is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",3
"for flipping at my husband for spending thousands of dollars on a football game with his buddies, without telling me about it?. for starters, i'm a 26 year old woman, my husband is 25. we also have a 2 year old son. we both work full time and make good money, he brings in more than i do, but i think that's besides the point. we also have a joint account. so fast forward to the game, apparently he decided to take it upon himself to take him and 3 buddies to a game with a party bus, great seats, etc and all the other shenanigans with a sports event. he makes a lot more than his buddies and he wanted to ""have a good time with them"". when i checked the account, he spent over 4 thousand dollars! my jaw dropped when i saw it. i confronted him about it the day after and he told me that ""he's able to because he makes good money and it's not gonna break our bank"", he then went on to say to me that i don't get to choose what he spends his money on. i was super pissed and was like ""it's our money"" and we've got bills and a child to care for and support. he continued to tell me that i was the one in the wrong and that he's a responsible adult who doesn't need to have his purchases ""monitored by his wife"". so my question is aita?

edit: i appreciate the support, this really has hit me pretty hard, i feel like i've been betrayed. i'm new to reddit btw. it's making me feel like i'm not of equal importance in this family. i've been with my husband for 6 years and i've never felt this way before.

edit #2 our combined yearly income is 260k, my husband makes 200k, i make 60k per year.

edit#3 to all the people sending me hate mail calling me a stupid whore, cunt, i hope you feel good about yourself for insulting somebody you don't know. i'm glad that on a platform to express concern, i get bombarded with hate.",3
