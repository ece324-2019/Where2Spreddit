"warning: at&t applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent. so over the holiday i received an email with an order confirmation from at&t (my isp, and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).

i haven't ordered anything so the first thing i thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. i immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. i had a notification that showed that at&t had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""(https://imgur.com/lruuetx)

obviously i was annoyed by this, so i dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. i then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called ""customer loyalty speed upgrade""(https://imgur.com/ptyazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

i then looked at my bill and found that they had upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent(https://imgur.com/thjwb7j), under the guise of ""customer loyalty"", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most isps occasionally do. 

i immediately called and spoke to a rep named jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that at&t was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. i don't for one second believe this was accidental. i believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

make sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. i'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and i don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but i do feel like at&t should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so i wanted to post to show everyone what happened. if this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. this was just the closest thing i could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. i usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so i could make the post easier w/ images etc. not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as i'm pretty sure i didn't even have at&t then lol ... anyway, here's the email i received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing(https://i.imgur.com/i7w1vpu.png)

**edit 2:** since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what i did: you should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that i got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. as others have noted in the comments always watch your bill closely!

**edit 3:** fixed some formatting stuff

**edit 4:** holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! thanks anonymous reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!

**one last edit:** from a pm i received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but i thought this was great info: 

>i work in big telcom. what you experienced is called a ""slam sale"" in the industry. it's when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. the salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. 

>oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. it was popular until 10 years ago, and it's almost unheard of today. i wasn't aware that at&t was experiencing slam sales today. 

>you can protect your account from slam sales. all the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. call at&t, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. you can setup either a password or a pin that must be entered to make any account changes. 

>sorry this happened to you.

and another pm:

>i also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account pin/password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. pretty much every isp and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified as400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay. scroll about halfway down in this(http://www.makotek.net/intranet/forms/icoms%20technician%20guide.pdf) pdf for some screenshots.

all of these companies are regulated — a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you're not ripped off. these companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won't do anything about it. when you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them, they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain, they'll fix the whole system, which helps other people.

the types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you), service (you're not getting what you're paying for), unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. all of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it's awesome. it's sort of crazy more people don't know about them.

"u.s. breaks up fake i.r.s. phone scam operation -- 21 people sentenced for up to 20 yrs, 32 in india indicted. some good news(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: 

>with stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the united states and a round of indictments in india, the justice department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation's first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.

>over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the united states lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said friday. the money was routed through call centers in india back to the ringleaders in eight states.

>the fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. a person posing as an internal revenue service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

>in an announcement on friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states — illinois, arizona, florida, california, alabama, new jersey and texas — were sentenced last week in houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

>in addition, 32 contractors in india involving five call centers in ahmedabad, a city in western india, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

as always, remain vigilant about supposed irs claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the irs. the irs never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. communication always begins over snail mail. hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations.

"i made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!. hey guys! last year i made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- i'm terrible at sticking to a budget so i made a sheet that breaks it down so that i just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

heres what it looks like(https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

i grew up very poor and had no sense of what or even how to start budgeting. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number.

&#x200b;

the sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200b;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200b;

so how does it work?

the main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200b;

* income: you use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. if you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- so for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* expenses:  there you can add your expenses. utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. within your expenses there are two areas to which you need to pay attention:-credit card payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. decide whether to pay the minimum payment or choose an amount to pay. the tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-big purchase: use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* budget summary:  finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- here you will see just how much you can spend. this money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. as long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. it will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income vs spending is!

&#x200b;

~~here is a link to the sheet~~(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ycjtrgvkum7sixilsaqnlhxwemh-qgbeulzbm5bedmg/copy)

&#x200b;

ou use it like this

* go in
* make a copy
* change the numbers
* decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* budget.

the sheet includes three charts:

* a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* a pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

"stop spending money on food! -- buy a crockpot. **holy shit at the money people spend on food!**

and i was the exact same way when i landed my first job out of college.  you know what i'm talking about--biscuit and starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  every night!  all week!  professional money spender!  and more beers and dinners on the weekends!  woohoo!

wait.  where did all my money go?  and how the hell did i gain 40 pounds in six months?  if you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-i-can trap.  and you have to stop it.  it's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (literally--i was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)

**what you know you need to do: *stop eating out***

but how??? how do i stop eating out???  fast food is *soooo* good!  and cooking is *soooo* hard!  well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  you're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....

>crockpot.  it's the crockpot.  crockpot.  crockpot.  maybe you call it a slow cooker, but i'm from georgia and here it's a crockpot.  

***!stop!***--if you do not own a crockpot i highly recommend you go buy one from amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!

get one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *just google it cause mods dont like links!*

**boom!**  $39 investment.  we're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  are you ready?  we're going to make enough food for dinner *and* left overs for lunch.

i'm going to give you some of my super-secret-i-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  yes.  the crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**meal 1: thick cut porkchop with potatoes and carrots**

>servings: 4

>ingredients:

>1 can beef broth (50 cents)

>spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  place porkchops in broth.  chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  that's it.

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home make your salad and dig in.  use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 2: sausage, potato and kale soup**
>servings: 4

>total cost: about $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  while meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (i get two recipes per bag of kale).

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 3: super awesome easy chili**
>servings: a lot (6-8?) -- i eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>edit: the spice proportions are correct!  this makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7l).

>edit: salt to taste($1)

>total cost = $20/8 = about $2.50 per serving

>drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  brown the ground beef.  add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


it's easy guys.  it's really easy.  you spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a lot of money!  and its good for you! (better than wendy's--that's for sure!)  and its easy!

**stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  i am much happier and much wealthier!**

edit: for our vegetarian friends.  you can't get any more simple than this!

**meal 4: baked potato**
>servings: as many potatoes as you bake

>1 potato

>cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**meal 5: vegetable soup**
>servings: however much you want to make

>tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, zucchini, carrots, peas, or onions

>vegetable stock

>onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper

>add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  season to taste.  cook on low until vegetables are tender.

edit 2: i live in georgia and shop at kroger--prices may vary.  if you live in canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

edit 3: ""just learn to cook!""--yeah, okay guys.  i agree.  i cook more than just in a crockpot.  this post was inspired after i read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  i wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  the point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

edit 4: i agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  this post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.

edit 5: electricity costs: crockpots seem to consume between 200w and 700w per hour.  that's between 2 and 6 kwhs for 8 hours of cooking.  that's about 15 to 60 cents.  it seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

edit 6: i'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  i'm a mechanical engineer.  don't believe me?  my first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

take off your tin foil hat..... and use it to wrap a baked potato to put in your *new crockpot!!!*",11
"quick reminder to not give away your salary requirement in a job interview. i know i've read this here before but had a real-life experience with it yesterday that i thought i'd share. 

going into the interview i was hoping/expecting that the range for the salary would be similar to where i am now. when the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, i responded by asking, ""what is the range for the position?"" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than i was expecting/am making now. essentially, if i would have given the range i was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than i am making it now) i still would have sold myself short.

"irs will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27

the irs is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. this will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).

edit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.

according to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. i think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt ""behind"".

thoughts? this is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.

edit 2: due to the popularity of this post, i wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.

>we don't allow:
 • moralizing issues
 • petitions
 • political discussions
 • political baiting
 • soapboxing

this is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. please keep things on topic.


edit 3: since a lot of people are confused, i'll explain how a 401k match works. a 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. the 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. this is usually done via a matching mechanism: i contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. matches are almost always capped.

with the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. so say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). you aren't contributing to your 401k currently. if your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.

this doesn't ""hurt"" people without loans. this is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. participation isn't compulsory.",11

companies need to get back to rewarding employees for their tenure. until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. when you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. the more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.

"i mde a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget! ver. 2.0. hey guys! i'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet i made. earlier this year i posted the spreadsheet i made for myself and it really resonated with people. as i got more and more feedback i found places where i could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. 

you can find pictures of it here(https://imgur.com/a/63lxvuq)

a bit of background on me and why i made this- and also why it's made the way it is. i grew up poor and was never taught about how to handle money. if we had money it was already needed for other things. food, bills, all of the money we had already had a place. this made me get a mentality that if i had money i needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. it's unhealthy, but it was the only thing i knew until i moved out. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. 

&#x200b;

another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number. 

&#x200b;

i have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:

* that it be easy to use
* that i can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals
* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget

the sheet is divided into a few different tools.

budget:

* select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.
* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses
* the expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. you can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. 

your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. yes i know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.

&#x200b;

this sheet focuses on giving you one number to remember. daily spendable. if you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you dont go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. 

 i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

there are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. it includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown.

"last month, i spent $770 eating out. this month, i've spent $42. this is only the first of many financial self control habits i'm trying to get myself into!. in my credit card's april-may billing cycle, i spent **$770** eating out as *one person.* i decided to track my spending in this area by putting all my meals i've been eating out on a credit card used only for that purpose. i looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money i was spending eating out. i thought it might be $300ish dollars! 

anyway, i paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow i would eat at home at every possible meal i could for the foreseeable future. i've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, i went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was i making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. and the kicker is i still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week. the only two meals i bought this month were a bk chicken sandwich while i was on the road and a birthday meal for someone. 

it feels awesome to have a 70% reduction in spending in this area just due to self control. 

i'm planning on using this self control in other areas. next one is booze and cigarettes. then my shitty habit of mobile game micro transactions. 

sometimes i don't know how i've made it this far without being broke.",11
"be careful what you say in public. my wife and i were at panera eating breakfast and we noticed a lady be hind us talking on the phone very loudly. we couldn't help over hearing  her talk about a bill not being paid. we were a little annoyed but not a big deal because it was a public restaurant. we were not trying to listen but were shocked when she announced that she was about to read her card number. she then gave the card's expiration date, security code, and her zip code. we clearly heard and if we were planning on stealing it she gave us plenty of notice to get a pen.

don't read your personal information in public like this. you never know who is listening and who is writing stuff down.",11
"when heading into black friday sales, it's not a sale if you didn't plan to buy the item in the first place.. many people i see go into a store to buy one or two things, and come out with way more than they anticipated, with the excuse ""oh i saved money! it was all on sale!"". 

if you we're going to get the item anyway, yes you saved money, but if you didn't plan on it, you still spent money you didn't have to.

edit: you could also set a budget, $150 for example. if you're going into a store, don't bring your card, only bring cash so you're not tempted to go over your limit. (edit of an edit: someone mentioned you could miss out on some rewards or promotions if you don't have your card, so i wonder what another way to limit yourself other than willpower would be?)

edit 2: thank you all so much for the support on this post, i tried replying to the comments at the start but it became overwhelming with the amount of comments coming in, thank you all for your input and advice to others!

"transunion burying their credit freeze to sell their own credit monitoring product trueidentity. i'm not sure where to post this, but noticed something had changed on the transunion website about freezing credit this morning when i was giving links to family so they could freeze theirs. 

i froze my credit the day after news about the equifax breach broke, and it looks like transunion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called trueidentity (like what equifax was doing with their trustedid premier.)


the ftc website links to this page(http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with transunion.


this is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.(https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) the instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own trueidentity product.


if you want to place a credit freeze with transunion now:

* you have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to ""lock your credit information by enrolling in trueidentity.""
* the option to freeze your credit is under ""about credit freeze"", deliberately passive in their use of language
* the description about credit freezing is dissuasive: ""a credit freeze may be available under your state law""
* the link for the credit freeze is also a passive ""click here"" compared with ""by enrolling in trueidentity"" language used for the link to their own product.
* clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to yet another page(https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze
* after searching through their page of bs, you finally get to the link to freeze your credit(https://freeze.transunion.com).


this is such a blatant attempt by transunion to take advantage of the equifax breach for their own financial gain. it's a shitty thing for transunion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.

"warren buffet just won his ten-year bet about index funds outperforming hedge funds. https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/how-warren-buffett-won-his-multi-million-dollar-long-bet-3af05cf4a42d

""over the years, i've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering i've learned a good deal about human behavior. my regular recommendation has been a low-cost s&p 500 index fund. to their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

i believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when i've given it to them. instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.""

...

""over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. protege funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. buffett had made his point. when looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. and when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.""",11
"girlfriend applied for a job, within 24 hours they hired her, and sent her a check for $4,000 to buy supplies. scam?. i dont know if this is the right place to post this.

my girlfriend applied to a job at a place called hci group. within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. 

this morning, she received an overnight check from patelco credit union for $4,415.

my dad used to tell me ""if it seems too good to be true, it is"". and this seems like one of those things. does anyone have any info on hci group, patelco credit union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? 

**edit** email she just received:

you're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
note: make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**edit 2** just talked to patelco. a check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. sending patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. i've read all your comments by the way! we're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.

**edit 3** scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. they threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"". i promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.

**edit 4** just wanted to do another quick edit. my girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. she goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. always be on the lookout for scam. 

**edit 5** we did not shred the check. we decided against it and are going to report it. 

**edit 6** blowing up much further than i expected this too. /u/iac74205 said i could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by usps. it came by fedex, is there a postal inspector for that?

**edit 7** we've contacted the school once to report the scam! my girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes a: reporting it to the fbi and b: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. 

**edit 8** i said it in a comment below, but i just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. i've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. the users of /r/personalfinance rock!

**edit 9** reported it to the school, this was their message: 

hi girlfriend,

thank you for sending over this information.  we have flagged this employer in handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  i know that redacted, our office manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and i will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  i will also discuss with our directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

thank you so much for reporting this!  please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**edit 10** using edits to answer faq's now. she did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. work history, name, etc. she did not give bank account details or her ss number.

**edit 11** just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, here you go(http://imgur.com/a/lfw0m)

**edit 12** i just wanted to confirm this, both patelco and hci are legitimet companies. we called patelco and they have their fraud working on it. we didn't call hci but i've had enough messages saying they've worked from hci i believe its legit. i think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

**edit 13** ladies and gentlemen, i need to give a shout out to /u/dotonfire /u/kell_naranek and /u/meanreds . they pointed out that the signature is thomas jeffersons. the dead are rising, and they're scamming /s

**gilded edit 14** i was just given gold. as much as i appreciate someone thinking a thread for asking advice is good enough to pay real money too, its unneccessary! if you are really feeling charitable, consider giving to a charity. personally, i suggest doctors without borders(https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm?source=add1600u0v53&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_expid=7773760-9.t4pemk1ytfeoymrjr_ytiq.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f) or pacer(https://pacer.ejoinme.org/mypages/donatetothenationalbullyingpreventioncenter/tabid/229451/default.aspx) . use it for something more important than bragging rights.

**final edit 15** final edit unless there's anything super important that happens. everythings been reported to the proper agencies, like the fbi. hopefully we find this guy or get a response.

nothing on our end was lost and we took all security percautions so we're safe. thank you everyone for the advice and help! 

**final edit 15.2** for some reason i can't see this post on reddit anymore besides direct link? anyways, school sent out an email blast for other students safety. **make sure to report fraud to people who can help prevent it(http://imgur.com/gallery/ms8n0)**

**final edit 15.3** i told my dad this got tons of upvotes. he replied with ""awesome"". finally my dad is proud",11
"this is just a reminder that bank of america charges $144 a year to have a basic checking account, and will change your account type over automatically after you graduate, or charge you when you're looking for a job. so if you're recently graduated, unemployed, or have another life event don't be surprised to see a $12 a month ""account maintenance fee"" if your account has a penny under $1500 at any time throughout the month.

edit: congratulations to all the students graduating this month and the next. i know bank fees are the last thing you want to be concerned about while graduating and looking for a job, but it's always important to stay on top of your personal finance and i hope this reminder has been helpful. i know many of you signed up for the account when you were sixteen. i'm glad that this made the front page of reddit and i thank the mods for stickying this for this month. if just one person saves some money from this reminder, i'll be happy.

edit 2: if you have a direct deposit of $250+ every month from your job you will also dodge this fee. this post was targeted at the soon to be unemployed so that probably isn't relevant to you however. the comments are full of alternative banks and credit unions with no such fee if you're interested in switching, and this comment covers how many of the former loopholes people used to avoid this fee have been closed.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6c35ne/this_is_just_a_reminder_that_bank_of_america/dhs1b3j/) i also saw a comment that there was a class action lawsuit when a certain amount type had this happen to them, so if you've never seen this fee you may have been grandfathered in under that account type.",11
"if you can't get your emergency fund to grow because of emergencies that keep coming up, you're still doing a good job.. over the summer i made a steadfast commitment to getting my 3 month emergency fund built, which is only about 15k. i'm saving $750 a month, which is exactly 15% of my family's post-tax income. in the 3 months since i made that change, i've had $1.8k in car repairs, $600 in vet bills, and $250 to cover a friend who got towed from our guest parking (our fault). needless to say, the needle hasn't moved as i wanted it to, and i have to keep reassuring myself that, had i not made this commitment, i'd be in real trouble covering these costs. the end goal will come eventually. 

edit: just to clarify - this is a two person budget!",11
"please, for the sake of your wallet, meal prep.. i'm slowly but surely crawling my way out of that lovely college student debt i incurred over four years and gaining financial independence. i've found out how insanely important meal prepping can be. 

every sunday, for about 2 hours, i cook and cook and cook. i make sure i make enough for my fiance and i to have lunches for the entire week. that's all it takes, two hours!  and like $40 in groceries. when i was really struggling for money, i would still find myself going out to lunch every single day and spending $10-$15 a meal. that's $50-$75 a week!  now i cook for two people for less than that. 

just a little advice and personal success here - meal prep your heart out and your wallet will thank you. 

edit: wow!  did not know how popular this would get. i can't keep up with replying to posts so i'll address two common comments here. 

1 - a lot of people keep bringing up the point that the ""cost"" of my time is not worth the meal prep and i beg to differ. these two hours i use are two hours that i would just be playing overwatch or something like that. and the money i'm saving can work for me in paying off debts and investing, so personally it's my best option.  i realize this doesn't work for everyone. i also can't take the easy way out with $5 boxes at taco bell or something similar as my body doesn't tolerate gluten which cuts out most fast food options. 

2 - every week i go to aldi and stock up on brown rice, black beans, corn, ground turkey or tofu, a bag of chicken and some veggies. most common meal prepped is burrito bowls. which is 1 pound of ground turkey, 2 cans of beans, 1 can corn, 1 jar of salsa, and brown rice mixed with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and coriander. makes 12 cups of food at 1,220 calories total. i divide this up into six 2 cup containers. then usually make chicken with veggies or gluten free pasta for the remaining two days of meals for us. utilizing four burners, a stove, and a microwave all at once produces a surprising amount of food very quickly. i store it all in tupperware for the week and it stays well. some people recommend prepping and freezing as well. are there some days where i dread eating the same meal and eat out?  heck yes, but it's not every day like it used to be. and my wallet and waistline has rewarded me greatly for that.

"to all the graduating high school seniors and those turning 18 - get a bank account that's only in your name.. for minors, it's generally required for a parent to co-sign their bank accounts.  once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name only, so you have sole control of it.  it would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.

there are a couple reasons for this.  it doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  the parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  there could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  it doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  if two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.

keep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  all they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  in addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",11
"if you start suddenly getting email/spam ""bombed"" there's probably a reason. i'm not 100% sure how well this fits here (it is financial), but i wanted to warn as many people as possible.

last week on tuesday morning i was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. they were clearly spam. many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.

i called one of our it guys and he confirmed it was just me. and the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. by that point i have over 700 emails in my inbox. they were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). after a different situation that happened  a few months ago, i've learned that things like this aren't random.

so i googled ""suddenly getting lots of spam"". turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. i started going through the 700+ emails one by one until i found an email from amazon.com(https://amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 pc graphics cards (over $1000).

i logged into my amazon account, but didn't see an order. then i checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. i immediately changed my password and called amazon..

i still haven't heard from their security team how the breach happened (if they got into my amazon account by password, or did a ""one time login"" through my email.) the spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to ""legitimate"" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. so then i'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.

either way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.

and i honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but i decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.

either way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!

edit: thanks for all the great input everyone. just finished putting 2fa on every account that allows it. hopefully keep this from happening again!",11
"your parents took decades to furnish their house. if you're just starting out, remember that it took your parents decades to collect all the furniture, decorations, appliances, etc you are used to having around.  it's easy to forget this because you started remembering things a long while after they started out together, so it feels like that's how a house should always be. 

it's impossible for most people starting out to get to that level of settled in without burying themselves in debt.  so relax, take your time, and embrace the emptiness!  you'll enjoy the house much more if you're not worried about how to pay for everything all the time.

"heads up: the federal government just filed suit against navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. this is huge.. the suit was filed january 18th 2017, by the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb) against navient. 

first, know that the cfpb has requested that the court order navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. restitution to consumers harmed by navient's conduct; 

2. disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


here are the details of the allegations: 

from consumer affairs .com(https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
>specifically, the suit charges that navient:
>> fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

>> steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

>> obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

>> deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

>> harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

from the la times(http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
>in its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

>specifically, the government alleged that navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

>however, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

>although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

>in all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from january 2010 to march 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

if you want to learn more about this, i highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the cfpb. it is very readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

you can find the original complaint on the consumer finance .gov website(http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_navient-pioneer-credit-recovery-complaint.pdf). they also summarized the complaint on their website(http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

in the spirit of this sub, i'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. including myself, as i've been paying down my navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

i'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that i haven't mentioned, i'll update this post. 

**edit:**
additional allegations: 

(since july 2011) disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(jan 2010-march 2015) using uncharacteristically vague email titles like ""new document ready to view"" to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. during this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**edit:** there is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. we will have to wait and see. lawsuits of this magnitude often take a long time to get resolved.

"my lyft/uber expenses were nearly $750 every month so i instead bought a bike for $900 and now my travel expenses are <$140. i used to lyft line or uber pool to work everyday or every other day so this was nearly ~$10 everyday so $200-250/month just for that. in addition i use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. i was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. 

so a few months ago i invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my lyft usage dramatically went down. if i am going somewhere <2.5 miles i bike. i live in sf so hills can get pretty crazy so i also avoid areas that are further in the city. its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. instead monthly bike maintenance is <$10 and i can use public transportation to go further into the city. i only use lyft/uber now if i am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.

something i thought this sub might enjoy

**edit:** a lot of questions around why i used lyft/uber and taxi so much when sf is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. 

no real reason besides i was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. i moved to sf fresh out of college a year ago and i work in tech so the salaries are pretty good. i wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact i wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and i started building a credit balance. i used to use public transportation a lot and then i moved to a place where it was a little far so i got lazy and started taking lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in i was taking it everywhere. 

i also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. bad habits are so easy to foster. but now i am more disciplined in this matter. i was careless. but i am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case i could've done it early; but that's alright because i did and made a lot of progress. 

so if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. call yourself out. block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. it might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.

**edit:** holy shit. this got way more attention than i wanted. a lot of good advice - thank you for that. thank you to all the people that were being nice. to the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. 

i did invest in a good u lock and i also have a cable lock. when i'm at work i take it straight to my desk but when i go grocery shopping i usually lock it with the u-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. it worked well so far. 

i also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and i eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. a lot of people reached out asking for advice - i will get back to you this weekend. ",11
"this article perfectly shows how uber and lyft are taking advantage of drivers that don't understand the real costs of the business.. i happened upon this article about a driver talking about how much he makes driving for uber and lyft: https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driver-how-much-money-2019-10#when-it-was-all-said-and-done-i-ended-the-week-making-25734-in-a-little-less-than-14-hours-on-the-job-8

in short, he says he made $257 over 13.75 hours of work, for almost $19 an hour. he later mentions expenses (like gas) but as an afterthought, not including it in the hourly wage.

the federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. this represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven. the driver drove 291 miles for the work he mentioned, which translates into expenses of $169. 

this means his profit is only $88, for an hourly rate of $6.40. yet reading the article, it all sounds super positive and awesome and gives the impression that it's a great side-gig. no, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.",11

"my dad just figured out he's been paying $30/month for aol dial-up internet he hasn't used for at least the last ten years.. the bill was being autopaid on his credit card. i think he was aware he was paying it (i'm assuming), but not sure that he really knew why. or he forgot about it as i don't believe he receives physical bills in the mail and he autopays everything through his card.

he's actually super smart financially. budgets his money, is on track to retire next year (he's 56 now), uses a credit card for all his spending for points, and owns approximately 14 rental properties. 

i don't think he's used dial up for at least the last 10....15 years? anything he can do other than calling and cancelling now?

edit: aol refused to refund anything as i figured, and also tried to keep on selling their services by dropping the price when he said to cancel. 

i got a little clarification on the not checking his statement thing: he doesn't really check his statements. or i guess he does, but not in great detail. my dad logs literally everything in quicken, so when he pays his monthly credit card bill (to which he charges pretty much everything to) as long as the two (payment due and what he shows for expenses in quicken) are close he doesn't really think twice. he said they've always been pretty close when he compares the two so he didn't give it second thought.

"your amazon store card is probably scamming you. i noticed a weird charge in my statement that pays my amazon store credit card off. it's listed as security 5. i didn't know what it was but the amount kept going up as my card balance went up. 

called the number and the guy answered then danced around what the name of the company was and what they were charging me for.  eventually he slipped the word synchrony and that dinged in my head the bank that issues the amazon card. so i googled (all this while still trying to get this guy to tell me what this charge was for) and found that it's an automatic form of insurance that you are put on when you open the card. it's 1.66% of your balance monthly and you have to opt out by responding to a single piece of paper mail that gets sent sometime when you open the card. 

now im getting frustrated that this guy isn't saying what the hell his company does when he just changes gear and says the full balance will be returned and the service stopped. 

it was over 1800 dollars since 2014

i'll have it back in 3 days i was told but check your statements people. 

edit: even if you use the 0% for 12 months on large purchases (which is how i typically use my card) it still charges their fee every month

edit2: i had to go to amazons chat this morning as it was still showing as being active. the representative was polite and disabled it immediately, saying the refund will come in a 1-3 weeks credited to my card.

"got laid off and now the company that laid me off is trying to hire me back at a discount.. three months ago i was laid off as part of a 60 person lay off in a small company of 125 people.  i do occupational health and safety work as i was the manager.   i was given unemployment; been searching for jobs.

fast forward 3 months, tax bill passed, etc.  i get a phone call from the president of the company asking me to come in because he has an opportunity.  he tells me things are picking back up and the company needs me back but he's trying to shop me at a discounted rate.

i had been with the company 6 years and he says he wants to give me 20 hours at 60% of what i was making to do consulting work for 4 months until my lease is up.  this seems like a super low ball offer especially because they don't have to train anyone, i already know all of the employees, i am familiar with their policies as i wrote many of them.  also after 4 months i cant get back on unemployment and having taken such a drastic pay cut i wouldn't be very well equipped to ask for more money in the future.

i feel like this is a slap in the face and i want to counter offer their 60% slap with a 125% slap back.

does this seem unreasonable??  just seeking some guidance.

"someone used my credit card and ordered two 256gb iphone x's to my house.. weird thing happened to me recently...

i received a call from visa asking if i had recently made some large purchases . i replied ""no i haven't "". 


**the charges:**


$5000 ( triggered fraud alert)


$800 (went through, iphone on contract maybe?)


$800 (went through)








the bank then told me someone just called them pretending to be me and my card was compromised.

a week later i get two packages in the mail. i open them up, two 256gb iphone x's. one silver, one black.

**i'm guessing this is what happened:**

1) the fraudsters were testing the waters with the iphones before they made the big purchase.

2) they were hoping to intercept the package .

3) they just messed up.



anyone have this happen to them? 

**edit :**

- yes the charges were reversed.

- i still have the phones

- i'm going to contact visa about what to do.

- i don't have kids 

- not on any medications / wasn't drunk 

- getting a lot of messages about people wanting to buy them. im going to try and return them. they're not for sale :p 

- i don't need legal troubles. i highly doubt they won't come looking for these phones. 

- my apartment doesn't have gas. (carbon monoxide poisoning)

- what the frick?



**wow front page! , thanks everyone for all of the responses. helps a ton!**


**update 3:00pm pst:** talked with visa & credit security agent. they told me they don't deal with the packages / returns and that i should contact the merchant/cell phone provider. i am going to be contacting the credit bureau in the morning as well.
 

**update 4:00pm pst:** currently on the phone with cell phone provider. closing any accounts the fraudsters may have opened.


**update 4:30pm pst:** talked to the cell phone provider. no account was created under my name and they can't trace this purchase to me because i don't have an account. they told me i should just wait and see if they contact me again. they said they can't accept any returns because i need an account number (which i don't have).

**update 5:00pm pst:** just realized something... the address it was sent to is a number off. my address ends in a 2, the slip ends in a 4. it does have my name on it etc. it got to my house because the delivery guys know our last name most likely. the plot thickens. i do have new neighbours , but i don't think they could pull this off. super strange. 

**update 6:00pm pst:** just checked, the address ending in 4 isn't the new neighbours, they're my other neighbours, and they're pretty old.  i don't think i'm going to get much more info on this. i'm thinking i'll wait for a while before i consider the phones mine. i don't want to open it and then get charged for it. they may even be deactivated from apples side anyways. i'll open one after one month. 
 
**update 6:17pm pst:** proof https://imgur.com/a/lvkwf

**update (next day) 12:20pm pst:** 
i just called credit bureaus. the fraudsters tried to make cell phone accounts in my name. for some reason the cell phone provider couldn't find my name on file.  it's officially identity fraud at this point, and there will be an investigation. if anyone is in canada and this has happened to you, please call your bank as well as the following numbers.

**canadian anti fraud centre**

1-888-495-8501


funny thing just happened. trans union gave me the canadian anti fraud number, and i mistyped it. i typed 800 instead of 888 and it went to a sex line. for a second i thought i had been elaborately scammed and all of the people were it on it, then i realized the mistake.

"i thought i was paranoid, but i got phished. read my shameful account of said phishing so they don't get you too.. i have different passwords for every website i log into, 2-factor authentication when possible; i thought i knew all the scams and could spot them a mile away. this one still got me. 

i was meeting a friend at a bar. two drinks in i got a call from someone identified by my phone as wells fargo. i'm fully aware this could be spoofed, but it did not raise alarm bells yet. i was at a bar i did not frequent and have gotten calls from my bank before on suspicious charges that were legit, so i answered expecting this to be the case.

the person i spoke with said they were with wells fargo and they've identified fraudulent charges on my account but they need to verify my identity before they can discuss details. they said they sent me a text message (via the cell number they just called, which is my first clue this is phishing). they asked me to read back to them the 6-digit number just texted to me to verify my id. being two drinks in, slightly expecting what this was about, i had zero alarm bells going off. my bad, this was stupid of me. i read the number to them. they suggested it timed out and i needed to read another number they texted to me. minimal time had passed, a mild spidy sense was tingling, but i still was not concerned enough to ask questions and read them a second 6-digit code.

this person then read off 5 recent charges on my account, 4 of which i recognized as legit and a 5th that was a $1000 charge to a credit card i did not own. i immediately identified this as a fraudulent charge and they said ""no prob dude, we'll freeze your card and send you a new one"". they even gave me the last 4 on the card it was coming from. i was appeased enough to continue (sadly). 

finally, they said they sent me one final 6-digit code to confirm that they were crediting my account back with the $1000 fraudulent charge. i just needed to read off the final code they texted to me. at this point things seem weird to me but they got me at a good time. i was 2 drinks in, was interrupted from hanging with a close friend i hadn't seen in months and was outside trying desperately to avoid the loud noise inside the bar but still dealing with traffic noise outside. i just wanted to be done with this. i read them the final code and they thanked me and hung up. 

at this point, i see why my phone had been vibrating constantly through this call. i had 4 emails from wells fargo. 1) your user name has been reset, 2) your password has been reset, 3) welcome to zelle! an awesome $$$ forwarding service, 4) you've just forwarded $1000!!!!!

i called wells fargo via the number on the back of my card. after being on hold for 45 min trying to get the fraud department, i start to tell my story only to have the call drop (i'm pretty sure they hung up on me). i called back and was on hold for 1 hour 20 min (my account has been compromised >2 hours by this time) to get a second person. he told me this was a scam they've been dealing with for 3 months and i needed to go into a branch with 2 forms of id to deal with it. there was nothing he could do tonight.

tdlr: dude spoofed wells fargo when calling me on my cell, requested a reset of my user name, password and approval for $1000 transfer. i stupidly read off the confirmation numbers i received via text to him, he entered them into wells fargo website to approve all these requests. wells fargo has known their customers have been getting scammed for 3 months and didn't bother to warn anyone. i now have to go into a branch, hang my head and tell my shameful story to a person and beg for access to my account because someone else has control of it all night tonight.",11
"you will get calls about your taxes, there is a 100% chance they are scams. i just received a voicemail today that said there was a ""tax fraud pending against me"" and that i should call back immediately before ""i get arrested"". please be cautious as these are scams. if you **ever** have questions regarding your taxes, go to the place you filed them and start there, then go to the irs **directly**. pro-activity is viewed highly to the irs and you can alert them you received a call you believe to be fake.

"never look at monthly payments. negotiate on the final price.. this happens everywhere i go.
car dealership, ""so what do you want your monthly payment to be?""
insurance agent, ""great so your downpayment is $xx and your quarterly payments are $xx""
etc..

um, i want to know what the final out the door price would be?

""well tell me what you can afford and i'll see if we can make this work for you. so how much are you looking to pay a month?""

why is this bad? because you cannot compare apples to apples with just a monthly payment. sure they can make your monthly payment super low and just extend your term to forever so they make more money. or for insurance purposes you cannot compare that policy vs another one.

also you should know the true cost of the items you are buying. sure those $150 airpods at 5 bucks a month on your credit card is easy to afford. but once you factor in that 22% interest rate over how long it takes to pay it off were they really worth the $180+ you just paid?

i feel like majority of uninformed consumers should be considering the true cost of items vs they i can afford that monthly payment mindset. no wonder people live paycheck to paycheck thinking they cannot afford to have an emergency savings because all of their money is going towards those monthly payments.

wait emergency savings? i don't need that, i have available credit on my credit cards!",11
"a story of how i just got out of paying a $1500 bill, why you should never blindly trust a debt collection agency, and always request proof of a debt owed. 😂😂😂. i got a call out of the blue a little over a month ago from a debt collection agency, saying i owed almost $1500 from an ambulance ride i took because of me being involved in a car accident over 2 years ago.

while on the phone with the debt collector, i looked up debt collection laws, and after a couple minutes of research decided to request a debt validation letter, which they are legally required to send me within 5 days of initial contact. 

long story short, never received it. instead they sent me a ""verification of balance"" letter. which immediately told me ""holy shit, they don't have proof i owe the debt. which means i'm not legally required to pay this shit.""

today, right before the 30 day cutoff, i receive another call from them attempting to collect the debt. i request to speak with a supervisor. after going back and forth with him for a few minutes about why they haven't sent me a debt validation letter (which they're required to do under the law), he transfers me to his supervisor. 

this is where it gets fun. i'm now going back and forth with him. after a few minutes he puts me on hold. roughly 3 minutes later he comes back on and says ""sir, after reviewing your file, it doesn't appear we have the documentation required, pertaining to the original bill, in order to send you a debt validation letter. however i am showing you have a balance owed here in your file of $1,410.54. would you like to pay a portion of it now, set up a payment plan, or...?""

holy fuck. 

this dumbass just admitted to me they don't have proof of me owing the debt. which means im not legally required to pay it. it's null and void. 

i tell him this, he gets flustered, and after some more back and forth, basically tells me to have a nice day and hangs up the phone.

i'm going to still send a letter requesting a copy of the debt validation letter via certified mail with a return receipt requested, to cover my ass. and when they don't, because they aren't able to, it's a done deal. 

if they try to put it on my credit report, i just contact the credit agencies with proof of me asking for the debt validation letter and never receiving it, and it gets removed from my credit report. 

moral of the story, always ask for documentation. don't let debt collectors scaring you into paying a debt you may not be required to pay.

here's the bogus ass letter i received. http://imgur.com/yg9udzh

edit: this seems to be a pretty common question, so i'm editing it into the main body of my post. i'm being asked if i actually even rode in an ambulance and if i did i should just pay it.

i was involved in an auto accident because some girl ran a red light and tboned me going 50m.p.h., and i had to take 2 ambulance rides because of it. 

i contacted my attorney and he sent me an itemized list of all debtors paid after the settlement which was finished 2 years ago. 

there was a couple ambulance companies listed on there, but the amounts did not match the $1410 this debt collector was claiming. and without an account number, or any sort of identifying info, i was unable to match it to either of the paid ambulance bills in the documentation i received from my attorney. 

thus me attempting to clarify this with the debt collector, via a debt validation letter.",11
"(update) found out i was being paid less than entry level employees, what do i do?. hey guys! a couple weeks ago i posted about a situation at work where i was promoted to an admin and clinical position, and found out that i was being paid at least a dollar less than entry level employees. i was making $14/hr while others were making anywhere between $14.50 - $15/hr. i asked for advice, and the post blew up, to the point where i had to delete do to me being careless with personal info. i received a lot of advice to search for another job, negotiate higher than i was asking, and some pm's asking for my name and location and position in the company, which led to me deleting the post.

anyway, i met with the woman in charge of wages for my company, and the talk was very friendly and transparent. she said the person hiring people before me was ignoring protocol and absolutely should not have hired people at that rate. she said our range was significantly lower for hiring and that was a mistake on the previous person's end, since she showed me proof of emails that went on between everyone. 

i listened and acknowledged, and said ""i understand, but where does that leave me?"". originally they offered me a .25 cent raise which would bring me to $14.25, which i quickly countered and explained, calmly, why that wasnt a fair compensation. ""i feel with my qualifications and my value of being the only fully certified employee at my location, i think a .25 cent raise would not be very fair to reflect my role."" 

after 20 minutes, she realized i had never received my mandatory 90 day evaluation for a wage increase, never received raises for certain goals met, and other factors. i received a $1.50 raise to $15.50/hr, and i will be up for review again in april when my annual review comes up, where she said ""with everything you have done, the minimum you will see your wage go up is another $1.50. i would expect to be up to at least $18/hr when your eval is due, most likely more."" i requested that in writing so i'd have it and she happily obliged!

tl:dr - was being paid less than entry level employees, negotiated professionally thanks to advice from the sub, received a raise with another one coming in two months.

edit - forgot to mention, full back pay for the time worked :) also edited our irrelevant company info 

edit 2- im going to acknowledge this because i've been seeing a lot of people saying its a low wage and i should leave. ill admit, its not an ideal wage, however, the overall career benefit towards a higher wage and career is well worth it. they pay for graduate school in full, which benefits me as it is a top university they are affiliated with for my career path. they offer a lot of benefits most companies similar to mine do not offer or offer at a high cost to the employee. im well aware i could be making more, but something people on here forget sometimes is, life satisfaction. im happy where i am, and yes the wage isn't perfect, but i love what i do and i wake up every day excited to work, not dread it. i do look at it as a paycheck, but i am not unhappy. 

edit 3- didn't realize this would generate hate. well i'll break down even more: whether hr is screwing me with this new wage is honestly whatever you guys think. in my opinion, they took care of me as best they could. this is a position that doesn't require a degree, and hopefully when i receive mine this may, it will go up more in pay. the takeaway from the post was supposed to be that i was able to get a higher wage by being professional and collected. those of you saying to leave a job i'm happy at for money it baffles me. yes, i was unhappy with my pay when i found out, now that's fixed and i'm 100% happy again. it's a shame i have to explain that to reddit, but seriously, being happy and making okay money is perfectly fine for me. because this path and company will allow me to do both if i invest the time now. it's not about making a lot of money right away, it's about learning and perfecting your skills to make more money. i just get lucky enough to have both.

"seriously, get and use a credit card. i've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. there are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. that's all. there are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. here are a few:

**it's safer!** when you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.

compare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. you have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. and if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. 

**it builds your credit.** when you use a credit card responsibly, it will build your credit over time. which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.

the caveat here is that you never miss a payment. ever. a good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. you should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.

**purchase protection.** a lot of major credit card companies (like american express and discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. this is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen tv or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. some features are:

* accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.
* better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? the credit card company will cover the difference.
* theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you
* extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iphone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. 

and many more.

**the credit card company will reward you for using it.** most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. same applies for paying bills. so by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.

some tips on using a credit card: 

* never miss a payment. ever. you will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.
* only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. this is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.
* pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. when you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.

hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. they're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.

here's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. a couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. the purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. my bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. all i had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. never had to deal with it again. granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.

i applied for my first credit card the day i turned 18. i now have four credit cards with $50,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 780 at age 23. all it took was a little persistence and responsibility. if i can do it, believe me, so can you.

"in order to get the lowest lease price possible, you must learn how to calculate a lease. here's a long and in-depth guide to how leasing works, plus real world examples from my most recent lease.. edit: i don't know if this shameless plug is allowed, but this post was so popular and it resulted in so many people messaging me over the last year that i decided to spin up a little company to help people negotiate their leases. i'm always happy to answer any questions on this post if you pm me (as i've done for dozens of people), but if you want someone to actually do the work for you or spend some time finding deals for you, then please don't hesitate to message me for more details. i am not so shameless as to list the company or website here, so just pm me if you want more info on having someone taking care of the lease for you.

i have seen a lot of posts recently about best practices with car buying, but i haven't seen anything on _how to_ lease a car. so i figured i'd write this up! 

ok, let's get this out of the way right away: leasing isn't for everyone. in fact, it's probably a bad idea for most people. but if you are going to lease, you need to know how leases work and where they get the numbers in order to get the best deal. and knowing the numbers may actually make you realize it's a terrible deal and to stay away. 

but for this post, i'm not debating the merits of leasing, just explaining how the math works, what your costs actually are and how to realistically minimize those costs. 

this post will include the following info:

- the math behind the calculation
- what kind of car to look for
- where to find the info you need
- how to negotiate the best lease

***the math***    

let's start with how the lease monthly payment is calculated. 

the formula is: payment = depreciation + finance charge.    
your depreciation is: ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months)   
your finance charge is: ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor   
so your total formula is: payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

pretty simple right? so what do those things mean?

capitalized cost: this is the amount financed. did you know in a lease, you are actually financing the depreciation? this can be higher or lower than the price of the car, depending on whether or not you are putting money down, rolling over negative equity, or tacking on fees into your payment. the lower the better!

residual value: this is what the manufacturer (or the bank, if using a separate lease provider) thinks the car will be worth at the end. it's expressed as a percentage. 50% or 0.50 means they think it will be worth half as much in the end. the more miles you want, the lower the residual will be. residual can also vary by trim package (i.e., the ""limited"" has a higher residual than the ""sport""). the higher the better!

money factor: this is the interest rate. for some reason, it's always actual interest rate / 2400. so 4% = 0.0016 and 0.9% = 0.000375. the lower (more zeroes) the better!

number of months: how long you want to lease for. sometimes manufacturers juice the leases depending on months. for example, vw wanted to move jetta glis off their lots a few years ago, and had insanely inflated residuals and ridiculously low money factors on 2 year leases, making them about $100/mo less than a 3 year lease.

refundable security deposits: this is expert level leasing. almost no one knows about it, even dealerships. but some banks allow you to put down a refundable security deposit in order to lower your money factor. this is usually for people with low credit to secure the rates of someone with higher credit, but some let people with top tier credit put down money to get an even lower rate. i was told by the finance manager and the sales manager at one toyota dealership that i was wrong. i asked them to call toyota, and they came back and said ""well, you learn something new everyday"". if you are doing a refundable security deposit, simply calculate if the reduced payment on your lease will be higher than the guaranteed return on your money. in other words, if you put down $3000 and get $20/mo off, at the end of 3 years you'll have $3000+20x36 = $3,720. that's a 7.44% guaranteed return!

***type of car to look for***   

to get the cheapest lease possible, you want to find a car that the manufacturer is discounting (this will reduce your 'cap cost'), which has a naturally high resale value (think honda or toyota), and a low money factor (triple zero!). 

you can monitor for specials, search online for deals, or call around when you are looking for a car. if manufacturers are advertising cheap lease deals, it probably means they are either discounting the car or offering a really cheap money factor. just realize that if it's being advertised, you can do better by negotiating. 

as with anything, google is your friend as well: i got my parents a great lease deal by googling ""current lease deals"" and finding out that mazda was basically doing interest free leases - they're driving a $30k car for $315 a month, with zero money out of pocket.

***where to get the info***   

so now you know you want to lease a car. you need to start filling in the blanks. what are the sources of this information:

- dealerships. they won't tell you easily, but if you make it clear you are a serious buyer, they'll share the real info with you. i've found that sales managers and internet departments are the most likely ones to share the info.
- edmunds tmv. this a great source to find out how much cars are actually selling for in your area. you can option the car and price it out and see if it's realistic to get a car below invoice or at msrp or somewhere in between.
- cargurus. i've found this site/app super helpful for knowing what specific cars are available in an area, what the average price is, and how long the car has sat for.
- edmunds vehicle specific forums. this is the best source i've found for up to date residuals and money factors. the mods of the forums answer specific questions on current vehicle offers.
- google. if you google ""money factor + residual + make/model"" you might find another source that will break it down for you. 

i like to find all of the numbers, plug them in, figure out what the monthly payment would be, and then start calling dealerships to confirm my numbers are right. this makes negotiation easy - figure out what you want to pay, figure out a reasonable price, and then find someone who will sell it to you for that. speaking of...

***the negotiation***   

here's where it can get tricky. even if you know the numbers and know what you're trying to do, they'll still try and add stuff on. there are curveballs everywhere. 

also, it's going to be rare that you'll find a sales person who will dive into calculating at this level. they will ask you about monthly payment, your trade-in, what you want to pay. you need to be firm and stick to your plan. the last time i leased this led to me walking out of one dealership after they wouldn't play ball. their loss, i walked into one the next weekend and leased the same car for less than i was willing to pay at the first one. 

the key strategy is this: _focus on the sale price of the car_. you already know the money factor and residual. those are driven by the bank and the dealer can't budge (unless they find you another bank). you want to negotiate the lowest sale price possible. this is where the edmunds tmv and cargurus info is so helpful.

do not talk about down payments. do not talk about monthly payments. do not talk about trade-ins. do not talk about _anything_ except the sale price of the car.

why is this so important? because the residual is always calculated based on the msrp of the car. but the closer the residual is to the sales price, the less depreciation you are financing. so the lower ""sale price"" you can base the lease on, the cheaper your payment!

some other tips to think about when negotiating: 

- never put money down. all a downpayment does is reduce your cap cost. but if you drive off the lot that day and get slammed by an 18 wheeler and have the car totaled, you'll never see that money again. never put money down.
- if you can, sell your car privately. don't trade it in on a lease. why? see above. it's money, and it may disappear. there are obviously exceptions to everything, but in general, don't trade a car in.
- watch for additional fees. dealers charge for document fees ($100-$500, may or may not be negotiable) and a host of other factors. ask for these to be separated out, then decide if you want to lease them. when your money factor is near 0, you may be ok with ""financing"" these costs. but you may just also want to pay them up front (note: this isn't a down payment).
- taxes: these vary by state, but in my state they're based on a prorated lease rate. so it's a monthly payment of (6.5% x calculated monthly payment) is added on to your total payment.

so what are some real world examples:

i currently lease a 2017 toyota 4runner off road premium. the msrp of my car is $40,500. toyota was running a lease special of $399/mo with $2,999 down, plus taxes and fees for a base sr5 that goes for about $37k. seems like a great deal, right? and i should be paying more for a more expensive vehicle than their current special, right?

well, i looked up on edmunds and found out that the car was actually selling for closer to $38k. cargurus confirmed this, and also showed that several were available near me and had been sitting on lots for a couple weeks. i did some research and found out the residual was high for a 3 year, 36k mile lease (i think 65%) but the money factor was kind of meh (0.00225). let's see the differences, using the msrp:

payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

((40,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 = $393.75 +     
((40,500+ (40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $150 = $544/mo .   

ok, now let's play around with this a little bit. let's remove $3000 from the ""capitalized cost"" after we learn that the average edmunds selling price is $2500 below msrp (and we're going to negotiate a little better than average).   

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $143 = $454/mo

we just dropped almost $90 off the price by knowing what we can actually get the car priced out. how do we lower the price a little more? turns out, toyota will drop the mf from 0.00225 to 0.00153 if you put down $3600 in fully refundable security deposits, returned in full at the end of lease completion. let's run the math again.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500*.65)) x .00153) = $98 = $408/mo

another $50 off. we dropped our interest rate from 5.4 to 3.67 and the price came down accordingly. 

now, let's plug the same numbers in and push for a dream price: $36,500. that gets my payment down to $379. with a tax of 6.25%, my final payment will be ($379*.0625)+$379 = $402. since my goal is $400, it's now to time to call some dealerships and see if they'll play ball.

i took out my cargurus app, found what was on their lots, did the exact math based on exactly how they were optioned (typed the same exact cars into edmunds), and then made specific offers and was transparent about the info i knew:

""hello dealer, i see you have a 2017 4runner on your lot with xyz options. i believe the residual is 65%. my research tells me the money factor is 0.00153 with a $3600 refundable security deposit. if you'd be willing to base a lease off of a cap cost of $36,500 with no money down, then i will come in today to sign paperwork"".

notice a few things: i share numbers that show i'm serious and have done research. i make an offer and tell them i'm ready to close the deal. i don't mention monthly payment. i confirm the numbers. 

the results of this effort: two dealers were interested. one dealership told me to come in, then wouldn't move off msrp. when i complained to head of biz dev at the dealer, he told me i obviously worked for toyota - ""why don't you just use your own discount to order it from the factory?"". he was serious too, and said that no one who wasn't in the car industry would have the knowledge or info i had. i sent him links to cargurus and edmunds and never went back. the other dealer told me to come in.

now here's where it got interesting. the sales manager asked if i'd be open to working with another bank besides toyota. he brought out a sheet from a local credit union and shared their numbers (this is something i've seen that happens when you make it clear you know what you're talking about and are serious about buying: they stop bs'ing you). 

the money factor on this bank's lease was .00165 (3.96%). higher than toyota's lowest, but no security deposit. and the residual was 0.68, also higher than toyota's.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .68))/36 = $276 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .68)) x .00153) = $107 = $384/mo

another $25! now this is getting good. now's when we started the real negotiation. i pushed for $36,500 and said i'd sign on the spot. we ended up settling on $36,900 after some back and forth. 

final price: $366 for the car, $23 for the tax, $389/mo total, $1500 out of pocket, $40,500 car.
what was toyota's advertised deal at the time? $399/mo, $3000 down (includes fees), for a ~$37,000 car.

so by knowing how the lease works, i got significantly more car for less money per month, no money down, and the same out of pocket costs!

now, we still had to finalize a couple other things:

- gap insurance: you need this on a lease. the bank i was leasing included it, but apparently toyota does not. so another $10/mo or so in savings.
- acquisition fee: unfortunately, the bank makes you pay an initial fee to take possession of the car. in my instance, it was about $800, which was about $150 more than the toyota lease. i could have added this to the cap cost and paid about $20/mo more, but i decided to pay this up front.
- first month's payment: varies by manufacturer, but i chose to pay this up front as well.
- plates, title, registration, etc: varies by state. i paid them up front as well
- document fees: dealerships often inflate these to make money, since they often don't make money on the car itself. you can push and negotiate on these, but sometimes they'll waive them and sometimes not. and if they do waive them, you'll probably pay for it in the sale price of the car. i'm ok with a business making some money, as long as i know exactly what it is. i paid this up front as well.

if i had rolled all of those fees into the lease, i would have basically been financing $1500 at 4%. now there's the argument that if i rolled it in and got into an accident, the gap insurance would basically pay for it. overall, it would have added about $50/mo to the cost of the lease, so i paid it all up front.

so in the end, i took possession of the car for $1500, didn't have a payment for 30 more days, and now owe $389/mo for the next 3 years on a $40k+ truck. if i want to buy it in the end, it's simply the residual cost ($27,540). if i choose to buy it out before then, it's simply a matter of getting a loan or writing a check for the current buyout price that month.

so to summarize, if you are going to lease:

- know how a lease works
- use your internet resources to find out the current manufacturer rates for your car, but be open to different banks
- learn the points to negotiate the lease on
- don't negotiate monthly payment
- reach out to multiple dealerships, but be straightforward, respectful, and up front.
- don't put ""money down"", but realize it may make more sense to pay some things up front.



***bunch of edits/follow-ups:*** 

- well, i didn't expect the front page and 2 golds (thank you!). i was just trying to do a knowledge dump that i could share if people had questions on their lease. i always assumed my pitbulls or cat would be the thing that got me to the front page.
- the audience was /pf, which is generally against leasing. i wasn't interested in that debate, and there are plenty of sources out there to decide if a lease is for you or not, or when it makes sense and when it doesn't. leasing isn't necessarily the cheapest way to drive (although it can be), but sometimes there's more to life than spending the least amount of money as possible to make it through your day. but there's no reason to overpay for something that you are getting, especially if understanding how it works can save you money. 
- if you are going to lease, please do more research than this post! i was just sharing what i've learned. i wanted to share the numbers from mine to show how the payment can go up and down, and then shared where i found the numbers and how i approached the process. not trying to claim it is the *best* way, just that if you are going to lease you should understand the mechanics of it.
- i got a few pms and messages that i said not to put money down and then i did. this is a valid criticism. the first payment is due at some point and i'd rather use my rewards card than ach for that, so the only out of pocket money i paid was the acquisition cost, doc fees, and title/reg, which was about $1100 total. in hindsight, i should have just rolled that all in and had a higher monthly payment. at the time my reasoning was that it's not cap cost reduction and i didn't want to ""finance"" the acquisition cost. in hindsight, the same logic applies - if the car got totaled, i'd be out that money. so do as i say, not as i do!
- thank you to everyone who provided feedback on typos and errors. i believe i fixed all of the math format edits and mixups on switching cap cost and msrp. if you see any other errors, feel free to pm me and i'll fix them.
- several people mentioned leasehackr.com. it's an awesome site and has a great calculator. if you aren't comfortable with building your own spreadsheet, just use theirs! they also have great breakdowns on things like the deal of the month if you are just looking at getting cheap leases.
- as someone said in the comments, please be respectful to folks if you're buying a car. i personally think having #s and doing research makes it easy for everyone because it removes the ""is this guy bs'ing me?"" part. even the dealership that i walked out of in frustration, i thanked the sales guy for his time and told him to call me if his sales manager was willing to budge on price. but the dealer i did buy from, the sales manager said ""you'd be surprised how many people think i'm trying to screw them when i offer leasing through our 3rd party bank"".

and finally, i'll say it again: if you are going to lease, please research beyond this post. don't make 3 year commitments for thousands of dollars based on one guy's post! hopefully my post helps you understand a little more how it works and provides a starting  point for research, but it wasn't meant as a be all and end all comprehensive guide!",11

# best of the best

*obviously, these are my personal opinions.  this is not financial advice for your situation and you should do your own research before applying for any cards*

## best all categories cash back

### if spending < $1,000 / mo.
**citi doublecash** 2% interest with no annual fee and no restrictions makes this my current catch-all card.

### if spending > $1,000 / mo.
**alliant cu signature visa** if you plan to spend more than $11,800 / yr on this card then 2.5% cash back more than covers the $59 annual fee, especially in the first year when all purchases receive 3% cash back.

## categories

### you choose

**us bank cash+** select 2 categories of your choice and receive 5% cash back up to $2,000 / qtr is just about the best i found anywhere.  pretty much the only way i found to beat this is with a small army of cards dedicated to separate categories.

### dedicated
**costco** and **amazon** amazon nets 5% and costco nets 4% back total on purchases with those retailers if you have a membership.  so if you already have a membership and frequently shop at costco / amazon both of those cards seem like pretty good deals as well.

## promos

### by %
**chase freedom unlimited**, **us bank cash+**, & **bank of america cash rewards** all offer $150 when you spend $500 in the first 3 months which is an astounding 30% back!

### by $
despite the annual fee **capital one savor** offers a $500 promo if you think you are going to spend more than $3,000 in the first 3 months.  personally i am not a fan of the annual fee associated with this card, but if you are just about those promo offers, $500 is nothing to scoff at.

# summary

selfishly, i made this list for myself as i was deciding which cards to apply for.  i already have strong credit, but i wanted to find cards that i could keep open long term to build my credit as my lifestyle changes, so my #1 rule was ""no annual fees.""  without an annual fee there is no penalty to keeping the account open by purchasing a snickers once / qtr so my average account age can grow.  while there are a few cards with annual fees that have nice benefits, i personally didn't find that they wound up outweighing the chance that my lifestyle would change or a better card would come along and i would need to close the account.

**personally, i wound up applying for the citi doublecash & us bank cash+**.  if i find that i am spending more than $1,000 on the citi doublecash i will probably apply for the alliant signature visa since i will be over the breakeven point.  as for the us bank cash+, i really like this card because i can see keeping it open for quite a long time due to it's great rewards and flexibility to adapt to life changes.

*please let me know if i made any mistakes or if you have a better card that should be on this list!*

i can't keep up with all the comments so i am just going to list suggestions here without all the details

"equifax will allow consumers to lock & unlock their credit report for free for life. interim equifax ceo's message in wall street journal:

on behalf of equifax , i want to express my sincere and total apology to every consumer affected by our recent data breach. people across the country and around the world, including our friends and family members, put their trust in our company. we didn't live up to expectations.

we were hacked. that's the simple fact. but we compounded the problem with insufficient support for consumers. our website did not function as it should have, and our call center couldn't manage the volume of calls we received. answers to key consumer questions were too often delayed, incomplete or both. we know it's our job to earn back your trust.

we will act quickly and forcefully to correct our mistakes, while simultaneously developing a new approach to protecting consumer data. in the near term, our responsibility is to provide timely, reassuring support to every affected consumer. our longer-term plan is to give consumers the power to protect and control access to their personal credit data.

i was appointed equifax's interim chief executive officer on tuesday. i won't pretend to have figured out all the answers in two days. but i have been listening carefully to consumers and critics. i have heard the frustration and fear. i know we have to do a better job of helping you.

although we have made mistakes, we have successfully managed a tremendous volume of calls and clicks. and we're getting better each day. but it's not enough. i've told our team we have to do whatever it takes to upgrade the website and improve the call centers.

we have started work on our website, and i see significant signs of progress. i won't accept anything less than a superior process for consumers. we will make this site right or we will build another one from scratch. you have my word.

the same goes for the call centers. there is no excuse for delayed calls or agents who can't answer key questions. we will add agents and expand training until calls are answered promptly and knowledgeably. i will personally review a daily report on their operations.

we will also extend the services we are offering consumers. we have heard your concern that the window to sign up for free credit freezes with equifax is too brief, so we are extending the deadline to the end of january. likewise, we are extending the sign-up period for trustedid premier, the complimentary package we are offering all u.s. consumers, through the end of january.

we hope these immediate actions will go a long way toward addressing the concerns we are hearing from consumers. we know they won't solve the larger problem. we have to see this breach as a turning point—not just for equifax, but for everyone interested in protecting personal data. consumers need the power to control access to personal data.

critics will say we are late to the party. but we have been studying and developing a potential solution for some time, as have others. now it is time to act.

so here is our commitment: by jan. 31, equifax will offer a new service allowing all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data. the service we are developing will let consumers easily lock and unlock access to their equifax credit files. you will be able to do this at will. it will be reliable, safe and simple. most significantly, the service will be offered free, for life.

with the extension of the complimentary trustedid package and free credit freezes into the new year, combined with the introduction of this new service by the end of january, we will be able to offer consumers both short- and long-term support for their personal data security.

there is no magic cure for data breaches. as we all know, every organization is at risk. when consumers have access to our new service, however, the cybercrime business will become a lot more difficult, and we are committed to doing what we can to help millions of consumers rest easier.

mr. rego barros is interim ceo of equifax.",11
"you do not have to give your employer 2 weeks notice.. i have seen my company terminate 2 other employees as soon as they gave their 2 weeks notice.

i gave my 2 weeks notice on wednesday and on friday was told they were terminating me and they were not intending on paying me for the remainder of the 2 weeks. fortunately i am able to start monday with my new company.

as a word of warning, if you have seen your employer terminate any employees as soon as they give notice do not give notice. you are not legally required to give notice, and if the company does not give the courtesy of letting employees finish out their 2 weeks they don't deserve the courtesy of 2 weeks notice.

edit: to clarify generally speaking you should give two weeks notice, but it is not required, and there are situations that you should not. carefully judge for yourself.",11
"as a former car salesman, these are the common fallacies that people used to justify purchasing a new car.. there are 4 basic reasons people came in to purchase a car.

current car is messy:
i sold a ton of cars to people who's current car they hated simply because it was dirty. some elbow grease or paying for a good detail could have saved them $20k.

wanted new technology:
i sold $50k cars weekly because of bluetooth capabilities. no matter how old your car is, you can add this to any existing car for around $200. cheaper if your diy.

wanted it as a status symbol:
cars always look amazing at a dealership where they are waxed, clean, and smothered in armor all and tire shine. in two weeks the difference between your old car and your new car will probably be negligible. the whole status symbol thing really only lasts a few weeks. most of your peers don't know the difference between a new and much older models if they are both dirty.

mechanical problems:
this is the only reason i would advise anyone to purchase a car. eventually the repairs get to the point where its more expensive to keep it than to move on. if you are buying a car for anyother reason than this... don't!

edit: reading the comments, i figured i should address some general thoughts. 

safety isn't something i meantioned before, but probably should have. regardless of how reliable a car is, if you are driving something with a rusted frame and 20 year old safety features its time to upgrade (assuming you can afford it). my wife and kids drive in a 5 star crash rating car with every modern safety feature. we have chose to be stingy in other places in our finances so we can afford to have a car with these types of features. its worth a little bit of money to us to know our family is safe and to be able to see when backing out of the driveway. 

that moment when repairs out way the cost of upgrading is tricky. i have been burned several times by spending money on repairs that i thought were a good investment only to have more and more repairs pile up. i wish i knew some perfect rule for this. i don't. i have repaired cars i shouldn't have and i have gotten rid of cars that probably would have been great with minor investments.

"i negotiated salary for the first time ever, and i got what i wanted!. last tuesday, i did something irresponsible for the sake of my mental health and quit a job where i was miserable, without another job lined up. as the sole income provider this was a huge gamble, but i had an interview on friday that i was feeling really confident about. 

i should pause here to note two things: 1) i'm a codependent, and avoid conflict like the plague. 2) i am this way because of my childhood, being raised by my narcissistic mother. my former boss was exactly like her, hence why i left. 

so, i killed the interview on friday. met the two attorneys i would be working for. they are amazing and offered me a job at the end, but said that they would need the senior partner's approval first, so to wait for his call. 

i got the call this morning. we went back and forth a little bit. my starting point was $x, he wanted to offer x-$7k. he noted that health insurance is 100% employer-contributed, and not only was i getting 2 more weeks of pto than my last employer, but i would get pto on my bday (this is actually an awesome perk because mine almost always falls around a federal holiday, which means the potential for a paid 4-day weekend).

i said meet me at x-5k, so he said he'd do x-7 but cut me a personal check each month for gas allowance. when i incorporated that in, i was almost sold. my husband told me to ask for an additional $50. what's the worst he can say, no?

well, codependent me was terrified to ruffle the feathers. but i thought, although beggars can't be choosers, i'd potentially miss out on an extra $600 a year for the sake of not hurting someone's feelings. 

so i asked. and he actually said that he was taken aback, and felt like i was nickel and diming him! but you know what? i stuck with it. i said, ""yes, well, i am very eager to start, so if you can meet me there, i can start tomorrow."" he said he had to get back to me.

and wouldn't you know, he did. i got that extra allowance. i stuck to my guns. i put conflict aside to make sure he knew right off the bat that i know what i am worth. and it felt amazing.

you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. and let me also just add that it feels really good knowing you're earning a salary you can support a family on, and that you made it happen by being assertive. it's just a huge weight off my shoulders, that i won't have to worry about whether i can pay all the bills on time.

"my credit union offered me an appointment with a financial advisor after depositing an inheritance check. when she called i asked if she was a fiduciary. she said yes. when i showed up i found out she's actually a broker but ""considers herself"" a fiduciary. this is some bullshit, right?. i'm extremely annoyed. i feel that i've been subjected to a bait-and-switch. when she called to set up an appointment, i said ""before we do that, are you a fiduciary?"" she said yes. i said ""great, i'd love to set up an appointment!"" when i got there i saw a plaque on her desk saying she was a broker. i read online that a broker is not the same as a fiduciary. i asked her about it and she said, ""let me explain to you what a fiduciary is... blah blah blah... so i consider myself a fiduciary."" 

she thinks that i, 30, should invest my inheritance in a deferred annuity for retirement. i have ~60k earmarked for retirement and the rest of the inheritance earmarked for current emergency fund and paying off current bills.

"my fiance just got unexpectedly fired today and we're both now reminded why r/personalfinance is always insisting on trying to live off one income.. we were both blindsided by today. we're both pretty young, early on in our careers, he had only been there a year and was performing. it was a huge shock. we don't practice every best habit of the sub but we're grateful we picked up doing your best to live off one income.

we just bought our house in august and insisted on going through the pre-approval process off my income alone.  our lights will stay on because our bills are effectively scaled to one income as well. we held off on car payments and continued to drive our beaters because the numbers for new used cars didn't make sense with one income.

my only regret is not building up our emergency fund more (one month saved but we should've had at least three), so if you're reading this, definitely do that.

anyways, thanks to the sub for the constant advice on living below your means and always being prepared. i came to thank you all, not lecture. and encourage people who are following this thought process and are using a second income for the ""extra stuff"" - you're doing great. today sucked but it could've been so much worse.

we're counting our blessings and the job search begins tomorrow.

**edit:** thanks everyone for the encouragement and well-wishes. this obviously isn't the only thing going on in our lives, so the messages to keep going were greatly appreciated. 

for those of you who are in hcol areas or other situations where living off one income isn't possible, i totally understand - the intent of this post wasn't to shame anyone into anything. we live in a mcol city in the south and are in the tech sector so it was doable for us. we're also not beacons of perfection of this sub and are still working on breaking bad financial habits every day. 

for those of you who took this as a self pat-on-the-back post, i can see that. the intent really was to see the silver lining of things and encourage others who are perhaps considering this type of budgeting method. but i understand how fast this sub gets into circle-jerking and self-congratulating and didn't mean to purpose this thread for that. just hoping to reduce the amount of ""we're in deep shit from one event that could've had a much lower impact"" posts by showing anything can happen at any time and that even then, we weren't as prepared as we should've been.",11

"macy's new employees are encouraged to open a store credit card (26% apr) to obtain their employee discount. i recently picked up a part-time seasonal position at macy's for some extra holiday cash. i've been working in retail off and on over the past 15 years, and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places, but it's been a few years since i've worked for a big retailer like macy's. i was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the 20% employee discount  is only available through a prepaid card (like a gift card i guess, not terrible but not great), or through their *actual store credit card*. they conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork, and even allow you to apply right then and there.

i've been through this type of application process before, but i've never seen something so brazenly unethical. these are often young adults or older people applying for these positions, filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin, and they're being targeted with a (hard hit, thanks auto mod) hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate. is this new in retail? seems like a disturbing trend if it is.

anyone have any thoughts on this? just wanted to get the word out.

edit: thanks for the replies, everyone. really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards, business practices, and obviously pf. the consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending, as long as they are managed responsibly. i respectfully disagree, in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people (namely, new employees) that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit, but i will agree that it's fair game to solicit employees. i just think it's kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an ""easy"" solution for employees. employees should just get an effing discount, period. but we're all free to work and shop where we please, so feel free to support smaller/local businesses that don't subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations.",11
"aren't you embarrassed?. recently, i started a second job at a grocery store. i make decent money at my day job (49k+ but awesome benefits, largest employer besides the state in the area) but i have 100k in student loans and $1000 in credit cards i want gone. i was cashiering yesterday, and one of my coworkers came into my store, and into my line!

i know he came to my line to chat, as he looked incredibly surprised when i waved at him and said hello. as we were doing the normal chit chat of cashier and customer, he asked me, ""aren't you embarrassed to be working here?"" i was so taken aback by his rudeness, i just stumbled out a, ""no, it gives me something to do."" and finished his transaction.

as i think about it though, no freaking way am i embarrassed. other then my work, i only interact with people at the dog park (i moved here for my day job knowing no one). at the grocery i can chat with all sorts of people. i work around 15 hours a week, mostly on weekends, when i would be sitting at home anyways.

"if the only reason you pay for amazon prime is because of 2-day shipping, there is a good chance it's a smarter financial move for you to cancel it than continue.. this got removed from r/lifeprotips so let's see how it goes here...

i've paid for prime since it was available, and lately i've noticed it's gotten increasingly worse with shipping.

**fyi** \- prime doesn't mean you will get an item in 2 days, it means you **should** get the item 2 days **after** it ships, and there will often be multiple days between order and ship date meaning *a $119 prime membership often gets items delivered to your door 3-5 business days or more after you order*.

edit: they also no longer offer a 1 month prime extension for shipping errors(https://www.dealnews.com/features/amazon-quietly-killed-a-popular-prime-shipping-perk/2207696.html)

**example**

* you place 24 orders on amazon prime over the course of a year
* 4 of those orders arrive over 2 days after you place them online due to multiple days ""processing"" or shipping errors (for me it has been much worse than this)
* that effectively means you paid $5.95/order for 2 day shipping

look at how often you purchase, how quickly items are delivered, and decide if that's worth paying $119 for. if you only have it for the 2 day shipping there is a good chance it's not, especially when you consider many other online retailers carry the same items and now ship free with walmart (i know they're the devil but it looks like amazon might be too) even offering free 2 day shipping on many items without an extra membership fee.",11

"i raised my credit score by 73 points in 3 months and got myself out of debt thank to this subreddit. i know i still have work to do but i wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track. 

in late 2013 i was out of work for several months due to an illness, and just a few weeks after i returned to work my husband was laid off. i had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that i was left with some sizable amounts of debt, some of which went to collections. i ignored my credit through 2014 and 2015, since i honestly didn't know how to fix it. 

then i found this subreddit. i read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation, and read all of the amazing information provided here. towards the end of 2016 i finally decided that i was ready to fix my situation and get back on track. 

in october i signed up for credit karma. my credit score was a dismal 590. i thought it was insurmountable, but i took it one step at a time. i treated it like a game -- every sunday i would log on to ck (as well as several other score providers) to see how many points i ""earned"" that week. 

to start, i found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my state's statute of limitations, and disputed them. to my surprise, the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report. there is still one small $200 collection account on my report (one that wasn't disputed because i legitimately owe it), which i plan on tackling next. 

i now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month, due to poor budgeting. i signed up for mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going. i cut cable, stopped eating out so much, and cut some other unnecessary expenses. coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when i could, i was able to put over $1,000 a month into savings, when previously i struggled to save even 1/10 of that. 

next, i tackled my credit card debt. i started with about $2,800 in credit card debt, which isn't very much but my utilization was near 90%. every extra dollar i had went to those two cards until they were paid off. i paid off the lowest balance first, since the interest rates were the same for both cards. seeing that first $0 balance reported to my credit report was really nice. once my utilization was under 50% i called capitalone and requested a credit line increase, which they provided, taking my utilization down to 31%. i continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have 0% utilization across both cards. it took about 6 weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy. 

finally, i called my credit union (car loan) and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment, because it can't hurt to ask. to my surprise, they listened to me, saw that my payments had been current since i started working again, and removed 3 late payments from my report as a ""good will"" adjustment. i still have 3 late payments reported, but 3 is better than 6. 

today when i logged in to credit karma my score was 663. all of my credit card debt is paid off, my car loan will be paid off in 3-4 months and i was able to replenish my emergency fund *and* start saving towards a down payment for a house. 

seriously cannot thank this sub enough. i've never posted here before but i must have read every single post here over the past 3-4 months, and just wanted you to know that i'm grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track. 

happy new year! 

**a small edit since this post got a little more attention than i anticipated! (wow,  thanks everyone :))** 

first, i have gotten some pms and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for ck, and i assure you it isn't (lol). credit karma was one of several score services i utilized, and i initially signed up since i saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub. i mentioned it by name simply because it was the service i used (& continue to use) most frequently. i've also received some messages from people who, for some reason, don't believe that my post is true, and that was certainly unexpected. if the mods are amenable i would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted. the purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect. 

i also appreciate the advice to check my ""real"" fico score. i did that this morning and to my delight it was actually 667, so a couple points higher than my ck score :) 

i'm very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you, and wish everyone great success in the new year! ",11
"i'm a 16 year old tasked with getting my senile 67 y/o father on food stamps, free government phones, etc and i need help.. for starters, thank you for reading and no need to write in layman's terms. 

**tldr**; my dad is physically and mentally unfit to get himself on government aid and my siblings have given me the job of helping my dad get on a plethora of government assistance plans. i need help doing so. 

my father is 67 years old and has tons of mental and physical issues. he has diabetes in addition to a wide range of mental issues we think he could have. he's never been professionally evaluated, but we think he has bi-polar disorder and is a paranoid schizophrenic.  he also has a tough time speaking due to his old age and not being a native speaker. i am the only one in the world that can decipher his jumbled language most of the time. he gets overwhelmed very easily and has a hard time remembering a lot of things. he currently has zero income and it's been that way for years. we think that he is being sent money from offshore relatives but no one can be certain. we are about to sell the house next month because he cannot afford to live in it any more. my parents are divorced and my dad has no legal custody of me. we live in wisconsin. i am willing to impersonate him on the phone with people. he is totally find with it since i have to do it for him all the time. 

task 1: get him a free phone service. he has a phone already so we just need a sim card with service. 

task 2: get him on food stamps

task 3: figure out what type of health insurance he has. i've asked him for the paperwork of his insurance and he doesn't know what i'm talking about so i need a way of finding out. he definitely has something i just don't know what. 

task 4: get him on social security if he's not on it already. i don't know how i would find out since it's the same deal with the health insurance. 

task 5: get him professionally evaluated for mental illness. also find out what government assistance is available to those who are disabled mentally. 

task 6: get assistance in buying pet food. he has a cat (which is one of the few things keeping him relatively sane) and needs help caring for him.

task 7: get him surgery for his arm. his bicep sags on one arm and he can barely use it. 

tasks 1-4 are really the essential ones. i just need to know where to start and what i need. this is pretty difficult in addition to school so that's why i am asking for so much help

thank you very much for those who read. please ask any more follow-up questions you have. 

by the way, this is a throwaway account because this post contains a lot of personal information. thanks again.

"reminder: paying rent is not ""throwing away money"". one thing i see over and over again on this sub is people thinking they need to buy a house because they are ""wasting"" money on rent. this is a fallacy and not the right way to think about rent. as human beings, there are several things we need to survive, including food and shelter. paying money for rent is no more a ""waste"" of money than paying for food is. 

while it is true that when you buy a home a portion of your monthly mortgage payment will be going to principal, and therefore you *are* paying yourself in some ways, however, the cost of home ownership is significant. some of the lesser known costs include the lack of flexibility, stress, the risk of home price declines, home maintenance, real estate taxes, and hoa fees. 

i recommend looking at the following calculator for a better idea of the true cost of home ownership. 

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?mcubz=0&_r=0

also keep in mind that this does not account for opportunity cost of being able to move (i.e. you find a job in another state that you can't take because you're underwater on your home or the burdensome costs to move closing costs).

edit: i think too many people in this thread are reading this post as saying that home ownership is bad. that is not at all the point. in many situations, owning a home is absolutely preferable financially to renting. the point is that a home is likely the most expensive thing you will ever buy; it is not a decision to be rushed into simply because you are ""wasting"" money on rent. it is *not* a waste of money to rent until you have the stability necessary in your life to make the decision to buy a home. there are even some markets or situations where it may never make sense to own a home, and that is okay.

"what i wish people told me before i got $16,000 in cc debt. quick background. i got my first credit card by accident. i thought i was filling out a ""loyalty card"" at cabelas. ended up being a line of credit. i was 23. 

4 short years later and married with a baby girl, i find myself with $16,000 in credit card debt. i actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck. and when i say last dollar i truly mean it. we had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards. 

less than two years later, we now have $16,000 in savings and no credit card debt. (we finance one of our cars) 

credit card debt is crippling. my dad calls it the ultimate slavemaster. it forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life. 

here's my list and i hope it helps you. i'm no guru, i just learned the hard way. 

1. you will not pay it off later. when 'later' comes, you'll be buying other things to pay off later. 

2. read dave ramsey's money makeover. it's got good tips and the tactics work. 

3. the jones' can suck it. they're miserable and controlled by debt also. don't buy things you don't need to compete with people you don't care for anyways. 

4. pick up a side hustle. i taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. my wife picked up birth photography 

5. talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. 

6. be a bitch about your budget. set it and don't stray from it. 

7. put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 cc debt. not sure if it legit made a difference but i think it might've 

8. become emotionless toward money. i would get so pissed that i was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. it was only till i stopped giving a f#&@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. 

9. save nothing until it's paid off. it doesn't make sense to save money when you have cc debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. 

10. when in doubt... overpay. if you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the cc for 50 bucks. keep basically nothing in your bank account because ""you spend what you have."" my family could live off of $75 a week. but if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. so i would always put as much as made sense. a few times i overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. 

11. unsave your cards on amazon. so if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. 

these are just some of the silly things i picked up along the way that i think would've helped me stay out of the mess. we are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. i hope this helped!

edit: so many awesome comments! i understand these are basic tips and not hardcore financial advice. so please leave your advice, even if you disagree with my tactics because there's a lot of comment lurkers who are scanning for more advice, so keep all the comments coming!",11
"how my wife and i never fight over money. you get married and then it's living happily ever after, right? well...

a few months after we were married, my wife came home from target with a couple of large shopping bags.

*""what did you buy this time?!""*

no, i didn't say that out loud. i'm not *that* stupid. 

but the thought did run through my mind, and it concerned me.

why was i so upset over a trip to target? i love allison! i trust her, and i know she's responsible. 

she didn't come home with a new car. she didn't gamble away all our savings. so what's the big deal?

then it hit me. 

**i couldn't answer the question, ""are we okay?""**

we were married and happy except when it came to money. every day, my wife used *her* money from *her* bank accounts, and i was using *my* money with *my* credit cards. 

i realized that we were still paying the bills and shopping like we were roommates rather than like a team or a family.

and as i thought more about it, i discovered that how we used money was only *part* of the problem.

at the time, i had just started a career as a financial advisor, and i was being paid with a combination of a fixed salary and commission. the amount i was making was changing every month.

edit: i left the financial advising career about 4 years ago. wasn't for me.

allison had a stable job, but her hourly rate was low. plus, her job was centered around tourism, so the number of hours she worked went up in the summer and dropped in the winter.

at any given moment, we had no idea if we were spending ourselves into a hole or climbing out of it.

we could compare how much we were charging on our credit cards and how much money was in our bank accounts, but that got complicated. 

we had 8 accounts at 5 different banks. answering the question, ""are we okay?"" took a shit-ton longer than it needed to.

allison and i weren't working or planning together when it came to money, and i wanted to make a change.

all i wanted was to answer the question, ""are we okay?"" without getting a degree in accounting.

**we learned how to handle money as separate people.**

before getting married, allison and i really were separate people.

we both had savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards to manage. we learned how to pay bills in our own apartments with our own roommates (who were also our groomsmen and bride's maids).

allison and i ended up moving in together for the summer right before we got married, so we were--from a legal standpoint--roommates rather than a family. we got used to paying the bills and shopping as separate people.

looking back, combining our lives and becoming a family needed to happen. we realize now that this moment was inevitable, but no one ever taught us how.

**we were responsible as individuals, but not as a couple.**

i figured that if we didn't start working together with our money, the ""target incident"" would just get worse.

* if i needed a new suit for work, could we actually afford it?
* what happens when we want to go on vacation?
* would allison start to resent me for spending a lot of money on craft beer?
* would i start resenting allison for buying another purse?
* what if we go further and further into debt without knowing it?
* what if we want to buy a house?

i love my wife, and i trust her. but the way we were going, i didn't trust *us*.

**no one ever taught us how to handle money as a team.**

no one ever taught me how to handle money as a spouse. fortunately, i have great parents that i got to watch, and i learned what a great marriage could be. but they never talked about money around me.

in high school and college, i learned how to balance my checkbook, use a credit card, and pay my bills. but it's easy to make decisions when i don't need anyone else's opinion or permission.

allison and i needed to do something different, and it was up to us to change.

**we needed to find some help.**

i was on edge to begin with. trying to network, gain clients, and work long hours already had me stressed out. worrying about my clients' money didn't leave much energy at the end of the day to take care of our money.

any time we needed to go shopping was stressful. hanging out with friends made me feel guilty. we live in florida so of course we like to go to orlando (*""sea world...disney...putt-putt golfing.""*).

i wanted to worry a lot less about money, have some fun, and not ruin our marriage in the process.

it was time to find some help.

**what were the problems we needed to solve?**

allison and i already worked well as a team. we were both responsible, but we had separate financial lives that needed to be combined somehow.

i realized that the three basic problems we needed to solve were:
* how do we see all of our money in one place so we don't miss anything?
* how can we manage day-to-day decisions without nagging each other?
* how do we financially and emotionally support each other in our goals and dreams?

this took some time to figure out.

**step 1: see everything in one place.**

the first thing we did was to get everything into one place. i had been using the app, mint, for years to help track my own stuff. so we decided to start a new account. edit: i took out the link for mint to help out with the thumbnail issue. i'm guessing you can find the app just fine without it.

edit: i am not an employee of mint, nor am i being paid by them. i'm just a fan, and the app has worked well for me. the comments on this post also strongly suggest (but are not limited to) ynab, good budget, personal capital, everydollar, mvelopes, and quicken. you could also use excel, google sheets, apple numbers, or any other spreadsheet software you are comfortable with to budget and keep track of your finances.

* every savings account.
* every checking account.
* all the credit cards.
* student loans.
* car loans.
* every transaction.
* updated automatically.
* all in one spot!

the clouds parted and the angels sang.

we both had access to see everything at any moment on a computer or our phones.

**step 2: give each other permission to spend money.**

the next step was to start budgeting together, and i had to talk allison into this. she had some valid concerns, and it all started with toothpaste.

since i'm a detail-oriented person, i was gung-ho about budgeting and tracking our money. i love it when everything works together perfectly. whereas allison has more of a ""good enough"" personality. she was happy as long as we were staying out of trouble.

so when i started to talk about budgeting, one of allison's first questions was, ""if we spend our budget for toiletries and we need toothpaste, i can't go out and buy more toothpaste?""

it was a good question, and i didn't have the answer right away. over time, we've learned how to budget each month without making the budget set in stone. it's flexible, and when we need to change it...we change it. toothpaste for days!

allison also asked, ""and what if we want to go shopping on our own? do we need to give each other permission?""

the solution here was to budget fun money for each other. every month, allison gets some money that she gets to do whatever she wants with. and every month, i get some money that i get to do whatever i want with. sometimes we overspend our fun money amounts (okay, honestly...it's usually me), but we make it work out.

edit: we also have an ""entertainment"" fund in our budget every month, which is for anything we do together. you could call it ""date night"" money, too.

after making a lot of mistakes, hitting road bumps, finding solutions, and practicing, our monthly budgeting hasn't caused any fights or headaches....for years.

**step 3: decide what we want, together.**

when it came to our goals and dreams, we tried a formal system of tracking what we wanted. but it didn't really work out. it was too much for us as a couple.

our bigger goals like an emergency fund, retirement, and debt took some time, but those goals take *months* or *years* or *decades* to accomplish. once we set the plan, there was no need for a conversation every month.

for the shorter-term ideas, we developed a habit of asking each other, ""what do you want this month?"" 

sometimes i want new running shoes. sometimes allison wants to throw a party at our house for friends. and sometimes we both want a new dining room table.

in the end, we just wait until an idea pops into our mind (*""is it time to go back to disney world?""*), and we decide if we can afford it now or we need to save up. and then put it in the budget.

it's flexible, and it works for us.

**i calmed down...fast!**

after all our financial information was in one spot, i immediately calmed down. 

i had one number that showed me how much combined money we had in ""the bank"" and one number of how much we had charged on the credit cards.

one number minus the other gave me my answer. we were okay.

after we started to budget, seeing a target bag (or any other shopping bag) hasn't bothered me since.

**we never fight about money.**

allison and i have had a lot of fun with friends, visited family, and had wonderful vacations. but we have made a lot of mistakes and have had to deal with a bunch of emergencies.

we talk, discuss, and decide. but we don't fight.

"i'm going into my senior year in high school and i work a lot year round and save all my money. i should be graduating high school with a little over $30,000. what would you do with all that money after graduating high school?",11
"(can) i'm 17 years old, stranded in a rural home, taking care of dozens of animals on a $50 per week income, for an undetermined amount of time. i'm completely lost.. so, twelve days ago, my great-grandma had a stroke. my grandmother, my legal caregiver, went to the local hospital (a ripe two hour drive away) and has stayed there ever since to ensure that the doctors don't take her mom off life support. my aunt, my other caregiver, and her kids went with her.

so long story short, i'm home alone. i've been home alone for over ten days and have had to take care of the family's two sheep, two goats, five dogs, three cats, six large birds, dozens of chickens/ducks/quails/guineas, two horses, and a rabbit to boot

the people taking care of me don't know when they'll be home. they're not gonna let the doctors let my grandma die so they're gonna stay there until she dies naturally or recovers, which could be months. i've expressed my concerns through text and have only been met with ""i don't knows"" and the like. they've come home twice (for a couple hours) just to check on things but aren't making money themselves so they haven't been able to help.

i'm basically taking care of a house and all these animals alone at 17.

i'm not sure what to do. eventually bills will start popping up and the animal are already low on food.

i have a weekly shift at mcdonalds to fund myself, but in the area i live, the bus to town runs very rarely so taking full time hours isn't an easy solution. 

i go to school as well since a school bus goes through my area. (though i'd be willing to drop out if needed)

tl;dr: fending for myself, as well as dozens of farm animals, for an indeterminate i make almost no money and live in a rural area.

**edit:** thank you for your replies, i'll read them all and respond when i'm out of school in a couple hours!

**update:** thank you all for replying, i'll try to get through as many as i can but i honestly did not expect this to blow up like it did. anyway, i talked to my family and while they're not returning home, my aunt has come back with cat and dog food so the animals won't starve for now. she says she doesn't know how much longer they will be gone but don't anticipate it being months like they originally thought. i'm going off her words here. i also talked to my manager and am getting three evening shifts this week over my usual weekly one, so i'm not gonna be completely broke. the bus rarely comes through but i'm fine killing time in town if it means more money coming in. i won't drop out of school either. i was just panicked and assumed i'd have to work full time. i'll update more as events unfold",11
"how to determine if you can really afford that car. i keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment. let's have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car. here's some advice i'll give. your mileage may vary (oh yes i went there). this advice is in usd but works anywhere. 

don't get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off. i've done the math at a bunch of different interest rates, and the bottom line is that 48 months is the magic number for loan terms. at 4 years or below, you're typically safe. maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates, but there are other reasons not to finance for too long, including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life. 

next, write out your full budget and see what you have room for. here's where young folks get trapped: maybe if you're still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses, it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car. as soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz (which will very likely happen within a few years), that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes. be realistic. account for all the standard living expenses, fun budget, savings, and then be honest - what do you really have to spend on transportation each month? for a lot of people, it'll probably be a few hundred bucks. then, subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you, and multiply what you're left with by 48. that's what you can afford to finance (including interest!) 

does the number come out well under $10,000 (or equivalent low amount for whatever country you're from)? for many people, it probably does. don't be discouraged, for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand. 

does the number come out to less than $5000? very common! save up and buy a car in cash.

i feel like people tend to look at $20k as cheap for a car, but it's not cheap at all. include taxes and fees, finance over 5 years at 5% and you're looking at well over $400/mo. then tack on insurance (easily $200 for a young driver), and then tack on gas. that $20k car costs you $500-700 per month! if you aren't bringing home $5k+ each month, that probably doesn't fit in your budget. the reality is, even a $20k car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners. 

what about $30k+ cars? radio commercials make them sound so affordable, but cars in the $30k-$40k range should be seen as luxury vehicles. we're talking six figure income required. yet, so many people buy $30k suvs and get screwed by the monthly payments. please don't let it happen to you. 

i work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage. people always ask me why i drive a 10 year old car. it's because that's what i can realistically afford! society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford. it's time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets.

"update: bank of america refusing to return $700+ in fruad charges after 180+ days. solved!. we got our money back after two days! http://imgur.com/gallery/lpjxhqt(http://imgur.com/gallery/lpjxhqt)

if you are looking for information on what to do if your bank declines fraud purchases or your bank refuses to return your money, please read this so you can see what steps we had to take to get something done.

i just wanted to post an update to anyone who followed along on my post last thursday about the issue we were having with bank of america declining some very obvious fraud charges and giving us the runaround for 180 days. for those not familiar with the situation, you can read up on it in detail here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180\_days\_later\_bank\_of\_america\_is\_refusing\_to/(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180_days_later_bank_of_america_is_refusing_to/)

tldr: july 15. fruad on our debit card in texas while we were in illinois. 180+ days later, bank lies to my wife after repeated phone calls. i ask for help on reddit. it goes viral. you guys give big help.

after posting on thursday, i took the advice of several redditors and took the several steps on friday. here is the timeline of events leading up to this being closed out.

* **8:00am friday:** called  jonathan stickland, my local texas house representative and left a message explaining the situation
* **11:00am friday:** submitted a complaint to the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb - https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/(https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/))
* **12:00pm friday:** my wife called me and told me jonathan stickland's assistant had called her to gather more information and said she would be making some calls to see what they could do for us.
* **4:00pm friday:** wife called me to let me know that someone from bank of america's ""regulatory complaints department"" had called her in regards to the cfpb complaint filed earlier in the day. he called at 10 minutes before his office closed and my wife didn't get the message until after. we planned to call monday morning.
* **9:00am saturday:** wife wakes me up and says the money is back in the account as a ""misc credit""
* **9:00am today:** i call cfpb. they say the complaint is still open with the bank and they usually respond within 15 days.
* **9:00am today:** i call the number left by bofa's regulatory complaints department. leave a voicemail. wife calls him from work and leaves a voice mail
* **1:00pm today:** we get a notification from bank of america that the dispute is closed. we're done. we will wait until the notice comes in the mail before we shut our accounts and move.

i hope that anyone else in our situation now or in the future can use this to get some fast results too.

thanks to everyone who commented with advice, their own stories, and kind words to keep me motivated throughout the process.",11
"at&t ran my credit not only without my permission, but after i explicitly stated i did not want a hard hit. i called in to ask what internet speeds were available in my area. he tried to sell me on cable, which i declined. he asked for my social and my date of birth. i asked him why he needed this and he explained it was to make sure i didn't have any past due balances with at&t. i then double checked and asked him if it would hit my credit and he chuckled and said ""no no sir nothing like that"". 

fast forward an hour, i have an email stating my installation for phone, cable, and internet is scheduled(???) and then a few minutes later an email from credit karma saying i had a hard inquiry. 

called in and spoke to 3 different departments, finally to a woman to tell me she couldn't remove it because calling in to inquire about service was all the consent they needed. 

this clearly doesn't seem legal, and wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what i should do next. 

tl;dr - spoke to att, they asked for social, i made sure it wouldn't hit my credit, i was told it wouldn't, and then it did. what next?  

edit 4: filed a complaint with my attorney general. 

edit 3: filed a complaint with the cfpb. all the support and advice here has been a true blessing and i thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment with good advice and/or possible solutions. 

edit 2: i called back in, and actually had a great conversation with someone who was super understanding and willing to help. she got me to the fraud department. i spoke with dorothy. she told me that it **did not matter** that i asked my credit not to be ran. that when someone calls in to inquire about service, they are consenting to a credit check. doesn't matter if i didn't give my social, they would have used my dob or dl #. she told me that i could not speak to a supervisor as this was standard practice, and she wouldn't escalate it. she also said some calls are recorded and some weren't, and she did not help me in finding the call from my first conversation. i then asked her for a copy of this call and her response was ""i don't know if it's being recorded so i can't help you"". she had nothing to say about the rep lying to me, and she said their credit disclaimer statement didn't sound anything like a credit disclaimer statement and i probably didn't even know it was read to me. unbelievable. this is their fraud department. jesus christ. 

edit: i see a lot of folks saying ""what's the big deal, couple points will fall off in no time"". i just got an email from credit karma that a hard inquiry from 2 years ago just fell off my report, and that left me with one hard hit which was back in january. i've been working very hard on rebuilding my credit, checking quite frequently and really boosting my score. one or two points may not be a big deal to some but after working so hard to improve my score, having it lowered without my authorization or consent is devastating.

"wife had yearly review today. instead of a higher wage, they converted everyone from hourly to salary, but her overall salary reduced by 14k per year.. wife works for a very small start up company with 4 people, 2 owners and 2 employees. she is in design. past year she was working at $35/hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation. $35/hr is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles. she was on wage, not salary. she worked some ot but not a whole lot. if you calculate the standard hourly to salary using 40 hours a week multiply 52, she would have earned $72,800. she is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri 9-5. however last year we got married and had vacations here and there and she was compensated $55,000 total because of the unpaid vacations. this worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away. 

today during her evaluation, they low balled and offered  a salary of $54,000 with $3800 pto/year. health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year. the total compensation now is $57,800. they said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year (so they pretty much offered her 2018 w2). employees are not going back to wage. 

i would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours, not how many hours one worked the year prior.  if she had pto last year  or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer. now her starting salary is pretty much $27/hr so its a huge downgrade and now without ot. the owners said ""well look we are giving you pto now!"" which would offset the low ball. she is valuable at her company— 70% of products sold are her designs. the other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year (due to no degree and no experience) in case you were wondering. 

is this practice normal for an employer to use previous year's w2 to determine someones salary, especially if it works in their advantage? she will try to counter back with equity (since she started the company with them). during their meeting yesterday, they stated that employees' salary do not require 40hour work periods — only the projects need to be done. because of that she wants to request working a maximum of 32 hours a week to offset the 14k a year reduction. any advice?

**1st edit** i shouldnt have wrote this long piece and gone to sleep. i will answer everyone when i get to a computer. thanks for all your help. 
first thing, i need to recalculate her w2 because she definitely didn't take 3 months off which everyone is calculating.  a big piece is missing here. i saw that in the last 17 paychecks she got paid 43k and i need to double check

second, she is very valuable to her team. anyone is replaceable but she is more difficult to replace. she knows their vision, she came up with the  company name, and all her designs are most of the ones being sold now, plus she designed the logo, all the packaging, website, everything. everything has been her idea. when she pointed out the products to me on their website, most of them were either made by her or she had some type of influence directing the other designer. she had some creative director responsibilities too.

the reason why they are doing salary is because ""it helps employees out"" by more flexible scheduling (dont need to go in if work is all done).  this is true. however they r low balling her because they are not making any money right now and simply cant afford her right now. (its true they arent making money). she asked for equity at the first meeting yesterday and they said ""thats probably not the best idea for you because we arent worth much."" wtf! 

**2nd edit**
i am reading a lot of responses and they are all helpful but i can't respond to all of them. one thing to clarify is that i know for a fact she didn't take 12 weeks of vacation. thats ludicrous! they did shut down for 2 weeks or so during the holiday, and she didnt get paid for it. she also doesnt get paid for holidays (like during thanksgiving and such). we took a max of 3-4 weeks of vacation last year, not 12. i am going to sit down with her tonight to get the math straight.

so lately money has been pretty tight for me, i lost my job a few months ago and have been trying to uber full time to keep up payments, but its been an uphill road. recently i posted on craigslist attempting to sell my switch and xboxone, and made a deal with someone where they claimed they'd be sending me a check in the mail...

&#x200b;

so when ups showed up with an envelope i wasn't surprised. however, this check is written by the **harama entertainment corp**, for $1,550. i was only selling the consoles for $450 total. does anyone have any idea where this could have come from? is it safe to deposit? the check had no context attached to it, just the oversized ups express envelope. this seems a little too good to be true...

**update:** /u/sirglass hit it right on the money, the buyer wants me to ""hold"" the cash until his ""shipper"" can pick up the switch and the extra money in the check. i'm shredding the check and relisting my consoles asking for cash only next time. i really was trying to talk myself into thinking this could be my debt relief, but this is clearly a scam. thanks to everyone for keeping me sane.

**edit 2:** for those asking how anyone could fall for a scam like this or even consider it, it's a mixture of desperation and feeling ignorant about banking matters. as a student with bills being automatic and rent going through venmo i didn't immediately see the check as a red flag, just an ""older"" way of paying for things. also when everyone else was trying to lowball me, this guy offers me the asking price which made me want to deal with him. honestly if the check had been the exact amount and not $1,100 more i probably would have just went straight to the bank.",11
"what to do if you've been kicked out of your family home as a teenager: a pf guide. unfortunately, posts on this topic are not a rare occurrence here. teenagers are often kicked out of their home without support, sufficient money, or time to prepare in advance, but there are some resources and options for teenagers in this situation.

this guide also includes some information for teenagers who are at risk of being kicked out.

# first, please seek help

if you need help, there are confidential and nonjudgmental services with trained helpers that you can call or contact online. sometimes these services get busy. if you can't reach someone right away, please try again until you reach someone.

in the case of a life-threatening emergency, please call the police or the emergency telephone number for your country (e.g., 911 in the united states).

in addition to the below resources, consider talking to an adult that you trust and/or an independent institution or service provider with community knowledge and resources. there are many options such as:

- a teacher, sports coach, or staff member at your school

- a school guidance counselor, school nurse, or doctor

- a relative that you trust

- a family doctor or nurse

- a religious leader

- a librarian

  while most are not trained explicitly in this area, librarians tend to be resourceful and very good at research if you're feeling overwhelmed.

- a staff member at local shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, etc.

  even if you aren't interested in that specific resource, they tend to be sympathetic and familiar with local resources.

- another adult you trust

  it doesn't have to be one of the above options. someone like a friend's parent or even a neighbor may be a good option for getting advice, sorting through your options, and avoiding mistakes. most adults have a decent amount of experience dealing with government agencies, navigating complex situations, and have had their share of troubles too.

# some housing options to consider

read through all of these before you settle on which options to try first. if it starts to be too overwhelming or you need help, please reach out to one or more of the resources listed above for advice and support.

1. **if your home living situation was not abusive** and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). you can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own.

   if things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer.

   if you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. maybe they are not great people. maybe you don't believe in the same things. as long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. as they say, the best revenge is living a good life.

2. it's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. **if your home living situation was not abusive**, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home.
    - if you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the united states) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out.
    - even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. the specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well).

  contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. you shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.

3. if you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out. aunt or uncle lives in the next state? call them and find a way to get there. any non-abusive relative that you know is probably a better option than heading to a shelter. grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, step-siblings, you name it.

4. failing that, your next best bet is to contact friends, crash on a couch, and ask anyone you know that might put up with you. try to consider *any* workable and safe options. for example, your ex's parents liked you and you're on good terms? call them and ask if you can sleep on their couch for a few days until you figure something out.

5. while you're living on someone else's dime, in a place that isn't yours, friends, family, shelter, whatever it is, try you best to be on your best behavior.  that means:
 - try to avoid drugs and alcohol. if you need help with substance abuse, please reach out to some of the resources linked above.
 - try to respect any rules of the household or establishment and stay out of trouble.
 - keep your space clean and maintain your personal hygiene.
 - try to avoid being a negative presence.

6. it may be very difficult to find a better option, especially on short notice, but living and sleeping on the street is very dangerous, especially as a teenager. **contact one of the above help lines and they will help you find a safe place to sleep.**

## united states

if you're 16 to 24, job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov) is another option worth investigating (some adults with documented disabilities above the age of 24 are also accepted). under the age of 18, you will need the approval of a parent or guardian.

job corps offers free education and vocational training, dormitory-style housing, food, work clothes, and other resources to help prepare youth for independent living and the opportunity to learn skills needed for a job that's somewhat better than an unskilled minimum-wage job. it's completely free for those that qualify and are accepted into the program.

# preparing if you think you might be kicked out or may need to leave soon

1. try to avoid accelerating the process and use any time you have to save up money and prepare. your own safety comes first, though.

2. try to make sure you will have a place to stay. if you can sleep on a couch for a month and save up more money before renting a room, do it. you want to save up money as much as reasonably possible.

3. try to have your birth certificate, identification, passport, diplomas and anything else you will need. store important documents at the home of a trusted friend or family member if possible. note that your parent(s) or guardian aren't obligated to give you their copy of certain documents and you should not put yourself at risk to retrieve these because you can order a copy later (link for united states(https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents)).

4. plan for the worst case even though it might not happen. your parents may not support you going to school, fill out financial aid paperwork for you, etc. if you can't afford to pay for school on your own, you may need a different plan for continuing your education such as going to community college while working.

5. if and when you need to spend money for a place to stay, try to spend as little money as possible on rent. that usually means renting a room instead of an apartment, having some roommates, etc.

# financial accounts

- joint bank accounts can be emptied by either account holder at any time so if you're old enough to open your own bank account (18 or 19 in the united states), open a new bank account *at a different bank* from the one used by your family. local credit unions, online banks, and online credit unions are popular recommendations here. use a local credit union if you will need to deposit cash.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)

- if you're not old enough to open an account where you live, see if an adult that you trust will help open a joint bank account with you. when you are old enough to open your own account, open one as soon as possible and transfer your money over.

- sign up for electronic statements and consider using a different postal address (e.g., the address of a friend or trusted adult) so statements don't get delivered to your home.

- if you're having trouble finding an bank or credit union that will allow an adult that isn't a parent or guardian to open an account with you, the money account(https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/teen-checking-account/) offered by capital one 360 is one option in the united states.

- check your credit report(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ad5f5h/30day_challenge_1_get_on_top_of_your_credit/) and freeze your credit(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) (sign up for credit monitoring before freezing your credit).

# school

## united states

if you're still in high school, ask a guidance counselor or principal at your school about continuing your education. the mckinney-vento act is a federal law that mandates the right of students regardless of their housing status. the law provides resources and support including provide transportation, free meals, and other services.

if you have questions about federal student aid, and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless read this guide from the department of education(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/homeless-youth.pdf).

"don't sell the stocks in your retirement portfolio because of the drop in the market!. i've seen a few questions asking if investors should sell their stocks and move them into treasury bonds or a money market account. the answer is no.

markets will always go up in the long term. dips, corrections and crashes are unavoidable, unpredictable and won't hurt you in the long run. just hold onto your investments and wait it out.

the only way you can lose money when the market is down is if you sell. if you hold (or buy if you have cash to invest) you will make money in the long run.

edit: you all got me! i wrote this post to stop people from selling so that my own portfolio wouldn't lose value. as you all know the best way to manipulate the global equity market is to write a post on reddit.",11
"checking my builder's home warranty saved me $38,000 on repairs. i bought a townhome in 2009 that i now use as a rental property. last summer when i was visiting the home i noticed the floor in the kitchen had sunk a couple inches. i'd heard previously from my neighbors that they'd had the same problem.

when i bought the home, the builder had given a 2/10 warranty which covered the any defects in the foundation for 10 years. i decided to pay the $200 to submit a claim and have them inspect, fully expecting they'd find some reason to deny my claim, but they didn't.

today i have a check in hand for $38,000 and a bid from a contractor to make the repairs. if i hadn't thought to check my warranty or if i'd waited even 6 months my warranty would have expired and i would be paying that out of my own pocket.

don't forget to check to see if your repairs are warrantied.",11
sell the things that aren't bringing value to you anymore. 5-$20 per item may not seem worth the effort but it adds up. we've focused on this at our house and have made a couple hundred bucks now.. it also makes you feel good knowing that the item is now bringing value to someone else's life instead of sitting there collecting dust,11

"stop freaking out about ""the recession"". hi personal finance!

i see an awful lot of threads here about people wondering how on earth they'll possibly survive this horrible doomsday recession that is just absolutely going to happen any day now.  here's some tips:

1) there is not a gigantic country-destroying recession that is coming to ruin your life in the coming weeks.  talking heads have been predicting one ever since the last recession.  the current news cycle is little more than fear-mongering (full disclosure: i used to be a journalist).  if the current indicators that people are looking at end up holding true, it's still well over a year before things are ""expected"" to go south.  plenty of time to shore up those savings accounts, make sure you're budgeting properly (see below), etc.

2) the last recession was called the great recession for a reason - it was a harder-hitting one than those that came before.  and since it was largely based on a housing crisis, it felt even worse because people were losing their homes due to ridiculous mortgages that they never should have been offered, or agreed to, in the first place.  which leads me to...

3) just be smart.  are you living within your means now?  great!  make sure your emergency fund is in good shape, and continue about your business.  if you're overspending, take a look at your budget and see what you can cut out of it.  this is something you should be doing regardless of how the markets look.  find a cheaper cell phone plan, ditch that $100 / mo cable bill, subscribe to a slower internet package, go out to eat less often, etc.  

4) ""what about my stocks?  should i sell all my stocks?""  no!!!  do.  not.  sell.  your.  stocks.  the only exception here is if you really are completely and utterly broke otherwise and absolutely need the money.  look, i invested almost all of my life savings in late september last year.  and then watched a lot of it go away - on paper.  but guess what?  it's all back already, and then some - because i didn't panic sell.  in fact, **the best thing you can do in a recession is buy more stock!**  a bad market just means that stocks are on sale.  who doesn't love a discount?  again, i wouldn't advise buying unless you have the budget to do so.  

so there you have it, friends.  the world isn't ending.  be smart with your money, use some common sense, and be prepared to make some small sacrifices in the short term *if* a recession hits.

update 1: thanks for the silver!

update 2: i was working my first ""real"" job in 2008, but the pay was so bad that i was not investing much.  then over the next nine year, i didn't invest one single cent out of fear of another big market drop (just left it in savings).  i ran the numbers, and if i had been investing in the s&p 500 at my original rate that whole time, i'd stand to be up about $200,000 at retirement.  **i potentially lost $200k by not investing out of fear of a market turn.**",11
"are there any legitimate part time work-from-home jobs that aren't a scam?. looking to make a little extra income as a side job after my full day gig is over and also on weekends. was thinking of doing transcription, but not sure where to begin. if anyone knows of any legitimate part time work from home jobs that does not require selling items i'd appreciate it!

edit: just wanted to say i am very overwhelmed by the amount of comments on this post. please know i am reading each of your comments. thank you all for your insight! i really didn't think this post would have so many ideas!",11
"free tax filing software program offered to anyone making <$64k.. with tax season fast approaching i wanted to make everyone aware of a little-known fact that if you make less than $64,000 a year you are eligible for free tax filing and preparation(https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). 

the government has a contract with tax prep companies like h&r block that allows for free tax filing for 70% of americans. you can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the irs's website. the program opens in january to file your 2017 tax returns.

the irs's advertising budget for this program is $0 so very few people realize it exists. last year only 2% of eligible taxpayers used this system. most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they weren't aware of this great program. it is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free. 

*if you're interested in why companies would offer their products for free it's because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option. so long as tax companies offer free filing to 70% of us taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option, per the contract. they just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes.* 

**use this program and please tell everyone you know so they can take advantage of it too.**",11
"eli22: personal finance tips for older young adults (us). yes, it's me....back with a second installment in our series, eli22.  this assumes you read eli18(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) ( even the links...you'll learn 10x more from the links!) and have done  things pertaining to your situation.  

the ""22"" here  means you're done with full-time education, have a career with meaningful income, and are responsible for your own support.  some people start this at 18, some at 26; age is not important.  specifics pertain to the us in some cases.  this assumes you are a single childless renter employee; eli30(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/) will cover marriage, home ownership, and children.

you have money now, congratulations!  read this(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) excellent summary of how to handle it.  here's a ginormous flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/1rpekgq.png) showing what to do first: bills? loans?  investments?  good self-study!  we'll highlight three big ideas to get you started.

- **taxes**. your employee income is taxed / withheld like so: 7.5% of the first $118k goes to social security/medicare taxes(https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html). (we hope you will benefit in the future, too!)  then your income is taxed at higher rates(http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as you make more.  assuming no special deductions, 0% for the first 10k due to standardish deductions.  then 10% of the next 9k, 15% of the next 28k, and then 25% tax rate kicks in; this is your rate from 48k  to 102k gross income, so a popular rate.  (it's only 28% up to 200k, as well.)  this is your tax bracket / marginal tax rate.  (most states also have state income taxes of ~6%ish but they vary a lot.)  higher brackets only affect your additional income; you always come out ahead(http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/) even if more income means a new top tax bracket.   you reduce your taxes with credits and deductions(http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/tax-deductions.htm).  big idea 1 is: reduce your current taxes(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) by making less of your income  taxable.

- **debt**.  you borrow money now so you can spend it, yay!  but then you have to pay it back, and typically pay back more than you borrowed, boo!  you've lost money as a result.  the extra amount you repay is determined by the interest rate(http://banking.about.com/od/loans/a/calculate-interest-you-pay.htm); the annual rate is called apr.  
3% apr student loan?  you'll pay $30 annual interest on $1000.  not bad.  
12% apr car loan?  you'll pay $120.  not good.  
  23.9% apr credit card?  you'll pay $239.  yikes!  (never do this!)
you repay the money you borrowed, too; that's called principal.  the longer you take to repay the loan,  the smaller each payment, but the more interest you'll then pay.  it's a tradeoff.  big idea 2 is: reduce the amount of interest you pay(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) by getting lower interest rates, and avoiding / quickly repaying higher interest debt.

- **investing**.  in eli18, i noted bank interest won't make you rich.  the good news in eli22 is: investments can make you  current millionaire rich(http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/save-million-calculator.aspx).  the catch is: it takes decades, and you must regularly invest significant sums.  this why you start at 22!  the eli22  introduction to investments is based on the target date fund(http://www.finra.org/investors/target-date-funds-find-right-target-you), wherein you buy shares of a mostly stock-based index  fund  designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date 40+ years in the future.  historically, these accounts gain about 6% annually(http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) after inflation, though it varies significantly year to year.  your money doubles every 12 years, and goes up by 10x in 40 years.  (all numbers are  after taking inflation into account.)  so that $5000 you put aside at 22 could easily be worth $50,000 of today's dollars at 65.  (but, there could be years where you temporarily lose 10%, 20%, even 30%(http://www.finra.org/investors/reality-investment-risk) of your savings.  do not panic!  it will come back eventually.)  big idea 3 is: invest early and often for your future, especially your retirement.  

got the the big ideas now?   good!  let's see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your ~22-year-old self.

- retirement contributions. you are going to retire someday.  invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your 401k account(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) (or similar things with different names for government employers).  a recommended investment percentage is 10%, but it's up to you; more is better, the annual maximum is $18,000.  the cardinal rule is take the match(https://www.smart401k.com/resource-center/retirement-investing-basics/company-match) if you have one.  a typical employer adds 3% of your salary when you contribute 6%, so that's like free money.  take the match.  (your actual match depends on your employer's rules.) the  money is invested for you, available penalty-free when you retire after age 59.5 (usually.)  if you change jobs, the money can go  with you.  a 401k can only invest in what your employer offers.   most employers have target date funds, so choosing one is an easy decision.  if you need or want to, you can sometimes achieve an  even better result by picking other available choices.

- ""what do you mean 'perhaps reduce current taxes'?""  retirement savings are wery wery complicated.  (thank your  congresspeople.) a ""traditional"" 401k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income.  you pay taxes when you take the money out, deferring the taxes, but you still pay something.  if you would prefer, you can reverse this if your employer offers a ""roth"" option.  in that case, you pax taxes on your 401k contributions , but no taxes when you take the money out.  the best choice(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) is complex; for those below the 25% bracket, roth is usually better.  

- yet more retirement options: iras.  individual retirement accounts(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) are do-it-yourself 401ks.  you set up an account with a company like vanguard, schwab or fidelity, and give them up to $5500 annually to invest for you.   you have more investment choices, target date funds plus other options.   depending on your income level and whether you have an employer 401k, you open a traditional or roth ira, with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described 401k types.  iras are your go-to option if you have no employer 401k, but you still may (and even should) want to use an ira, especially a roth ira, even if you have one.  you can  tap ira and  401k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons, though it's not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes.  a roth ira is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties.

ok.  that was a lot of information!  ready to repay student loans(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)?  let's find out:  

-  if you do have student loans, the interest rate clock is ticking.  loans are typically 10 year repayment, so you'll owe about 1% of the loan balance each month for ten years.   
if you owe $20,000, that's $200/month.  like a car payment.  not terrible.   
if you owe $100,000, that will be $1000/month.  like a mortgage payment, only without the house.  not fun to pay.  
you have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven.  you have several approaches(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans) available for repayment:

- pay them back on schedule.  it sounds crazy, but it just might work!   if your income supports it, pay the minimum on low-interest (<~4%) loans.  if you have even more income, repay them faster with extra payments, especially on higher interest loans,  and save by paying less interest than you would over time.  this is your primary option on private loans.   if you have high-interest private loans, look into refinancing(https://studentloanhero.com/refinance-and-consolidate-student-loans-0042/) them; if you have good income and credit, you'll qualify for lower interest rates.  

- if you have a lot of federal loans but  little income, look into reduced payment plans(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) like income-based repayment (ibr) and pay-as-you-earn (paye) plans.  you'll pay less (even nothing) each month, based on your current income, but you'll pay longer, and ultimately pay more over time in many cases.  

- if you are really in a deep hole, maybe over $100k federal with only $40k annual income, give a special look into public service loan forgiveness(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (pslf).  this program allows you to work for ten years in public service, make minimal payments, then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven, which is a really sweet deal if you can get it.  (this differs from forgiveness programs for ibr/paye that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future.)

enough about  student loans.  let's wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to 22 year olds:

- grad school can be a good idea, but can also be a very expensive idea.  if you are sure this is for you, try to get someone else to pay for it, whether the school via scholarships / stipends, or your employer, if they do education reimbursement.  med school is worth the money no matter who pays.   law school and mba return on investment is iffier these days.  going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake, especially so if you have to pay for it.

- you may be responsible for your health insurance(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance).  (you could be on your parents' plan until age 26 in many cases, though that may cost them something.) if your employer will pay for it, that's your best option.  they may offer a lower-premium high deductible health plan(http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan) (hdhp), where you pay routine costs, but insurance kicks in for major expenses.  this is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims.  you  should take advantage of a healthcare savings account(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/what-is-an-hsa/) (hsa) with an hdhp.  this lets you deduct contributions to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, with  other unique features that make them attractive.  you can contribute $3350 annually to your hsa.  some employers pay some of this for you as more free money.   

- if your employer doesn't offer health insurance and you can't use your parents' plan, you'll want to get an individual plan such as those found on healthcare.gov(http://healthcare.gov).  you can only sign up at certain times, including open enrollment  in november / december.  if you don't have health insurance of some form, you could pay a penalty(https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) of up to ~$2000 at tax time, unless you have an exemption(https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/).  

- with more income, you can rent a nicer place within the same 30% of takehome guideline.  you may not even want a roommate!  of course, any money you spend on housing is money you don't have for other things.  living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save, e.g. to pay down student loans.   please make sure you have renter's insurance, it's well worth the small cost.   (note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house; you may not yet be sure where you  want to live long-term, have limited work history, or have insufficient down payment.) 

- you can also afford a nicer car, since you have better credit, and  lower insurance rates.  (you don't have to upgrade your car, and you'll save money if you don't.)  paying cash is still an option, but if you qualify for a 2% car loan, consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments.  a good target price is perhaps $15k, with a $10k loan, which works out to 4 years at $220/month.  your total cost-of-car would be about $5k annually.  selling your old car privately should get you 20% more than you would by trading it in to a dealer.  

- with more expenses, budgeting becomes much more important.  you'll want to have a bigger emergency fund; we recommend at least three months' expenses, to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks.   with more expenses to track, look into a program like you need a budget(https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (ynab) or mint(https://www.mint.com/) to help keep track of where your money is, and where it needs to be in the future.  look for ways to economize where you can, whether by cheaper cell-phone plans, learning to cook so you want to eat at home, or taking advantage of employee discounts.  

- while you don't have a lot of tax deductions yet outside of retirement / hsa savings, take a look at possible tax breaks(http://blogs.hrblock.com/2013/04/08/twenty-somethings-dont-overlook-these-tax-deductions/) for student loan interest, moving expenses associated with a job change, and certain tuition expenses (american opportunity tax credit(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc)).  you don't have to itemize to take advantage of these, but income limits apply in some cases.

"paying attention to my 401k saved my company's employees ~$92,000. this is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. 

i work for a company with ~600 employees across north america. since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and i was having fun with it, so i started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.

one year i logged into my 401k provider (fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a fee for $12.50. to that date i had never seen a fee before. i called my hr/benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. they reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but i learned a lesson: 401ks (and the hr departments behind a company) were not infallible.  i added 'fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.

2 years went by, until this last year. this year in february i pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. i couldn't figure it out. finally, i went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. and there i saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in march. it was the strangest thing! it wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. it wasn't even listed under 'fees'. it was just a *negative* company match. (shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) and i knew it wasn't just those dollars i was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. 

i started asking around. my hr department said there were no reported problems and that if i wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, i could wait two weeks until i had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. i said, 'schedule it'. but i didn't stop there. i started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. i had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. the amounts all varied, but it was always on the same march date. 

by this point i got enough people riled up that i ended up talking to the head of benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. it took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. it took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. i'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but i was the only one who had bothered to check. 

i know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. and i'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. but every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. you might be surprised what you find.

"be prepared if you're resigning or quitting, have been fired, or are being laid off: a pf checklist. there's a long list of things you need to worry about when separating from your job regardless of how or why that is happening.  it is often an emotional time, but missing a few key steps could be troublesome down the road. (https://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/leaving-my-job-without-the-going-away-party--aa5a7/)

this checklist is intended to apply for most situations including: resigning or quitting a job, being fired from a job, or being laid off.  navigating the end of a contract as a contractor is not really the focus of this post, but some steps may still apply.

some specifics will only apply to the us (e.g., retirement account types, filing for unemployment, health care).  if you're aware of a guide for any other countries, please make a comment!

## before resigning *or* if you are at risk of being let go/laid off

- it hopefully goes without saying, but you should already have a firm job offer in hand before resigning (unless you have a different plan like heading back to school).  likewise, if you are at risk of being let go or laid off, you should be building your network at the very least (if not outright looking for a new position).
- do you have a retirement plan with your employer (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457, simple ira, sep ira, or tsp)?
  - note that many employers will require to to pay off any outstanding loans you have made against your retirement plan.  if that's the case, you will have only 60 days after separation to pay off the balance to avoid early distribution taxes and penalties.
  - plan out what you'll do with your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement account.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers)
  - recognize that you will be giving up any unvested matching for your retirement plan.
- have a plan for the first few months after the job.
  - figure out what you'll do for health insurance (sign up for your own via cobra or the aca, switch to a spouse's plan, or wait to get coverage with new employer).
  - consider whether you will want to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy.
  - make sure you have enough money to carry you into your next job without dipping into your emergency fund, set up a budget, and examine your general financial situation.  emergency funds are for unexpected circumstances.
  - if you are planning on moving, understand that landlords often want to see proof of a job and income - which may make getting a new place more difficult.
- make copies of any performance reviews, professional certifications, or other personal documents that you'll want to keep as well as your current vacation balance, salary information, etc. having a copy of your contract and benefit information on a personal computer is also recommended as you might not have access to them in the future.
- however, do not take copies of any work performed without written approval from management.  this is not your property and is equivalent to stealing.
- backup (commonly by emailing a copy to your personal email or copying to a thumb drive) and remove all personal files from your work computer, work phone, and any other device.
- be prepared for what you'll do or say if your manager makes a counteroffer.  many people say it's a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign, but it can also go well.
- don't give more than two weeks of notice if leaving immediately and not being paid for your remaining time would be a financial hardship.
- if you received stock options, received a hiring bonus, or receive ongoing monetary bonuses or rsus:
  - examine your vesting schedule and consider whether you may have to return any bonus money (e.g. hiring bonus, moving stipend, education assistance) before you decide when to quit.
  - don't expect to collect options, rsus, or bonuses during your notice period because you might be terminated immediately. it's better to wait to give notice until after any important vesting dates (you should still give two weeks).
  - purchase any stock options that are ""in the money"".
- check on your benefits and find out what happens to them upon leaving.
  - do you get your outstanding vacation days paid out or do you lose them (meaning you should take them before resigning if possible)?
  - when does your health/dental/vision insurance expire?  end of the month or day you leave?  make sure any appointments are scheduled with this in mind.
  - if you have floating holidays, you may want to take them before resigning.
  - if you have an fsa, is there anything left in it to spend down (check out fsa eligible items on amazon). anything left the day you leave, the company keeps. even if you are resigning on jan 15 and only contributed once, you can still spend the entire annual amount and not have to pay it back.

- put together an email list of anyone you want to email (individually or as a group) when you leave.  don't email too large of a group because it's tacky and use bcc: for group emails.
  - email should be short and to the point. something like it was great working with you, i learned a lot.  here's my personal info to keep in touch.  don't try to explain yourself.

## how to resign

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- bring a box with you (leave it in your car if you can't bring it in discreetly) to allow for easy packing of any personal possessions in case you are walked out that day.
- make sure you have contact information for any key people - coworkers, managers - that you want to keep in contact with or possible use as a reference in the future.  send a copy of this to your personal email.
- do not tell your coworkers/friends prior to telling your boss and hr.  this is not something that you want floating around the office.
- tell your manager in person and present a short and professional resignation letter to him or her at this meeting.  when you leave the meeting, email a copy to them and hr (even if it is from home later that day).
  - don't make it personal or give a reason.  state the facts.  ""i am resigning position effective date."" you don't owe them a reason (especially in written form), don't try to provide a list of things they could fix, etc.
  - if you want to elaborate with your manager in person, keep the discussion positive and brief.
- give two weeks notice and finish strong, but don't be surprised if you get walked out the day you resign or even immediately after resigning.
- if you do end up working the notice period - you still need to work!  this is what you will be remembered for, don't start slacking off. work with your manager to finish or hand off all projects you are currently working.
- once you do leave, if something was left behind, make arrangements to pick it up. talk to hr about this if needed.
- send any goodbye email later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people).

## what to do after you are laid off or fired

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- try to keep a calm appearance until you are off property.  this is an emotional time, but you don't want to be remembered as the person who cussed out everyone as they were dragged out by security.
- make sure you have contact information for both your manager and hr representative in case of questions later.
- try your best to pack any essential personal possessions that day if you get walked out, check for small things like cell phone chargers and pictures. it can be awkward returning later.
  - if you do need to return for personal items or any other reason, make arrangements in advance, don't just show up and expect to be let back in.
- you may be asked to sign a legal document giving up certain rights (e.g., a non-compete clause or waiving certain rights to sue) in exchange for severance pay and/or other benefits.  note that non-compete clauses are very difficult to enforce in some states.  you absolutely need to read the entire document before signing and it's your decision to make.  consult an attorney if you need help.
- send any goodbye emails later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people). do not send anything right away because your emotions will be running high.

## after leaving

- if you were laid off or fired, apply for unemployment(https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-file-for-unemployment-benefits-online-2064123) as soon as you can assuming you were not fired for misconduct (i.e., terminated for cause)(https://www.thebalance.com/can-i-collect-unemployment-if-i-am-fired-2064150). the entire process can take weeks so do this as soon as possible.
- any life insurance coverage through your employer will terminate after you leave (sometimes immediately, sometimes at the end of the month).  consider converting your group life insurance policy to an individual policy, especially if others depend on your income or if you have medical conditions that may prevent you from getting an individual policy on your own. the cost tends to be low, but you will only have a limited amount of time to do this (usually 30 days or until the end of the current month, but don't count on that).
- move your 401(k) or other employee-sponsored retirement account to your new plan or a rollover ira (if that was your plan).
- get on linkedin and link up with the ex-coworkers who would say good things about you (and vice versa).
- get health insurance if needed (see above).  there's a 60-day grace period after leaving your job for cobra election (you can get coverage retroactively), but signing up for aca coverage may be less expensive.
- make sure you have a plan for how you will sell any company stock.
- inform your new employer about how much you've already contributed to your 401(k) for this calendar year to avoid exceeding the contribution limit.  note that you may have another paycheck or two still coming from your old employer after you quit so it may take a little time to figure this number out.

## being unemployed

unless you have a signed job offer in hand, it's time to actually *act* like you are unemployed.

- hoard cash.  don't waste money on stuff you don't need to survive.  review your budget, cut any and all unnecessary expenses, stop eating out and going out to bars for drinks.
- you have extra time so use it to save money: cook at home, exercise on the cheap, read books from libraries instead of buying them.
- your ""job"" is now finding a new job.  
  - update your resume (get some feedback on /r/resumes), customize it to each job, and submit it everywhere.  
  - spend time every day on job search sites, linkedin, and communicating with your network.  set a weekly goal to send customized applications and resumes to a specific number of jobs per week (e.g., 20 jobs).

"we decided not to buy a bearded dragon.. my wife and i were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday. a young beardie is only about $60. so we set aside $200 in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals. 

then we learned it needs expensive uv bulbs that last about 6 months and are about $40 each. also the electricity cost the run this heat 24 hours can be a drain on the electric bill. 

also the beardie needs to go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup. and finally, food. they have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods. so i did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives 12 years and it turned out to be a whopping $10,000 

life pro tip, do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase. even free pets are absurdly expensive. in 12 years both of my kids are going to be in college and i will desperately need $10,000 then. i will not need an aging lizard.

edit: for everyone giving me shit about my poor son, don't pity him. first he didn't know about the beardie. second we are taking that $200 and taking him to an amusement park. he's fine. 

edit 2: this post is not about ""don't buy pets, they're expensive."" the post is about ""make sure you're aware of the full cost of something before making a decision."" yes we have kids and dogs. yes they're more expensive than lizards, but for us well worth the cost. a reptile, not so much. 

edit 3: thank you all for the ""you're way overestimating"" and the ""you're way underestimating"" posts. the accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. the issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake. the point is, we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay. to us, it wasn't worth it. we have other pets. we aren't frugal, but we are smart with our money. i am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis. and at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth 10k to you, awesome! do it.

"i have to move out at 18, what do i do?. i won't bring up the specific details, but long story short, my parents are legitimately crazy, one of those extreme situations where everything i do must be kept secret (talking to friends, working a normal job, etc).

luckily in the middle of last year i got a job with my brother, he told my parents he would not pay me, then paid me in secret. since then i have about 10k saved up, but recently they have made it very difficult to even work because i am assuming they somehow figured out i am being paid. because of this, i will likely lose my job and my income, however, i do have experience working with people, writing resumes, doing interviews, so i don't think getting another job will be super difficult. the main issue for me is how can i get out of this house as quickly as possible? for a while i thought that maybe these things my parents do were normal, but the more i am exposed to the real world (mostly through the internet, which i had very little access to until about 2 years ago) i found out these things are in fact extreme and unusual.

for a bit more context, i am 17, no car, no license (parents won't let me get one), no friends who would be willing to let me live with them (socializing was very hard because i was homeschooled) i have a associate's degree and as i said, 10k saved up. whats my best course of action to get away?

"180 days later, bank of america is refusing to refund over $700 in fraudulent charges made in texas while we were 800 miles away in illinois.. back in july we were wrapping up our yearly road trip to illinois. we purchased gas around 8 or 9am right before we started the 12 hour trip to texas.

&#x200b;

two hours into the trip my wife gets a notification on her phone from bank of america alerting her to fruadulent charges being made. we only have one debit cad.

&#x200b;

while we were starting our driving home, someone in austin, tx purchased around $500 in merch at home depot, drove towards houston, tx attempting twice to use our card at the atm, which did not work because they didnt have the pin. they made their $200-ish last transaction at tj maxx north of houston before were alerted and had the card shut off. (austin to houston is about a 3 hour car ride)

my wife immedately makes a claim. 10 days later, we get the money credited back while they continue the investigation which seems pretty open and shut to me... they also say it may be another 45 days before they finish their investigation.

october 5, they send a letter stating that they have completed their investigation: ""our records show the transaction activity in question was authorized for and posted to your account."" the letter states they'll be taking the $740 back on october 22.

wife calls and has them reopen the case or escalate it. we're told it could be another 45 days.

jan 3. wife calls them again. this agent states that while an escalation sends an email to their investigators notifying that we are still asking about they case, they are under no obligation to complete it.

&#x200b;

after reading a bit into the law surrounding this, we have realized we can request the documentation they used to close the investigation.

&#x200b;

what else can we do? do we need a lawyer? if they had to reimburse us for the first 45 days of the investigation, why do they not have to temporarily reimburse us as they continue to investigate ""for as long as they need"" with no date set for resolution on our end?

&#x200b;

it is blatantly obvious that someone skimmed the card at some point and had a dummy one made. are they able to continue to withhold our $750 indefinitely and just keep saying. ""nope! looks good!"" until we tire out?

&#x200b;

our kiddos missed out on a lot of christmas gifts because of this and now bills are starting to get a bit tight. we really need this money back. thanks yall!

**update:** started posting on social media before i start filing complaints. 20 minutes later bank of america contacted me on twitter. will update later. thanks for everyone's advice.

**update 2: 3 hours later...** i continued to post on social media, reaching out to local news stations on twitter that have community protection or investigative segments and linking to this post. bank of america has now reached out in one of these posts, referencing my wifes name. fingers crossed.  http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0(http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0)

**update 3:** wife got home 30 min after my last update. a rep with boa actually called her asking what was going on. the rep said she would need to call the fraud department and get them all on the line together. we are at our kids practice so opted for them to call us when they have someone on the line who can help us. will update later.

**update 4:** just got off the phone with someone in the fraud department at bank of america. i recorded the whole convo and will be uploading it to youtube. she says the call on oct 22 did in fact reopen the case. (even though the rep on dec 22 said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want)

they now have 60 business days from oct 22 to finish the claim once again.

she says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account. (they hit up two atms and failed to use the pin to drain the account, so they don't even have the correct info to base their findings off)

i requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says i should get that in 10 business days. they now have until jan 18 to notify us of their findings. i'm going to continue with filing reports and posting on social media.

i'll update in a few weeks i guess.

**update 5: 10 hours later,** they have blocked me on facebook for sharing my problems on their page. i also filed a complaint with the cfpb .

**update 6:** 24 hours since this post and david, a bank of america employee in the ""regulatory complaints department"" left my wife a voice mail  in regards to a complaint sent to them by the cfpb. they close at 4pm est. (they're closed by the time we got the voice mail since she is at work). will update monday.

**update 7:** wife woke up this morning and the money has been returned to our account. time to turn and burn!

thank you everyone for your advice. we learned a lot from this.

**update 8: we got confirmation that the fraud claim is now closed and the money that was returned is permanent. waiting on an actual paper letter to come in the mail before we turn and run. thanks everyone! update here:** **https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/adnjj7/update\_bank\_of\_america\_refusing\_to\_return\_700\_in/**(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/adnjj7/update_bank_of_america_refusing_to_return_700_in/)",11
"successfully negotiated a 45% raise in salary, thanks pf!. i recently decided i wanted to move on from my job for a variety of reasons. one of the main reasons was i felt i was undervalued. so with a lot of research here is how i went from $58,000 to $85,000.

1. i felt i was undervalued, so i needed to prove it. 
2. i needed another job, obviously.
3. i needed to know how to negotiate.
4. i needed to make sure i knew my bottom line and what i really wanted.
5. making the decision.

so lets start with number 1. **am i undervalued?**

i needed to research how much my job title was worth. for this i went to the bureau of labor statistics, salary.com, glassdoor.com, and google.  http://www.bls.gov/ooh/ has nearly ever piece of info you need to decide what your position is worth.  salary.com and glassdoor.com also where close to bls.  don't settle on one source for anything. 

do realize when doing this part that you need to take into consideration the local job market in your area.  where i live for example, i know my area pays less than the median because my cost of living is alot lower than most other places.  so when you decide what the median pay is for what you do, be realistic. for me the median pay was $70,000.  my current job was paying me $58,000.  so number one was finished, i am being undervalued.

on to number 2. **find another job**

i needed to find other places of employment in my area, doing what i wanted to do.  for this i went to the google, as it has all the answers.  i made profiles on careerbuilder, indeed, glassdoor, and monster.  i updated my resume, and started applying for everything i thought i would want to do.  

it is important to realize when applying for jobs it is time consuming and will get frustrating repeating your self over and over.  but you need to stay diligent. also it is worth your time to tweak your resume to match key words in the application you are applying for.  

i wish i would have known the importance of networking as well.  sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person.  never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you.

anyway, i applied for a week straight. then slowly the calls and emails started rolling in. hell yes!

by the end of the week i had 3 interviews setup. i was amazed on just how easy it could be to get the process started.  then the hard part came. interviewing.

my interviews went awesome.  i researched what to say and how to say it, how to accent my strengths, and all that jazz. the best piece of advice on how to interview well is read! google is your best friend.  for me the best things were my drive to succeed and my willingness to learn.  many employers will pick people who are driven over people with alot of experience.  obviously you need to have some skills, but don't underestimate the power of persistence.

employer a gave me a range for the job pretty easily when i asked about it.  this makes your negotiating power much higher as most of you know. but the range was way to low.  i knew already this place was out.  but i thanked them for the interview anyway. sometimes you just are to far apart to waste each others time any further.  be polite though if this happens and move on.

employer b wanted to know how much i wanted for a salary.  i thought ""oh yea i know not to say anything, i am so clever!""  well they didn't budge.  the wouldn't give me a range, and they kept at me.  sometimes this will happen.  handle it accordingly.  i gave them a high range 75k-85k.  they seemed ok with it.

employer c was the same way as employer b. i handled it the same.

number 3. **negotiation**

so i received 3 offers in 2 weeks.  wait, you got offers at all 3 places? hell yes i did! one offer was lower than i wanted, so employer a was out. be sure to thank everyone for there time and offers.  remember... don't burn bridges.

but the other 2 offers where above the median income i researched!  this further made me realize i'm definitely worth more than i'm making now. employer b was at $82,000. employer c was at $75,000.  it was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers.  this validated my thoughts and research of being undervalued even further.

there is a myriad of things to negotiate. don't just think about salary, but the overall package. this article helped me alot when preparing.  http://www.careerempowering.com/interview-power/negotiating-the-best-salary.html  don't be afraid to tell people what you want.  but don't go overboard.  no one is going to pay you 1,000,000 a year to clean toilets.

now that i have these offers i can leverage one against the other.  this works the best when you know a company really wants you. i spoke with both companies back and forth and i knew employer b was the winner. damn this is crazy! 58k to 82k in 2 weeks. 

i go to my current boss and tell him whats happening.  i was upfront and honest about everything, that's usually the best way to go. then my current employer decides to counter offer. $85,000.  what the hell do i do now? my brain is on overload.

through much reading and researching i found that counter offers are generally a bad idea to accept.  i mean i wanted to leave anyway, that hasn't changed.  so i took the counter offer and spoke with the other employer b about it.  they decide to match the salary and i negotiate more days off.  is this really happening? 85k

number 4. **knowing what you really want, and what you bottom line is**

the offer of $85,000 was above and beyond my bottom line.  the overall package of benefits matched my expectations.  the job is what i wanted to do.  you need to know this stuff going in and be able to walk away when someone does meet your bottom line. staying strong and not budging on this bottom line is essential.  

finally 5. **making the decision**

the hardest part of all this stuff is making an actual decision. i'm going from $58,000 to $85,000 in either decision i make. i'm on the winning side either way.  try and take your emotions out of it, and look at the facts.  for me i decided to take the new opportunity and take the plunge into the unknown.  do not second guess yourself. 

i realize my situation may not be average.  getting a 45% raise probably isn't typical. but the fact remains that it is possible to negotiate a better lifestyle. it is nerve racking, intense, anxiety inducing, and difficult.  but it is all worth it in the end. i hope this helps at least one person in their pursuit of a better life.  thanks pf for all the help and courage to tackle the unknown.",11
"bank of america is refusing to give back $9,800 to my dad's account after someone fraudulently stole his funds.. on the night of november 1st/early morning of november 2nd, someone made 8 separate withdrawals of $600 each(total $4800) at atm machines in tarrytown, white plains, and lower manhattan from my dad's account and then phone transferred another $5000 from his savings account to his checking account. then the thief made three purchases at target with a debit card, charging $1000, $2000, and $2000 respectively. the total amount that was taken out of my father's account was $9,800.

when he checked his email on november 4th, my father immediately called bank of america and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims (one for the saving and one for the checking accounts).

after waiting several business days for the result of the investigation, my father called bofa to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system! they reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later.
i don't understand how the bank can deny responsibility. my dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit card(not even members of his own family). when you put money in a bank, it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him, but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault.

he was informed by a bofa associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on oct. 27, 2016, but he did not make a call to bofa on that date. i don't understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through, or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts! also, how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted? he did not make the call to request a new debit card! where are the security checks in place for any of this?
my father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash. they said that as long as the fraud is reported within 60 days, the bank has an obligation to return the funds.

the last time he spoke with a bofa manager in a local branch, they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time.

but this is the letter that my father received from bofa today:

we've completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings, we're unable to honor the claim
because the transfer was made to an account that you own and the funds were made available to you for personal use, used to
pay an obligation owed by you, or both. as a result, we're respectfully denying your claim.

have additional information pertaining to the transaction(s), please contact us at the toll-free number listed below.
• you may request copies of the documents used in our investigation and we'll mail the information to you for your records.

fraud and claims


at this point, what should he be doing? contacting the local news? getting a lawyer and suing bofa? i asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to bofa so that there is a paper trail of all of this.

according to the ftc, he should be fully covered.
https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/…/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-a…


edit:  thank you all for your replies and comments.  i will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and i will keep everyone updated on any additional details.  in the meantime, i will try to answer some of the questions that were posed:

1) the thief called bofa and requested a new atm/debit card on october 27th and it was mailed to my parent's home address.  i believe that whoever called bofa to request the card also stole it from the mail.  my mom's account at bofa was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances, so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts (their accounts are not linked) after the incident. 
bofa mailed my dad's debit/atm card and pin on separate days as requested, but my mom's new debit/atm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day.  i am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the card/pin.  

2) a lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high.  my dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to $2400.  apparently, the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit.  they then made 4x$600 withdrawals right before midnight on november 1st, and 4x$600 withdrawals in the early morning of november 2nd.  by the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased, his money was already long gone.

3) i have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining 5k from the savings account to the checking account.  i would think that you could do a transfer right at the atm. i think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and bofa frankly does not care to look into them.  they also don't care to look at the videos from the atms.  

edit#2: update
great news!  bank of america has returned the money to my dad's bank account.  he received an email to log into his bofa account to check some new messages.  after he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.

the next step is to find out from bofa and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from bofa to be mailed to my dad's address.  i saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did!  i realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but i did mention that he filed a police report. it's just buried in that text.  a lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible.  my mom and dad immigrated to the us over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas.  i'm their only child and i live on the west coast while they still live in ny.  i also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol.  they don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. in any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place. hopefully bofa will be able to provide us more information in that regards.",11
"saying: ""i don't want to save, i want to live life and have fun while i'm young"" is just an excuse that makes you feel better about your bad spending habits.. i see this over and over in my family and friends and ironically in r/personalfinance. "" i want to live my life, not save every penny"", that sort of thing. 

**it is possible to save while still doings fun things, eating nice meals and traveling.** when someone makes it a this-or-that situation i think they are making excuses for poor spending habits or budgeting. sometimes deferring gratification leads to the ability to have more fun and freedom once you've established yourself financially. i'm not talking about waiting till retirement btw, im talking about getting a budget setup, getting some investments going, getting some interest coming in, paying off debt that costs you interest etc. interest is money you could be using for fun, that you instead are paying to some huge corporation. what i'm describing isn't some kind of punishment, it's a way to be more intentional and to always make sure the things you are spending on are helping you attain your goals and add lasting fulfillment to your life. it's the ability to buy things at their actual cost because you can get a decent interest rate. 

i don't make insane amounts of money, but i'm careful and try not to buy things i don't need. i always ask how many times a year i will use something before buying it. i think about how small amounts add up to be a big amount over time. my family mocks me saying things like "" he still has his first $1."" basically saying i'm cheap. they all buy whatever they want when they want it. they are in debt, stuck in life and unfulfilled by the very items keeping them there. once you get on the roller coaster of spending on credit cards for instant gratification, it can be very hard to get off.

i'm not saying this in a judgemental way, i've just seen so many people i care about struggle financially because of this mindset. i've seen it limit their ability to see the world and follow their dreams. seeing it being perpetuated in a place designed to help people get their shit together is kind of brutal to watch. 

if you are a young person coming here for advice, this is the best advice i can give: briefly defer your gratification. half the time the thing you ""must have"" seems pointless if you just sit on it for a week. avoid impulses and focus on experiences and items that will last and wear well over time. once you have established a solid financial foundation, your ability to go places and do things will quickly outpace the friends and family around you that are focused on attaining every minor impulse and paying off the associated debts.



**tl:dr you can be financially together and still have a fun!**

well, this is a stark reminder that pensions are not bulletproof.  yes, all investing is some form of gambling, but with 401ks and iras it's at least your money, which you control and can withdraw as needed.  i am *not* saying that pensions are inherently bad and that no one should ever use one.  they are a great cushion to your other assets.  but please, please, please: do not skip other forms of investing because you think you're going to be set for life in retirement thanks to a company pension plan.",11

this was my whole letter.
i was told it was unprofessional by his assistant and that i should have called my boss to talk to him about leaving before submitting a formal notice so he knew why and what my plans are.
my mother works in the same company and she was contacted before me by the assistant to see what my plans are and why i want to quit. (i'm in my mid 20s living on the other side of the country as her and we talk sparsely, there's no precedent for her being questioned in my mind.) i was told he'd be contacting me soon, i gave up trying to contact him because he never responds.

i sent this late last month and i haven't heard anything from him whatsoever.

my new job is giving me a sign on bonus and doubling my annual salary so there's no chance i will be staying here at all. i want to know what you guys think and if there's something i should do that i may not know to do. thanks.


edit: 
- role, not roll. i goofed.
- i didn't actually use my reddit name in this letter 
- i work in a high specialty field in a high position. they won't be able to hire someone off the street, thus the reason for the long notice.
- boss was not contacted before hand because he has not responded to me for over a month prior. weeks-months at a time without response before that.

"things i wish i'd done in my 20's. i was thinking this morning about habits i developed a bit later than i should have, even when i knew i should have been doing them. these are a few things i thought i'd share and interested if others who are out of their 20s now have anything additional to add.

edit 1: this is not a everyone must follow this list, but rather one philosophy and how i look back on things.

edit 2: i had no idea this musing would blow up like this. i'm at work now but will do my best to respond to all the questions/comments i can later today. 


1. take full advantage of 401k match. when i first started my career i didn't always do this. i wasn't making a lot of money and prioritized fun over free money. honestly i could have had just as much fun and made some better financial choices elsewhere, like not leasing a car.
2. invest in a roth ira. once i did start putting money into a 401k i was often going past the match amount and not funding a roth instead. if i could go back that's what i'd do. i'm not in a place where i max out my 401k and my with and i both max out roth iras.
3. don't get new cars. i was originally going to say don't lease as that's what i did but a better rule is no new cars. one exception here is if you are fully funding your retirement and just make a boatload of money and choose to treat yourself in this way go for it. i still think it's better to get a 2 year old car than a new one even then but i'll try not to get too preachy.
4. buy cars you can afford with cash. i've decided that for me i now buy cars cash and don't finance them, but i understand why some people prefer to take out very low interest loans on cars. if you are going to take a loan make sure you have the full amount in cash and invest it at a higher rate of return, if it's just sitting in a bank account you are losing money. we've been conditioned for years that we all deserve shiny new things. we don't deserve them these are wants not needs.



those are my big ones. i was good with a lot of other stuff. i've never carried a balance on a credit card. i always paid my bills on time. i had an emergency fund saved up quite early in my career. the items above are where i look back and see easy room for improvement that now at 37 would have paid off quite well for me with little to no real impact on my lifestyle back then aside from driving around less fancy cars.",11
"negotiated a 17k raise after ~ 2 1/2 years of stagnation. feels great!. in july of 2014 i accepted a healthcare it position for a well known hospital. at the time, i had only 2 years of experience in the field and was fairly green. since then i have learned an overwhelming amount through my various assigned projects and my skillset has improved dramatically. after lurking in this sub for several months, i became increasingly agitated by my employer's inability to revisit my initial salary, which i know was considerably lower than my coworkers. coming to the conclusion that my salary would never increase without action from myself, i summoned the courage to talk to my boss. i demonstrated clear examples of how well i had adapted to the unique challenges of the job. it didn't take very long before he stopped me and said ""you don't have to say anymore. your work has been tremendous lately and we need to reappraise your salary."" 

unfortunately it took five gruelingly long months to get the last bit of approval needed through the awful bureaucracy that is my employer's hr, but i just received the news yesterday that it had been fully approved. effective in 3 weeks, i'll be making $82,000 from $65,000, and staying with the same employer.  i can't wait to up the percentage on my 401(k) and start putting more away each month. i'm still buzzing, and i'll always be a loyal follower of this sub!

"surprise $2,700 medical bill from a ""surgical assistant"" i didn't even know was at my surgery.. so about 3 weeks ago i had a hernia repair done. after meeting with the surgeon, speaking with the scheduler and my insurance, i was told that my surgery was going to be completely paid for by the insurance, as i had already met my deductible and my company's insurance is pretty good.

a couple of weeks after the surgery, everything got billed out and just like i was told, i owed nothing. however, a couple of days ago i saw that a new claim popped up and that i owed $2,702 for a service i didn't know what it was. i checked my mail and there was a letter from american surgical professionals saying that it was determined that surgical assistant services were necessary to the procedure. the letter also said that as a ""courtesy"" to me they bill my insurance carrier first, and surprise, they said they weren't paying, so i have to incur all costs. i was never aware of any of this, nobody told me this could happen and i was completely out and had 0 control over what was going on during my surgery. 

why is this a thing? isn't this completely illegal? is there any way i can fight this? i appreciate any help.

edit: forgot to mention, the surgery was done at an in-network hospital with an in-network surgeon.

edit2: since i've seen many people asking, this happened in texas.

edit4: i want to thank everyone who has commented on this thread with very helpful information. next week, i will get in touch with my insurance and i will call the hospital and the surgeon as well. i will also send letters to all three parties concerned and will fight this as hard as i can. i will post an update once everything gets resolved. whichever way it gets resolved...

i did this not only to ensure i was getting my maximum refund, but to also see which was the superior service, as i had seen all 3 recommended frequently throughout the sub.  as someone who is completely new to filing their own taxes, freetaxusa was by far the most enjoyable all around experience (as enjoyable as doing your taxes can be, at least.) i would recommend to anyone here that plans to file their taxes themselves to use their service. and yes, i realize everyone's tax situation is different so the ""best"" service is slightly subjective. this was just my experience! 

 it was far and away the cheapest option for my situation, as it actually honored the free filing option for federal and only cost $12.95 for state filing (10% discount if you enter freetaxusa10 in the promo code section at the the end). h&r and turbotax both shot up to between $80-$100 total cost to file my federal and state returns once i entered in my 1098e, 1099-misc, 1099-int and div etc. they also hounded me to upgrade to an even more expensive service throughout literally the entire process. 

freetaxusa walked me through the process very efficiently and painlessly. they went through every possible type of income, credit and deduction i could have.  and most importantly (for me at least), they were true to their word of being a free service. they didn't steadily increase the price as i entered more information and they didn't try to get me to buy additional products and services i didn't need. hope this helps anyone else out there new to the process, without a doubt will be using them again next year! 

edit: someone asked if there was a difference in the amount of my refund (should've included that in the original post, sorry!). but, for federal, no. they all came out exactly the same. for state, yes. freetaxusa found an additional $33 on my state refund that h&r and turbotax did not find. 

edit 2: as mentioned by another user, if you go through ebates you can get an additional 25% off the state fee and it should be stackable with the 10% off promo code. however, i did not try this personally. was unaware at the time!  and some states give the option to file for free through the state. i did not find where my state offers this service, however. 

edit 3: i have seen a few people say they were able to get the free service through turbotax and my post may be a little unintentionally misleading in that regard. yes, i did go through the free file portal with turbotax like i did with the other services. however, once i began entering my income information, that is when i was disqualified from the free service and i was automatically placed into a paid service. turbotax does offer free filing, but only if you make less than 34k a year or are a military member that makes less than 66k a year, and i'm neither! sorry if i mislead anyone! 

also, it makes a difference in price with h&r and turbotax if you have a 1098e/1098t, self employment/contract labor income, savings account interest, an hsa, investment income etc., and freetaxusa doesn't charge for entering these forms. some of these things do apply to my 2018 tax situation, which is likely a major reason it was so much more expensive to file with  h&r and turbotax. as i said in the post, everyone's tax situation is slightly different and i'm not trying to promote certain products over others! just wanted to provide my personal experience! 

final edit (hopefully): a lot of people are under the assumption that you have to wait until the 28th to file, but that is not the case. if you have all of your documents you can file earlier. the irs may even accept your return early to use while they test out their system. i completed mine yesterday and actually got an email from freetaxusa a few minutes ago stating that my refund had been accepted by the irs and i would be getting my refund within 21 days. 

much requested tl:dr: for my tax situation, which included several sources of income, i would recommend freetaxusa. the interface is very user friendly, the cost of my service remained free and did not increase as i entered more information, i was not pestered to upgrade into a more expensive service throughout the process and i was able to get an additional discount on my state filing cost. 
 

*there are a few people that have said this is some sort of ad.*

*full disclaimer: i have no affiliation with any of these websites and this is not an ad. i'm just a frequent redditor trying to help out other fellow redditors! i work for state government, but based off how many people think this is an ad- maybe my future is in marketing! lol. may also have to do with the ""scammy"" name of the company... i have to admit, i was a little skeptical when i first saw it!*",11
"i found ~$5k in savings making totally non-life altering changes. i've been wanting to write this for a while. a while back i hated my job. i was working 80 hour weeks and getting paid doo-doo for the effort. in response i wrote up an ""escape plan"". it included a bunch of ways for me to replace my income, but it also included a ton of ways to save money without changing the quality of my life. 

i spent hours and hours making this thing, so that i'd have a plan to follow. good news, i got out of that hell hole, more good news, the money-saving piece is relevant to almost everyone so i figured i'd share all the ways i found that can help you save a crap ton of money without really having to change your life. 

so without further adieu. 
     

* **change your car insurance:** car insurance companies make most of their money on old clients. once you get past a certain age, they creep your rates up ever so slowly. they are willing to discount your insurance when you switch.

so we shopped around, found the lowest quote and saved a crap ton on the discount they were giving us. this was an easy one-time change that affects my life 0. 

**before:** $196/month 
**after:** $116/month
**annual savings:** $960

     
      
* **threaten your internet provider:** every internet provider offers promotional rates for your first year, then hike your bill after your first year. i've never had a problem giving someone a call and telling them that i want to move to another service because they are offering a promotion. every time they offer me their promotional rate. this is a once a year phone call that saves you a decent chunk of change. 

**before:**$69.00(lol)
**after:** $45.00
**annual savings:** $288

this won't work if there is only one provider servicing your area. sorry comcast slaves. 

     

* **switch your phone plan to mint mobile, or red pocket.** these are services that piggyback off of major mobile phone network providers at stupid discounts. 2 lines on mint is something like $15 a month. it's stupid how cheap these lines can be. their service is quite good as well.

**before:** $180/month 
**after:** $30/month
**total annual savings:** $1800
     

* **use a few credit cards like a debit card:**. if you're in the middle of crawling out of cc debt this is particularly bad advice. but if you are basically debt free, and can responsibly use your credit card like a debit card; paying it off as you go, you can save a bunch of money. basically, every expense besides my mortgage goes through a credit card so i can reap those sweet sweet rewards. 

between 3 cards i get rewards that include:

5% on gas

3% on dining out

2% on grocery stores and costco

1.5% on everything else. 

essentially these are discounts on everything. 

**before:** $0
**after:** +$30/month
**annual savings:** $720
  

these savings are based on expenses between my fiance and me.
     

* **oil change coupons:** i refuse to be a coupon lady. partly because of my y chromosome, but also because the time it takes to effectively coupon is not worth it to me. i'd rather do anything else. but oil change coupons are very easy. you have to get your oil changed at least once a quarter, and googling a coupon for it works 100% of the time. you should never pay full price for an oil change. 
  
i'm sure some of you are also saying *but foofy, you could save more by changing your own oil*. to that i say *sure, but i don't want to change anything in my life and the hourly savings is like $5. printing a coupon is easier*

**before:** $70/quarter
**after**: $50/quarter
**annual savings:** $80

not a lot, but seriously this one is so easy. 

     
* **buy a smart thermostat:** i wasted a ton of money by heating an entire house for the sake of my pets. they are going to sleep in a sunbeam no matter the temperature so there's lots of savings to be had here. you could just remember to turn down the heat/air everytime you leave the house, but that would require me to change way too much about my habbits. instead, a smart thermostat. hard to give you the ""before"" on this one but here we go:


**before:** ??
**monthly savings:** $13.5/month
**annual savings:** $135

      
* **utilize an hsa**. for those that don't know an hsa is a ""health spending account"". the way it works is you put money into it directly from your bank account, and all of that money is tax free. it's basically a free 25% money back on health expenses depending on your tax bracket. i grow moles like it's my job, and in order to avoid dying of skin cancer i have to get them removed constantly, this tacks up my health bill may be a little higher than most but still, here's the savings i had, yours will likely be more or less: 

i can hear it now, ""but my employer doesn't offer an hsa"", you can actually contribute to an hsa without your employer(https://20somethingfinance.com/contribute-to-hsa-outside-of-employer-payroll-deduction/)


**before:** $2000
**after:** $1500
**annual savings:** $500

here's an hsa savings calculator(https://www.wageworks.com/employees/support-center/hsa-savings-calculator/) if you want to figure out what you can/should contribute.

        

* **cancel your unusedgym membership:** if you don't have one, well then you can't do this one. if you have one and you consistently use it, well then don't cancel it. that said, gyms expect only 18% of people to consistently use thier facilities(https://www.creditdonkey.com/gym-membership-statistics.html) so there's a good chance that many of you (like myself) can cancel their membership without affecting their life. the 3x a year you convince yourself you're going to get in shape you can just go run outside instead. 

**before:** $20
**after:** $0
**annual savings:** $240

        
alright, that's all the easy stuff you can do without changing your life. **the grand total for us came out to $4,723.** just shy of the $5k i promised. to be fair i did put a ""~"" in front of it. 

       
not everyone one of these is going to be applicable to every person but i hope you were able to find a few nuggets in here that could save you some money. 





edit: someone noted my wonky math that cc rewards didn't add up. i forgot to double the amount with my fiance which doesn't perfectly work but is not far off. keep in mind that $1500 in expenses each going through only our 1.5% cc would yield $22.5 each. not including all the optimizing we can do. she has 3% on online shopping too so $60/month between the two of us in rewards is not that far out of the realm of possibility.

"i'm a 20f college student who just got guardianship of my 12 year old sibling. help!. long story short: my mother is a raging alcoholic and after cps and law enforcement being involved (and the father being out of the picture), i'm now the guardian of my younger sister.

i have no idea what to do.

i work full-time in a food service job making $10 per hour not including tips, which brings it to around $11-$14 per hour depending on the day.

i bring home between $1,700 and $2,000 per month. (depending on tips)

i just signed a lease for a 2br apartment at $900 per month. it is literally the cheapest option i could find that was in a safe area and not too far of a commute to work (around 11 miles).

my current expenses are: $160 for a personal loan, $40 for cell phone, $180 for car insurance, $80 credit card. per month. 

i honestly don't know what to do. her child support is coming to me now, so that gives me an extra $400 per month.

she doesn't have health insurance and hasn't been in school for almost a year now. since i am her guardian can i add him to my own health insurance as a dependent?

i figured posting here would be most helpful because as a college student i have no idea how to budget for a child. tuition isn't an issue because it's fully covered by grants.

how do i plan this? what are my options? i don't even know where to start...

edit: also there are no other adults to help. i am the oldest sibling and my father is also out of the picture. no aunts/uncles/etc. my grandma lives on the other side of the country but is sending a little bit of money to help but nothing else more than that..",11
"how to get a live person at the irs (pretty easy). i'm an accountant and i pass this on to all my customers about how to get someone live on the phone at the irs:

call 1-800-829-1040

press 1 to confirm english if you speak english.

when you get past choosing a language, in the first menu of prompts, press 2.

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 1. 

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 3. 

when it gets to the next menu with prompts, press 2. 

the next menu will ask you to enter your ssn, it will then ask you to confirm you entered a ssn, then it will read back the number and ask you to confirm that it is the right number. 

after this, it will take you to a menu with a bunch more options. ignore them all, let the computer talk itself out and when you don't enter any more numbers, you'll be entered in a hold line for a live person! i recommend calling on wednesdays or thursdays as they seem to be the least busy, and don't call around lunch time.

mainly made this post after seeing a post with a lot of comments from people having trouble reaching the irs and a live person. hope this helps!

edit: if you want to check that the number is real, you can check at irs.gov",11
"i bought a used car last night, and if you're new to buying used, please read this so you don't fall into the traps.. i love the car buying process. it's fun, i take my time, test drive cars, find what i like and try to find a good deal on a 2-4 year old car. 

car salesmen are not the ones you need to fear. many of them are great, and work long hard honest hours to push some cars. as my dad told me before he dropped me off to buy my first used car, ""when they get you in the back room, that's when they're going to try to screw you.""

if you think that's a joke or an understatement, please accept the fact that it is neither. when you sit down in the chair in the finance office, you need to be as alert as a deer in hunting season. here's how they tried to get me, and i hope i can help one person not get taken. 

-when i sat down, the finance manager had already opted in on my behalf for every single add-on available. i mean, all of them. they do this every time, and all they need is one final signature, not individually to keep them on. it had an extended warranty, gap coverage, alarm system, electronics warranty, and a couple others i'll never remember. it was 10:30 at night when i finally got out of there and was exhausted. 

two things to know:
1) you are not obligated to any of them, no matter what they say. when i had crappy credit, i was almost convinced when they told me the finance company required gap insurance. don't believe the nonsense. 

2)apparently, after my experience last night, they are not required by any means to explain to you what you're buying. unless the finance manager i used broke several laws, after an hour of him explaining ""every detail"" there was still an extended warranty for a whopping $3,000 that he barely even alluded to! when i finally said, ""what's this warranty you keep saying is included?"" i knew the car was under manufacturer's warranty for a short time still, i thought he was talking about that. nope. i literally had to ask specifically, ""what am i paying for that?"" without me asking that very specific question, he had no intention of mentioning the price. the car still had 13k miles on the warranty, and they wanted to sell me a new one...

-you do not have to buy the $1,000-$1,500 alarm system/insurance plan they will almost cry rather than remove. this was the longest part of the process as i waited twenty minutes while they fought me the entire way, using every trick in the book. don't buy it, don't let them win. finally, they left it on and didn't charge me.

**with all that being said. there are some that you can drastically change the price of and get a good value on something that matters. they offered a dent/scratch repair on the body and wheels for five years for $895. i spent over $1,000 over the last four years on my last car from my car being hit while parked at work, so i offered them $300 and they took it. it's something i know with no deductible i can get great value out of. 

what's difference? the difference between the number i walked in that room to and the one i left with was $150 a month... (edit: meaning, i left with $150 lower monthly payment after stripping everything to the bone)

agree or disagree with anyone of this, but if i can help one person not get taken, this twenty minutes was worth it. 

good luck out there!

"i have worked at my current job less than a year, but i just recieved another offer for $13k greater salary and better benefits. i currently make $52k, and got a job offer for $65k for a ""senior"" role in my field. the benefits are all better too, with a much better 401k match. i've only worked at my current position for 10 months though, so i'm not sure leaving so soon would be a good thing. is it bad to jump jobs so frequently? would it look bad on my resume?

"i raised my credit score from 546 to 720 in 4 months thanks to you guys.. hello everyone, first let me say thank you. it is thanks to you that i finally, for the first time in my life, have control of my finances and can breath easier. i wanted to share my story in the hopes that someone else who was in a similar situation as me, might benefit from my experience. i will briefly describe how i raised my transunion and equifax scores from the 540s to the 720s in 4 months. something that i did not think was possible. and it was all thanks to...

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5lgh97/i_raised_my_credit_score_by_73_points_in_3_months/


that subreddit. seriously. i followed the advice in there to the letter, and it worked like magic. here'es a bullet pointed version of exactly what i did: 

•	downloaded credit karma – saw that my score was 546 on jan 15th (was crushed, but felt like i was finally going to start taking control)

•	got my full credit report and list of all accounts that had gone delinquent and/or into collections.

•	called every. single. one. first i disputed every account, and over half (50%) of them could not prove that the accounts were real and/or could not prove that they followed the law pertaining to the fair credit act, and removed the accounts from my credit report.

•	in 30 days my score had gone from 546 to 620! i was elated, and more determined than ever. i felt like i was on a mission at this point. 

•	i applied for and was approved for a capital one secured credit card. it works like this – when your credit is so horrible that you cant get a real credit card to start boosting your credit, you get a secured card. basically, you pay them $200 for a credit card with a $200 limit.. i put $40 on the card every month, and paid it off completely.
 
•	i paid off all of my credit card debt.

•	of the delinquent and/or accounts that i had in collections that were not removed, i negotiated the debt down at every single one. i called them and basically said, ""i don't have enough money to pay my full debt, but i will give you x amount right now, (usually about half of what the debt was) to settle it and remove it from my report. they all had to get their manager's approval, but every single one of these  debt collectors accepted my offers. the way they look at it is like this – ""we either get half, or nothing"" 

•	after 60 days i was up in the 680s… couldn't be happier. then i did something that was not mentioned in the above subreddit..

•	i signed up for a service that sends out letters written on your behalf demanding that they show proof and accuracy of the negative item on your credit report. basically, you pay them a certain amount per month, and they send out attorney written letters to all credit reporting agencies, and debtors on your file, demanding that they prove they followed the law to the letter, and demand that if they cannot, then the record must be erased from my credit report. it's basically a team of attornies and paralegals that work on behalf of their clients to remove delinquent and collections accounts from their credit reports. 

•	less than half of the remaining collections could prove that they followed the process, so they removed the collections from my account. 

•	i then paid off the remaining 2 accounts (down from 17 accounts when i started this)

•	my credit score as of yesterday from both transunion and equifax is now 723. 

•	i applied for a real credit card from chase and was immediately approved for a credit card. 

and that's my story! 
tl;dr – call all your debtors, negotiate the debts down. get credit karma, be religious about not going over 30% of credit card limit, get a secured credit card.

again, thank you everyone on here who helped make this possible, i really wouldn't have been able to do it without you, and i mean that. thank you. 


edit: one huge thing i forgot to mention... i called into my auto loan company and asked them to remove some late payments that were on my report. i had about 4 late payments that were 30+ days, and 2 that were 60+ days. i asked them to remove some, and they did. overnight my credit score went up 22 points. 

edit 2: wow. thanks everyone for the response. i have received many messages from people who we're in a similar experience as i was when i started this journey. thank you so much for your comments and your messages. there are a couple of things i wanted to clear up however.


some people have perceived this guide as ""not ethical"" in the way i removed accounts from my credit report. 

i don't care. you don't have to follow my advice i'm just sharing what i did, and it worked for me. i hold no moral obligation to pay third party debt collectors mountains of money with their fees tacked in. i just played the game and i won. simple as that. you don't have to agree with how i did it, i just wanted to share what i did.

"another example for why having an emergency fund is 1000x better than having more/nicer things. my wife and i are in our early/mid twenties. we have saved a little more than a third of our income over the past two years so we had several thousand dollars in an emergency fund plus extra savings. the amount isn't really relevant - the point is that we had no plans to use it. 

at the end of 2016 we were both in great health, and being young we decided to go with my employer's hdh plan with an hsa. last weekend we blew through the deductible on my wife and we will likely hit the out of pocket maximum before the month is over. this health issue came out of nowhere and we're very fortunate to have good insurance. 

but because we have extra savings, we don't have to make medical decisions based on cost. we can pay the full annual out of pocket maximum and we won't really miss it. if a doctor thinks a test is necessary we can simply authorize it without worrying about how we will pay for it. it has been stressful but i can't imagine how much more stressful it would be if we had to go into medical debt to pay for it all. 

we could have eaten out more last year. my wife could drive a nicer car. we could live in a bigger apartment or house. but i wouldn't trade the freedom of having the extra savings for any of that. 

this came out of nowhere and was frankly highly unlikely. it could happen to anyone.  and we were easily able to pay for it. an emergency fund is psychologically, emotionally, physically, and financially is the most important improvement to your quality of life that you can ""buy."" in my opinion anyway. 

edit: thanks to all for your well wishes and support. to those who took this as a criticism of spending, please know that this was not my intention. my wife and i are not ultra frugal - we simply prioritize our spending where we think it will have the greatest impact on our lives. in my view, an emergency fund is just another thing you ""buy."" i feel that, of all the things anyone could buy, it is the one that will have the greatest impact on your quality of life.",11
"got a performance rating of exceeds expectations. my boss requested a significant salary adjustment and i was denied and given the standard 2.5%. should i quit my job?. i was originally promoted within my company to create a new department about 1.5 years ago. i've since worked my ass off and spent the last year doing managerial level work for non-managerial pay ($47k). 

i initially accepted this offer as it was in line with my experience at the time but i've now shown that my capabilities go far beyond what was originally expected of me. my market value is between $60-75k based on the title i *should* have. 

my boss agreed with this and requested a large pay bump prior to my review. he was denied and told i'd receive the standard 2.5% that everyone else got and could renegotiate in 6 months. 

the problem with this is that i was told the same thing the last time i requested a raise and it was never followed up. 

i've set up a meeting to ask what specific goals and milestones are in place for this 6 month period. 

are they saying to renegotiate in 6 months because raises were already budgeted for review time, or are they just trying to pay me as little as possible. 

worth noting that i love my job - i self manage with hardly any supervision as i chat with my boss every friday about what's going on. should i just leave now or wait until i discuss why my salary adjustment was denied with the ceo?

edit: i don't plan to quit without receiving an offer from another company - just asking if it's worth negotiating with my current employer or if i should just take more money somewhere else. 

edit 2: holy hell i only expected to get 5-10 responses. thanks everyone for the help!

current plan is to discuss why this happened and to also shop around for other jobs. probably won't use an offer as leverage although i've seen others here do so successfully. cheers, all. ",11
"get familiar with your utility bills and pay attention to trends - they can save you tens of thousands of dollars!. like a lot of people every month i get a water bill, electricity bill, internet, you get the idea. most months i open my mail, verify that the bill looks roughly similar to last month and let autopay take care of the rest. 

but since last year i have started an excel spreadsheet documenting what my bills are each month, how many thousands of gallons of water i'm using, kwh used, the whole shebang, in an attempt to be a more financially responsible and understand where my money is going and how i can save.

the last 3 months i noticed my water bill hiking up. my home uses between 2-4k of freshwater monthly but it's gone from 5, to 8, then 8 again. i noticed the trend, but didn't really understand why it increased - i'm not a plumber and there were no leaks in the house i was sure.

fast forward to last evening and i'm out with a group of acquaintances and someone's plumbing problem gets brought up, one of my friends is an awesome plumber and i manage to ask him at the tail end of the conversation about what i noticed on my bill. he seemed immediately alarmed and asked him if i noticed any water accumulation in my front yard. actually, yeah, it's been raining a lot lately but i do have a few persistent pockets left over on my yard. how did he know? this morning he actually brought his crew out to my house and found out there's a crack in my water main - i was losing hundreds of gallons a day and it was on the verge of rupturing completely. he replaced the line for a nominal fee and said how glad he was i said something - my area is really prone to sinkholes and nothing attracts them like pooling or leaking water. i likely saved tens of thousands of dollars in damage to my house and my neighbors house by bringing it up! not to mention the savings in my monthly bill...",11

also, lots of people pming me about having bad credit themselves. look loads of landlords rent to folks with less than perfect credit / criminal history / landlord history / income. honestly i suspect most do. the ones i've worked for definitely do. the folks that almost no one will rent to are the ones who force an eviction immediately after moving in, never intended to pay once they got tenants rights and trash the house on the way out and do this repeatedly. i promise they're out there. tons of folks do this shit. i get we have a housing crisis but its just insane to think we solve this by having every person who has property to rent play craps with their kids college fund or their retirement savings.

also, i get it losers. the proletariat is going to rape my eye holes while i watch my family bleed out. you don't need to keep messaging me that. i've already gotten the message. i suspect you're the same assholes out there trashing houses, destroying people's nest egg / retirement funds / kids college funds / lives.

"google charged me $299.99 for 30tb storage that i did not authorize and now they won't refund my money. i received a notification from paypal at 10:21pm et that a $299.99 charge was made on my wife's google play account. the payment was for 30tb storage for 1 month. my wife's account is only using 7gb (and google offers 15gb free) so it does not make sense that we would want 30tb of storage!  we did not authorize this charge and nobody in my house made this purchase.  kids are sleeping and wife was taking a shower at the time.  i called google immediately and they refused to refund the money saying it happened ""inside the account"" so basically accusing us that we did it.  no suggestions to change our passwords and that it might be an unauthorized charge from a different computer. no information as to which ip address the charge came from was provided. they said to contact paypal to open a dispute if i want. google has canceled the storage account so it is no longer active. i'm not sure what to do but this seems like a very unfair policy from google. any suggestions?

update: i called again this morning and spoke to another representative ""michael"" who was a lot more empathetic and helpful. they submitted the return request again and said it should be approved this time. also a redditor who works for google reached out to me here on reddit and is checking on the case for me from the inside. hopefully i can get this resolved via refund and can close that paypal dispute, since we don't want to lose my wife's account if at all possible. thanks for the support everyone.

update2: success! http://imgur.com/u4yvl6q after talking to the second google representative this morning, and most likely with help from an anon googler who contacted me via reddit pm, they have refunded my money! i have closed the paypal dispute and just waiting for the refund to ""clear"" (currently it is in pending status). i told the second call center rep this morning the exact same thing, we don't know who made this purchase. also i did not mention this reddit post. he was super professional, empathetic and took care of me. even his email was reassuring, he said ""don't worry about it, we will take care of this!""...

lessons learned: 

- be persistent! the first call center rep might give you a hard time but calling back validates or tests their stated policy and in my case it proved that they could in fact help me if they wanted to.

- don't leave credit cards or paypal pre-authorized payment methods connected for years on end. from now on i'll be disconnecting these payment methods as soon as they are used. it's not that hard to retype a credit card or paypal credentials.

- use 2 factor authentication! although there is a possibility this could have been done accidentally in my house by my son (he still hasn't fessed up) this has been an exercise in learning where our security gaps are and making sure we're not too naive when it comes to account protection.

"i've owned the apple card for 3 months, this is why it sucks compared to other credit cards. 1% cashback when using the physical card is absolutely dismal. 2% back on apple pay is limiting and most cards offer between 1.5% and 2% cashback (ie citi doublecash). you'll get that flat cash back regardless of apple pay or not. the 3% back on select stores is okay but honestly is beat by any revolving category cards. most cards now allow you to access your rewards cash as soon as the transaction posts. 

you literally can't even add an authorized user to this card. what kind of 1980s bullshit is this.

the biggest downside of this card is that it will not integrate with any budgeting applications. absolutely ridiculous there isn't out of the box support for mint. considering apple does not have any banking products, this means that users are not getting a holistic view of their finances. in fact, i found it easy to forget exactly how much i was spending on the card because it didn't integrate with mint.


you can pay your bill in two ways, on your phone or by mail. i don't know any credit card provider that is so archaic you can not pay via a web portal.

they also aren't reporting to the credit bureaus right now, although that's slated to change.

"i kept a detailed record of how much was spent to have our baby. here it is.. almost three years ago my wife and i had our first kid. i kept track of everything that we spent money on that was kid related. starting from the pregnancy test to the hospital delivery bill. we also estimated the value of any gift we received to give a full ~~itemized bill~~ idea of how much money was spent on our kid before she was even born. i made an ugly spreadsheet to track it all. i thought about posting this here when i was all done but decided not to because a, i just had a kid and was busy, and 2 i wasn't ready for the criticism i was inevitably going to receive. but, now i am ready and less busy, so here we go. 

starting with the big number:  
to bring our baby into the world from scratch cost $9,984.55.  
my wife and i spent $6445.66.  
we estimated receiving $3,538.89 in gifts.  

i broke everything down into these categories:

category |cost
---|---
gear | $1,661.02
diapers ect. | $119.90
baby clothes | $294.54
mom clothes | $804.30
medical | $4,170.05
books | $248.78
toys | $275.93
bedroom | $2,305.53
feeding | $161.21

in anticipation of some shock on all this spending i'll add that we bought things that we felt would be useful to our lifestyle, within our budget, and that would last for many years to come. we could have spent less, and many people do, and many people actually go well beyond.

**the most expensive things were:**  
the hospital trip to safely have a baby ($3517 delivery related bills combined)  
*-having a baby fall out of a woman in a hospital in america is expensive. this was after insurance covered their portion.*  
a crib + mattress that converts to a toddler bed and full size bed ($890 total - gift)  
*-kid is almost 3 and we converted the crib to the toddler bed shortly after she turned 2. she wasn't a chewer, so it's currently in great shape to stay her bed until her teens or beyond.*  
mom clothes ($804.30)  
*-after seeing this final number i told myself i shouldn't ever gain too much weight because i now know how much a new wardrobe could end up costing me. we were at a point in life where most of the items were bought new and that was ok. 
a new glider chair ($500 - gift)  
*-i wish we could have found this used but didn't have any luck. we wanted one with a high back because i'm tall. i'm thankful we found one, i spent so many nights rocking and dozing in and out of sleep on this thing, i'm very happy with it. we still use it nightly for reading bedtime stories.*    
the stroller ($384)  
*-we got one of those fancy bob running strollers, i ran over a hundred miles with her and we walked plenty of unpaved trails at our local state park. she spent hundreds of hours in this thing. this was the only stroller we used, otherwise we carried her everywhere in the front/back carrier. plus these strollers have a high resale value.*  
car seat + extra base ($375)  
*-we have two cars, a base for each car was great.*  
two camera video baby monitor ($250)  
*-we did a lot of traveling and having the extra camera to just pack and go was really handy. a video monitor is the shit, being able to check and see if a noise was just stirring or something more was great.*  
a cute rug ($239)  
*-a cheap rug would have served the same purpose, but shit it's our first kid, sometimes you gotta get that cute thing.*

writing this with the benefit of hind sight i think we actually did a great job of getting the right thing for us on the first try. we tried to get things with the idea of potentially having another child. of everything major that we bought, the monitor is the only thing we would need to replace if another kid sauntered into our lives. the battery is now totally useless and one of the cameras died last month. also we dropped it, so the power cord is soldiered to the chip and i'm awful at soldiering so it whole housing is glued together to keep it working. 

so can you do this cheaper? absolutely, buy everything used. babies aren't all that picky. i lived in rural illinois at the time and our availability to get nice used stuff was limited. also hand-me-downs can help tremendously, our extended family had kids eight years or more years before us (if they had any) and lived many states away so most of their baby stuff was gone. also, don't underestimate the generosity of others, there are people out there who love babies and love buying baby things, hopefully you know one or two.

another money saving tidbit, use cloth diapers. back when i was weighing the benefits of them, i found we would break even with cloth over disposable at two years. our kid suddenly decided to be potty trained right before christmas so our cloth diapers lasted a bit over 2.5 years, we definitely saved money with cloth. if we accidentally have another kid we will save a ton in diapers because the original ones we got are still in great shape. also, you can find used cloth diapers around which can save tons, we hope to sell ours. a very appreciable downside to cloth, you're guaranteed to be washing the diapers about 2-4 times per week.

a shout out to /r/predaddit for all the helpful tips and stories that were so great at the time. also /u/steeldirigible98 & /u/savingsjada and the several updoots for the courage to finally post this on this sub. i hope this info helps someone out there.",11
"irs says i owe them money, there's a warrant for my arrest, and i should not hang up the phone. i did.. so i just got a call from the ""irs crime"" division regarding tax fraud from 3 random years. they said i owed nearly $4,000 and that i better not hang up the phone or the police would knock on my door within 30 minutes with a warrant for my arrest. they said if i hung up the phone, it would flag their system as me being unwilling to cooperate and legal action, including my arrest, would be put in motion..

"best advice my dad has ever given to me: (1) if you can't afford the monthly payments to pay off your car in 3 years, you can't afford that car. (2) after the car is paid off, continue paying your car payment into a savings account.. by the time you pay off the car, you've budgeted the car payment into your finances.  make it a direct transfer so that you don't give yourself the option to skip a payment.  my car has been paid off for 3 years and i have saved over $12,000 almost effortlessly by using this method. 

edit: this seems to be striking a nerve for many.  this post was written with the intention of helping those who wouldn't invest the difference with a longer loan.  it was meant to offer a simplified idea for saving that worked for me to work for others.   as with everything, there are always better ways to save and invest.  this was just the one that helped me out.  with that said, i've learned a lot by your comments, so thanks for posting!",11

2nd: so i am leaving saturday night to start a career as a truck driver.  my reasons for picking this are varied :  paid training, paid housing (sort of) and the ability to make a little better than average wage once training is complete, which will take several months.  i'm also doing this because i can immerse myself in the work ethic and commitment which i believe will really pay off psychologically. 

you've all been so kind and helpful.  i really can't tell you how much this has meant to me.  i think i would have remained kind of paralyzed if not for your help and guidance.  pls keep the good vibes, thoughts and prayers coming my way, i'll definitely need them.  i will update when i can.  bless you all.

"reminder: you can negotiate your hospital/medical bills down, even if you have insurance. i knocked 30% off my bill for an in-home sleep study with just two phone calls.. *tl;dr even if you have insurance, you can negotiate your hospital bill down a significant percentage. i was successful in getting 30% off my latest bill. thanks, obama.*

i've been futzing with sleep apea for several years (gg gaining 15 pounds in college) and recently decided to ask my primary-care doctor for a referral for a sleep study.

he went through a brief questionnaire with me that ruled out narcolepsy, and boom -- i was scheduled to conduct an in-home sleep study using a machine the hospital provided me. sounded great -- if the test was positive, i'd get a cpap machine free of charge!

what i didn't realize is that the 15 minute appointment to meet with a nurse, who walked me through how to use the machine, would cost exactly $500 after insurance \(hospital/physician services\)(https://imgur.com/a/drgzo). i was barely 10% into my individual annual deductible of $500, so this was going to hurt a lot.

thanks to a post from this person(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5auqdd/reminder_that_you_can_negotiate_your_medical/?st=j95v53cf&sh=3912f619), i decided to call my insurer to get my explanation of benefits explained (eob). once i was satisfied that they were dotting their i's and crossing their t's, i called my hospital to plead my case.

1. my s/o and i are not poor. we are in fact quite privileged and live a comfortable life in the greatest city in america. thanks to good budgeting and a healthy emergency fund, yes we could afford this $500 bill, but it would not be fun. we just welcomed our firstborn child into the world a few weeks ago, and recently purchased a home to boot. 
2. our insurance is actually decent. $500 individual deductible, $1000 family deductible. 100% coverage after either threshold is met. premiums are manageable. 
3. i was stupid and assumed that just because i wasn't meeting with an m.d. in person, i wouldn't be paying more than $100 in hospital/physician services. nope, a neurologist still reviews my test results! duh!

all right, so it's time to call the hospital and plead my case. i dialed the number, entered my account info, and....

**as soon as i explained my situation to the helpful rep from my hospital's financial services department (newborn baby, did not expect such a high bill for a test that i elected to take), i was immediately offered a 30% discount on my $500 bill**. 

i didn't even have to tell them, ""i am only willing to pay $_______"". i was literally quoted an updated figure and told to pay over the phone with a credit card or checking account.

i immediately paid it and thanked the rep for being so helpful. could i have pled for a 50% discount? maybe. but again, my s/o and i have money set aside for unexpected/careless expenditures like this. i should have known better, and i felt it was appropriate to pay at least the majority of my bill.

as for whether i'll be going back for a follow-up test to get my cpap machine.....yeah, we'll see about that.

edit: i should have mentioned earlier, but yes this is a massive ymmv situation. ",11
"psa: it's that time of year again. if ""the irs"" calls you demanding money, it's not the irs.. here is a partial list from the irs of known, common scams:

https://www.irs.gov/uac/tax-scams-consumer-alerts

>note that the irs will never: 1) call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill; 2) demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe; 3) require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card; 4) ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone; or 5) threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.

the irs also offers these tips(https://www.irs.gov/uac/irs-urges-public-to-stay-alert-for-scam-phone-calls) on how to recognize, avoid, and report tax scammers.

##if you get called by a scammer, consider collecting their stated name, phone number they are calling from, and number you are directed to call and reporting it to tigta(https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml) and/or the federal trade commission(https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/gettingstarted?nextqid=216&selected=t%20-%20crnt#crnt) (with ""irs telephone scam"" in the notes).  do not give out any personal information.

i highly recommend that those of us with elderly parents or family members share the word.  the elderly are some of the most vulnerable when it comes to online or telephone scams.

"3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money. how to overcome 3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money.  

 
purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  what i discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was anxiety followed by uncertainty.  in this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  i will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 the worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  this is called buyer's remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  why? well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. i do not want this happen to you!  the following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ emotional manipulation

during my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  one is emotional manipulation.  the reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  ""ma'am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.""  is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  you are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  that awesome new car smell isn't helping either is it?  that feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  they are counting on you to feel this way. 

what happens next is quite primitive.  as our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. when this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  i had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. rip bootsy.  during these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  in this case fear dictated my dog's behaviors.  much like my old boy bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  the budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**how to overcome trick #1 ""emotional manipulation""**

be mindful of your emotions.  simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  i always recommend that we sleep on it.  my rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  this isn't the same as picking up a snickers while in the checkout line. this is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ pushing you towards payments

after the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  this has two benefits for them.  1) making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  we end up paying more this way. (see ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) the interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  the payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6k to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  see below how customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  this is worth repeating...a $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**how to overcome #2 ""pushing you towards payments""**

tell the salesman up front ""i am not interested in going over payments right now, let's stick to the price of the car out the door.""  you must be proactive here.  a skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of ""well ma'am, i just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget"".  just smile at your new adversary and politely say ""while i appreciate your concern, i have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price"".  (make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). they will get the picture.  you want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  you have now become a formidable opponent.  you have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (see ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ the finance office

after a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  here you meet the finance manager.  this person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  this is where even the toughest buyers lose.  why? they lose because their guard is down.  when we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   you give out a big sigh of relief.  in my sales days, i will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. he knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  he clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (nice job!). what happened next really opened my eyes.  he ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and gap products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in example 3)  all of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  don't let this happen to you.  being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
i want you to know the background of the finance managers and how they get that job.  it's not by going to business school and majoring in finance.  they get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  that is part of the car sales business ladder.  it takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  you can't put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  they are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

the first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  let's nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  he has one clear goal.  convince us to buy what he has.  he doesn't make as much money otherwise.  he will once again show us the new payments if we were to purchase products a, b, or c.  they make money in 2 ways.  the first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  they borrow your loan money from bank a for 3% and charge you 4%.  the dealership gets a part of that and the finance manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  see ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   the second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**how to overcome #3 ""the finance office""**

as before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  it really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. i personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  don't let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  the convenience is worth it for some.  (see example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
good luck!  i hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  i hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.   
 
 
**example1**

 we are purchasing a $25,000 car.  let's say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
the salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. ""which one works better for you sir?""  do you see what he did there?  he changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from his two options.  many people lose here. they say they like one of the payments and lose or they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  the salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (they always come back higher).  great. car is sold.  let's do the math though.  you wanted to be at $22,000.  by accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle and you have no idea what the interest rate is.  the lesson here: keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  when that is settled then work on payments. 
 
**example 2**

a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ you will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ you will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
that is a difference of $720
know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**example 3**

be familiar with the products before you go into the finance office.

extended warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
the $4500 example above was many years ago. competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  still, do your homework and check around. credit unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  companies like state farm insurance now do auto financing and will give you gap for free if you finance through them!  my credit union charges $349 for gap. dealerships charge $750 and above.  i hope you can appreciate the value.

"""maxing out your 401(k)"" means contributing $18,500 per year, not just contributing enough to max out your company match.. unless your company arbitrarily limits your contributions or you are a highly compensated employee you are able to contribute $18,500 into your 401(k) plan. in order to max out you would need to contribute $18,500 into the plan of your own money. 

all that being said. contributing to your 401(k) at any percentage  is a good thing but i think people get the wrong idea by saying they max out because they are contributing say 6% and ""maxing out the employer match""",11
"you're taking a huge risk by linking venmo or paypal to your primary banking accounts.. your checking/savings accounts are very secure. they are heavily regulated including numerous laws designed to protect consumers.

venmo/paypal is none of the above. it is possible for someone to gain access to your venmo account (either by hacking in or even by sending you an unauthorized transfer). your connected checking/savings account can then be drained.

a lot of people mistakenly assume than venmo offers the same or even better consumer protections against fraud as their bank account, but this is untrue. having a secure checking account and then connecting it to venmo/paypal is like locking your door, arming your alarm and then leaving all your windows wide open.

**what should you do instead?**

there are at least two better options:

**for infrequent users, use a credit card (not a debit card) to send money, and just leave incoming transfers in venmo.**

yes, you will have to pay a fee for each cc transaction (usually 3%), but that 3% pays for an additional level of fraud prevention/protection from the cc company. for incoming transfers, it's not going to hurt anything to leave a few hundred dollars parked in venmo.

**for frequent users, link an air gap checking account to your venmo.**

lots of industries use air gaps as part of their safety/security protocols. an air gap checking account is an account that's connected to venmo and not connected to anything else. if you want to transfer money to/from your air gap account, you'll need to physically withdraw cash from one account and physically deposit it in the other.

sure, both of these options may be inconvenient, and they may cost some extra money in cc fees or account fees. but here's the thing you need to keep in mind: if you can't afford to pay 3% in cc fees, or you can't afford to leave $200 parked in venmo, or you can't afford the account fees to open another checking account, then **you definitely can't afford to have your primary banking accounts drained** by fraudulent venmo charges.",11

"when it comes to discuss salary, your current salary is irrelevant.. recently i was in contact with several headhunters via linkedin. i could not spend time energy doing all the calls and interviews, so i asked (nicely) the headhunters about the salary range and benefits. some never got back to me. some asked me about my current salary and my expectation. 

i simply said no, my current salary is irrelevant.

this is something that was commonly advised, but i don't think everyone understand how important it is.

in most of the cases, the company already has a budget for the new position, and also in most of the cases, they want to pay as little as possible ( unless you are crazily good and they are really desperate to get you). if they can pay you less and still make you happy (because it's already 30% higher than your current salary), why would they pay you more (even if they totally can)? ( such employers exist, but they are not the majority). same goes as expected salary.

you are worth what you bring to your new employer. you might be heavily underpaid with your current employer, but that has nothing to do with the negotiations.

for me, it is always salary and benefits upfront. if it is a match then i will proceed further, otherwise, ""thanks, but may be next time"". that saves both sides time and effort. they already know a fair amount of my information from my linkedin profile, therefore, what to expect from me, why can't i know what i can expect from them.

in the end i got back a few ranges, which i politely said i will not proceed further, and only continued with 2 headhunters that provide a number i am comfortable with (even though it contains the infamous phrase""up to"", at least i know what i can expect). 

am waiting for an offer, but that is a different story. (edit: by ""waiting"", i meant i got words from a potential employer that they are working on an offer tailored specific for me (i let them know what i demand and they basically agreed on the terms, but the details need to be worked on. i am not just waiting for any offer)",11
"dash cams. after my wife telling me numerous stories of being ran off the road and close calls, i researched and ultimately purchased two $100 dash cams for both of our vehicles for a total of about $198 on amazon . they came with a power adapter and a 16gb micro sd card as a part of a limited time promotion. i installed both of them earlier this year by myself within a few hours by using barebones soldering skills and some common hand tools for a ""stealth wiring"" configuration. 

recently, my wife was in an accident and our dash cam has definitively cleared us of all liability. the other party claimed that my wife was at fault and that her lights were not on. her dash cam showed that not only was my wife's lights on prior to the impact, but the other party was shown clearly running a stop sign which my wife failed to mention in the police report due to her head injury. needless to say, our $200 investment has already paid for itself. 

with all of that in mind, i highly recommend a dash cam in addition to adequate insurance coverage for added financial peace of mind. too many car accidents end up in he said/she said nonsense with both parties' recollection being skewed in favor of their own benefit. 

car accidents are already a pain. do yourselves a favor and spend $100 and an afternoon installing one of these in your vehicle. future you will inevitably thank you someday. 

edit: thanks everyone for sharing your stories and asking questions. i'm glad i can help some of you out. with that said, i keep getting the same question frequently so here's a copy/paste of my response. 


wheelwitness hd is the dash cam i own. 

honestly, anything with an above average rating of 4 stars in the $100 range that isn't a recognized name brand is pretty much a rebrand of other cameras. if it has a generic name, i can guarantee you that they all use a handful of chipsets that can record at different settings depending on how capable it is. the only difference will be the physical appearance but guts will mostly be the same. 

as a rule of thumb, anything $100+ will probably be a solid cam. i recommend a function check monthly at a minimum. i aim to do it once a week. i found mine frozen and not recording one day. just needed a hard reboot. ",11
"credit freezes are now free. starting today.. edit 4:
i'm re-arranging and cleaning up the post to show info in a clean format, so as to answer many of the questions than has been asked, because i can't answer questions timely any more, because this post blew up. but i want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. 

**what is a credit freeze?**

a credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. it protects you against identity theft. even if a hacker knows all your info, including your ssn, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.

other replies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dk0sx/

**why is this news important now?**

many experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. starting friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. in the wake of a massive data breach last year at equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million americans, congress amended the fair credit reporting act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the united states. the bill was passed in may(https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/free-credit-freeze/index.html). it is effective as of today.(https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/free-credit-freezes/index.html)

**how can i do it?**

to set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: 

experian(https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html)

equifax(https://www.freeze.equifax.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

transunion(https://freeze.transunion.com/sf/securityfreeze/landingpage.jsp). 

chexsystems(https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/placefreeze/)

innovis (https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityfreeze)

nctue (https://exchangeservicecenter.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

you will be given a pin that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. 

**do i have to do this with all credit agencies? i only have one credit card**

yes you do. your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. 

**does this mean that i can freeze my credit score at 810? does freezing affect my score?**

no. a credit freeze only freezes who can *see* your credit record. your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. freezing does not affect your score.


**is credit unfreeze/thaw also free?**

yes.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6d4v8e/)

**how long does the ""thaw"" process takes before credit is available to be pulled?**

if you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.

**what if i lose my pin? how do i recover it**

from several posts i saw, there are methods to recover your pin/ and access your account that involves snail mail. you get letters in regular mail, which i assume is for confirming your physical address.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dg4bc/


**how accurate is this info?**

to the best of my knowledge. i will update as i find better info.

"if you get ""highs"" spending money, consider downloading an app that lets you pay down student loans. this isn't my idea but i couldn't find who posted it long ago when i saw it. well, i did it and it's worked well.  i found myself going out for a drink or bite to eat when i didn't really have a great reason to. instead, i took that money i would have spent and payed down a loan with a quick click. (not always) it feels great. about as great as i felt getting that drink on the way home after work. i did try robinhood too but that felt very different to me and wasn't as rewarding.

edit: the app i use is my lenders, great lakes. people here are saying use changed as well which works like acorn. 

edit: yes, i know playing the market may yield more than paying down my lower interest loans but that's not the point. it is to chip away at a daunting 10+ year loan. it is also no risk.",11
"i caught myself shopping for a new car (that i can't afford) because mine was ""worn out"".. i have a 2006 honda accord 4cyl that has 225,000 miles on it. i drive it to and from work every day (for 5 years) and it has been acting up on me lately. a tire leaks air, the brakes are bad, and i'm having troubles while accelerating. not to mention my two toddlers have trashed the interior. i chalked it up to being time to buy an upgrade.


i started searching for cars online. i can get this 2016 for just $18,000! but i might as well go new for a lower interest rate. that's only $25,000 for a brand new car. i have about $2,000 budgeted for car repairs that i can add to trade-in value on my accord and will come away with a super nice vehicle at a low monthly rate.


as i continued searching, i kept trying to fight reality. in actuality, i have the ability to fix every one of these issues, but my own laziness is tempting me to find the easy way out.


i got online and found new brake rotors and pads, air and oil filters, and spark plugs. i got my oil from a local mega-chain. in one day i plugged a tire (nail), changed my air filter, changed out the brakes, changed my oil, and changed my plugs. in total it may have cost me a hundred bucks and a weekend day. i also cleaned up all the trash and clothes, and vacuumed the car. i felt so accomplished when i was finished.


i swear, it feels like i'm driving a whole new car. now looking back, it seems silly that i wanted to buy a new car just for convenience of not having to deal with preventative maintenance. before you make a large purchase, take a step back and ask yourself if it's really necessary. i consider myself great with money but apparently very lazy as well haha.



edit: many posters have recommended other semi-diy preventative maintenance jobs for older cars. do these at your own risk. there should be plenty of instructional videos on youtube. (in no particular order):


replace water pump

replace control arm bushing

replace tie rod end

flush brake fluid

change transmission fluid

replace serpentine belt

clean mass airflow/map sensor

clean throttle body

replace fuel filter

replace shocks/struts",11
"student loan balance: $0. thank you pf for all of your help, and please accept my personal contribution.. **edit (2019.01.03):** updated template can be found in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac701m/happy_new_year_pf_after_a_year_and_a_half_i_am/).

**edit:** several people requested access to the spreadsheet. you shouldn't need to request access. you should be able to `file > make a copy...`. please pm me if you are unable to do so.

i was raised in a family where finances were not ever discussed other than the fact that we did or did not have it. my father was an optimistic entrepreneur who struck gold, time and time again on many of his business ventures, but always found a way to blow through his riches with little to show for it. factor in my mother who was a hoarder and you had the perfect formula for disaster. i won't stroll too deep down memory lane, but long story short, i never completed my college degree and decided to go straight into the workforce instead.

seven years ago, i was laid off from a job that was ""paying the bills"" with no degree to fall back on. i made the decision to go back to school and about two years into my degree, i was caught in a financial bind, worrying about how i was going to take care of next semester's tuition. fortunately for me, i had an amazing aunt, uncle, sister, and bil who helped cover my expenses. after that incident, i swore to myself that as soon as i graduated, i would take charge of my own finances and do everything in my power to avoid going down the same path as my parents.

i've been a long-time lurker and have read countless personal stories shared on this subreddit throughout the years. even if the situation didn't apply to my own life, i took the time to sympathize with what others are going through in the event that i too may one day endure the same hardship. i silently cheered behind the scenes along with each success story shared. this sub is a daily read for me and became my source of encouragement towards living a debt-free life.

today, i get to share my own success story. i made a plan after graduating to aggressively pay off my student loans and have been blessed enough to have the means to do. i have made the final payment on my student loans. from $22,601.14 to $0 in 27 months.

along with the good news, i wanted to give back to the community that has been so helpful all these years. i created a spreadsheet to track my various finances and i'm hoping that it will help others as well.

**personal finance template:** 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjhe3atepyuoe1wzpb9wmr2h7vfj45_iqc1jutr4wly/edit?usp=sharing

it may seem like there is a lot going on, but i will try my best to describe each tab in-depth to make it seem less scary.

**student loans:** my student loans were broken down into different groups (a, b, c, d) at different interest rates. i wanted to calculate the total interest over the life of each loan based on a set payment amount, so i made a rough amortization chart.

> **f2:** enter your interest rate.  
> **h2:** enter your desired monthly payment.  
> **m2:** enter your loan balance.

i wanted to find the sweet spot for what i felt comfortable paying while also trying to minimize the total accrued interest as best as i could, so i played around with various numbers for `h2`.

as an example, i entered $200 in `h2`. now i am searching for the row where the value in `column m` is negative. this happens in `m30`.

that means that if i make a monthly payment of $200 (`h2`), i would pay it off in 30 months (`g32`) and accrue $281.64 of total interest (`k32`).

i repeated the same process for $56.57 (the recommended minimum payment from my student loan provider), $150, $175, and $250 and then made a chart in `o1:r6` (http://i.imgur.com/c2yuvqg.png).

i calculated the savings based on how much **less** interest i would pay over the life of the loan if i paid more than the minimum payment. this became such a big motivator for me to continue to make aggressive payments that i decided to add it to the **summary** tab.

**summary:** this tab is exactly what it sounds like; it is a summary of all of my finances so that i can get a snapshot view of where my money is, along with my net worth, average credit score, and student loan ""savings"".

> **b2:** i update this formula once a month. currently the formula is `='2017.06'!$q$200`, pointing to the `2017.06` spreadsheet.. when june ends, i will simply update the formula to point to `='2017.07'!$q$200`.  
> **b10:** this is also updated monthly. next month, i would change the formula from `='credit score'!$f$20` to `='credit score'!$f$21`.

**2017.04, 2017.05, 2017.06:** this is where the bulk of the work comes in.

> **a:** enter the date of the posted transaction. if the transaction is still pending, leave the date blank until it has posted.  
> **b:** enter the merchant for the transaction. this column uses the **merchants** tab for data validation. to add a new merchant, simply add another entry in column **a** of the **merchants** tab.  
> **c:** enter the category for the transaction. this simply helps categorize your spending. use the **categories** tab for data validation.  
> **d:** enter all credit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **e:** enter all debit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **f:j**: i have four credit cards that i use in rotation. enter all credit card transactions under the corresponding column (adjust columns as needed).  
> **k:** this column shows the current balance of your bank account.  
> **l:p:** these columns shows the current balance of each of your credit cards.  
> **q:** i call this column the ""reality check"". it shows your true balance: the cash you have in your bank account minus all of the debts across your credit cards.
> **s:t:** this gives you a breakdown of where you are spending your money. it is another helpful way to keep your spending in check and should help you budget.

it might seem like a lot of work, but it has become routine enough for me that it takes me no more than 10 minutes in the morning.

my routine:  

1. log into charles schwab.
2. enter pending transactions (columns **b:j**).
3. enter dates for previously pending transactions (column **a**).
4. repeat 1-3 for citi, discover, amex, capital one.
5. select the columns that are out of order, then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`.

let's go through an example. 

in tab `2017.06`, i have the following pending transactions: http://i.imgur.com/xk1v89r.png

after logging into my accounts, i found that these transactions are all posted now, so i have entered the dates of the posted transactions in column `a`: http://i.imgur.com/wcry4gh.png

my transactions are out of order, which will happen often with pending transactions, so now i have to sort them.

i select columns `a53:j39` up to posted date `6/11`: http://i.imgur.com/b9rjttp.png

then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`: http://i.imgur.com/uib4kk7.png

my transactions are now sorted! http://i.imgur.com/qw7fw9r.png

that is pretty much all i do for daily transactions, though there are two things i want to make note of.

> **paying credit card bills:** when paying a credit card bill, i enter a debit in column `e` as well as a credit in the corresponding credit card column.
> 
> for instance, i paid my citi credit card bill on 6/2/2017 in the amount of $143. this is what that transaction looks like: http://i.imgur.com/fltk8bl.png

> **look-ahead:** often times, i will enter transactions that have not happened yet further down the spreadsheet. for example, if i know i have a credit card bill due later this month, or a rent payment, or an incoming paycheck, i will enter it in order to ""look ahead"" of my finances. this teaches me discipline in how i am spending my current balance while making sure that i am preparing for upcoming expenses.
> 
> an example of this can be seen in rows `90:91`: http://i.imgur.com/o5nhlrw.png
> 
> i know that i have a credit card bill due on 7/3, and i also have another paycheck coming on 6/30. entering both of these transactions allows me to gauge how prepared i am when that time comes.

at the end of the month, i simply right-click `2017.06` and click `duplicate`, renaming the new spreadsheet to `2017.07`. i also make sure that all of the formulas in `d2:j2` correctly point to the previous month.

> **d2:** change `='2017.05'!k200` to `='2017.06'!k200`  
> **f2:** change `='2017.05'!l200` to `='2017.06'!l200`  
> **g2:** change `='2017.05'!m200` to `='2017.06'!m200`  
> **h2:** change `='2017.05'!n200` to `='2017.06'!n200`  
> **i2:** change `='2017.05'!o200` to `='2017.06'!o200`  
> **j2:** change `='2017.05'!p200` to `='2017.06'!p200`

**ally savings 1.00% apy**: this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**stocks owned:** i use this tab to keep track of the current stocks that i own.

> **a:** enter the stock ticker.  
> **b:** enter the purchase date.  
> **c:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d:** enter the purchase price.

rows `25:37` helps me track when i should sell the stock and what my net gain/loss would be.

> **c26:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d26:** enter the purchase price.

the chart will show you what the sell price would be for a `10.00% - 65.00%` gross profit.

**stocks sold:** this just helps me keep track of my stocks sold over the years. i copy and paste the values directly from **stocks owned** when i choose to sell.

**401k:** this tab tracks all of my 401k transactions.

> **c:** enter the money contributed for the month.  
> **d:** enter the amount of gain/loss for the month.

columns `g:i` will give you the year-to-date statistics, but it is pretty barebones at the moment.

**hsa:** this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**hsa investment:** this tab follows a similar structure as the **401k** tab.

**credit score:** this tab keeps track of my monthly free credit estimates offered by my credit cards. columns `h:i` tracks roughly what date a new credit score is available. it's interesting to see how your credit score is affected month to month based on various factors. for instance, my credit utilization was high from 09/2016 - 12/2016 due to the holidays and various trips. my credit took a dip for that period and then has been slightly rising since.

"grandparents gifted me & s/o 100g of 99.99% gold to start a college fund, since we are expecting a baby. how do i convert this literal bar of gold into a more fungible/secure investment?. photo of the gold bar(http://imgur.com/b2al4np). i have no idea if the serial number or seal i covered up are secure, so my apologies if this is a terrible photo

i looked around for any advice about selling gold and apmex, local coin collectors, and /r/pmsforsale were all recommended. ""cash for gold"" stores were universally panned. 

however, since i'm interested in eventually throwing this money into an index fund (maybe even a gold etf) i was wondering if there's an easier way to liquidate this directly with a bank. 

any help is really appreciated since i've never held more than a single silver dollar in my hand before. thanks!

edit: wow this blew up! thanks y'all. to clarify a few things: yes my grandparents are chinese, but no they don't care about the gold bar remaining physically gold. they're much more interested in the grandkid becoming a doctor, so if reinvesting the gold bar helps that, they're fully on board :) ",11

all,

this thread will serve as the r/personalfinance official mega thread for discussing the recent equifax security breach(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-07/equifax-reports-cybersecurity-incident-potentially-impacting-143-million-u-s-customers). /r/legaladvice also has a mega thread on this issue(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6yvj5c/megathread_equifax_security_breach/) if you want to focus on legal options. the tl;dr of that thread is wait to join a class action and do not sue in small claims court.

**summary:**

* ""equifax inc. said its systems were struck by a cyberattack that may have affected about 143 million u.s. customers of the credit reporting agency...some u.k. and canadian residents were also affected."" canadian thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinancecanada/comments/6yq9gu/equifax_hacked_canadian_consumers_might_be/) and uk thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/comments/6yvunm/misc_uk_details_in_equifax_data_breach/)

* ""intruders accessed names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers...credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers were also accessed.""

* ""criminals took advantage of a ""u.s. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files"" from mid-may through july of this year...the intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.""

* ""the company set up a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised. it's also offering free credit-file monitoring and identify-theft protection.""

* the purpose of this sub is not to provide legal advice. however, per https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/frequently-asked-questions/
""the arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the trustedid premier terms of use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident.""

* **identity theft wiki** - please see the identity theft wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for steps to take if your identity has been stolen. you may wish to freeze your credit with the different reporting agencies. note that their websites are currently under a heavy load and may be unresponsive. for more information on what freezing your credit means, see the ftc's explanation(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#score)

equifax also recently announced(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896) that they are waiving fees for freezing your credit with them. it is unclear if they plan to offer refunds to those that paid to do so before today.

**using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:**

* a helpful discussion adapted from u/likeasomebodie on using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:

* check to see if you are effected using this link(https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/)

* either of the following messages from equifax mean your information was stolen:

thank you -- based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident...

thank you -- your enrollment date for trustedid premier is: xxxxxx please be sure to mark your calendar...

* either of these messages mean that your ssn, dob, full address, and potentially dl number have been stolen. assume that information is now public data, because if it's not out there already someone's indexing it right now.

* please note that some media outliets are reporting that these messages are not completely reliable(https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/) however, it still appears that using this site provides at least some information, even if it is not completely accurate.

* see the identity theft guide(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for additional information on freezing your credit, next steps, etc...

**additional information:**

* your credit card company may offer some form of identity theft protection/credit monitoring. you should review the benefits that your card has to see if this applies to you.

* equifax is making credit freezes free for some customers; it isn't clear if this extends to everyone or only certain individuals. update - it should be free to all - see the announcement here(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896). no word on whether previously paid fees will be refunded, but you can call and ask.

* it appears that, in some cases, the pin you get from equifax when freezing your credit is just a time stamp of when the freeze was initiated(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/your-money/identity-theft/equifax-breach-credit-freeze.html). if this happened to you, consider requesting a new pin by mail.

* some individuals are reporting difficulty obtaining a credit freeze online. you may need to submit documents via mail if this is the case.

* there is now at least 1 class-action lawsuit(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit) on this issue. please keep in mind that per equifax's most recent financials, it has a book value of equity of only about 3 billion dollars on total assets of about 7 billion dollars, so it seems unlikely that 70 billion, even if awarded, could actually be paid.

* u/rholowczak has put together a handy tree of phone options when calling the major credit bureaus here(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yv4gb/official_mega_thread_recent_equifax_security/dmyg4xe/).

"my new rules for ""lending"" money.... so, when my husband and i first started trying to take our finances seriously, we noticed a particular big leak in our finances.  lending friends and family money.  my husband and i have a lot of friends who have... for lack of a more gracious term... never gotten their shit together.  since we have been making decent money for years, they started getting into the habit of calling us when they got in a financial bind.  $100 here, $20 there, $1000 there.  i realized that we very rarely ever saw any of it back.  i needed to put a stop to this, but i still wanted to be able to help my loved ones when needed.

so i came up with some rules when lending money to loved ones.

1) i never loan money.  if i can't afford to just give it to you, then i can't afford to loan it to you.  it is a gift, and i never expect to see it back.  whether you give it back is completely up to you, and we're still just as good of friends if you don't.  i will never let money come between us.

2) you only get one gift.  if you give it back, then it is no longer a gift, and you are welcome to another gift should you ever need it.  there is no limit to how many gifts you can receive and return, but only one at a time.

3) no, you cannot receive a gift, and then a day/week/month later decide you need to ""add on"" to that gift.  ask for everything you expect to need and then even a little more if you like, but no adding on more later.

4) no means no.  if you try to guilt me or otherwise manipulate me if i refuse to give you money, i will walk away, and we will not be friends or speak again until you understand that you just made me feel used and only valuable to you as a wallet.  i will only forgive this once.  more than once is a pattern that speaks volumes about what i am to you.

so far, this has gone well.  both good friends we have given money to under these rules chose to pay us back over time, and have not requested a second gift yet.  i think being able to repay us on completely their own time, of their own volition, and without any pressure from us made them feel more comfortable and respected.  we've lost some friends over money before we established these rules.  i'm really hoping that this might help plug the financial drain, and preserve friendships at the same time.

if you have any suggestions that could improve this, please feel free to post them. :) 

update: wow. well, i did not expect this to blow up like it has, but that's really cool and i appreciate all the activity, compliments, discussion, and the gold from two lovely people. :) i'm trying to answer any questions directed at me, but on mobile this is a lot to shift through, so feel free to tag me or whatever if you want me to answer or comment on something. thanks everyone for an awesome discussion :)",11
"friendly reminder that there's no harm in asking your credit card company to refund your late fee.. (though it's no excuse of course) i have been rather busy this past month and recently got sick and forgot to pay my chase credit card bill, which meant i ended up with a $25 late fee. i just paid today, which was about 2 days late, and immediately after paying online, i called their customer service number.

funnily enough, i didn't even have to ask for her to refund the late fee, because she knew right away that that was what i was calling for. i remained polite and she refunded it for me. (i also have the fact that i typically pay the bill on time and this was my first time paying late, so if you're a late payer, this is probably not the best policy).

there's no harm in asking!",11

"there's no such thing as a ""1099 employee."" if your employer controls where and how you work and how you get paid, you're probably a w-2 employee and not an independent contractor.. i see quite a few threads on this sub asking about taxes and pay as an ""independent contractor"" or ""1099 employee"" where the op goes on to say they have a set schedule, set work assignments, and get paid at regular intervals. this is not what an independent contractor is, and there's a good chance the worker in question is being misclassified as a contractor when they're in fact an employee.

employers misclassify employees as contractors in order to avoid paying payroll taxes like unemployment insurance premiums and the employer's share of fica (social security and medicare) withholdings. the misclassified workers also don't get the protection of worker's compensation or other employment laws. it's a rampant problem (especially in recent years), and any ""independent contractor"" should take a careful look at their business relationship.

there are laws in most states that distinguish a true contractor from an employee, and the irs has its own set of standards (see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee)). in a nutshell, being a contractor or employee comes down to how much control the business paying you has over your work and finances.

* if the business you're working for can tell you when, where, and how to work or has set methods/procedures, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if your job performance is measured against the business's standards, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if the business you're working for reimburses your expenses, gives you tools/equipment and materials to do your work, or pays you by the hour, week, month, etc., you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you only work for one company, provide services to them full-time, and do so continuously (i.e. not project-based work), you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you can quit or be fired at any time without cause/notice or financial repercussions (i.e. working at-will), you're probably not an independent contractor.

if you think you might actually be an employee based on factors like these, but are getting a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 and are being treated as a ""contractor,"" **please report it** to your state's revenue agency, unemployment agency, and/or labor department. you can also file form ss-8 with the irs, but the irs is very underfunded/understaffed right now, so you may want to reach out to your state's agencies first. your state can probably do an audit and then refer the findings to the irs on its own.

worker misclassification is a huge problem that needs more attention. businesses might save on payroll taxes by passing off employees as ""contractors,"" but the misclassified worker gets all of the tax liability and none of the protections.

tl;dr – employees get misclassified as ""independent contractors"" all the time. know the factors and report it if you think something's amiss.",11
"i'm 25, i hate my corporate desk job, and i have about 30,000 saved up. what can i do investment wise to get out of this while i'm still young?. as the title states i'm getting really unhappy at my current job. i don't have any debt minus my car note (have about $12,000 left which i intend to pay off in 24 months). my monthly expenses come out to about \~$1100 with rent/bills. i'm in a position where my job is draining the life out of me and i'm losing the energy and charisma i used to have. i do intend on speaking with a financial advisor but i would greatly appreciate any help because i'm honestly afraid of slowly becoming too depressed and unmotivated to do anything about it. i also can't deal with interest due to religious constraints so unfortunately i understand that it limits my options somewhat. i truly appreciate any advice that anyone can offer. i'm just in a position in my life where i want to make a change to be happy once more. thank you everyone.

"i have 2 master degrees and haven't been able to find a job for the past 12 months. i don't know what i'm doing wrong.. i have a masters in math and one in finance, both from state schools. finished both with 4.0s. i did my undergrad at a ""public ivy,"" but only got a 2.75 there. i was happy with my scholastic performance turnaround and only applied for competitive jobs at the beginning of my job search. as time has passed, i've been applying to anything and everything. i've been living off of a small inheritance, but that money is almost gone. i've recently applied to be a teller at a bank and at a local target - no interview for either.

"someone walked into a branch pretending to be me and got a debit card replacement. withdrew $1000 immediately. advice needed. this happened in toronto earlier this month. the bank is cibc. 

&#x200b;

yesterday i found out that i could not log into my mobile banking app and called their service number. i was told somebody walked into a branch with a fake id and claimed he lost his debit card. apparently the teller gave him a replacement and added a new contact number to the account. he withdrew 1000 dollar from atm. he then went to money mart and try to get more cash which caused cibc to trigger a fraud alert and locked the card. i have been overseas since august and won't be able to come back until next february. i have my debit card with me the entire time. haven't receive any funny messages or emails. i was told a investigation case has been opened and i should call then back in 10 business days. meanwhile a new debit card would be mailed to my current address (overseas). once i have received it i can access online banking again. i am quite baffled by what happened. i have chequing, visa, mortgage and line  with cibc. without online banking i could not access my accounts or even try to see if any other accounts have been compromised. furthermore i do not know what kind of personal information has been leaked. did the bad guys just know my name and address and then made a false id and tried their luck at different banks? or is there some other things they have got about me that made the teller believe he is the real deal? btw i have an obvious chinese name. which might make impersonating me a possibility. 

&#x200b;

right now this seems surreal and i just have a lot of questions. will i be liable about the $1000? any further steps should i take to minimize other potential losses? should i inform the police or is the bank doing that? can i make a police report while overseas? any advice is deeply appreciated. many thanks.

"if your bank calls you, even if the phone number is legit, don't verify anything, call them back first. this may also get posted in /r/tifu(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu) as well ... 'cause i'm a dummy.

got a call today from my bank (caller id confirmed) saying they'd seen fraud on my atm card (telling me the last 4 digits of my atm card) at a walmart in florida.

i live in colorado. of course that wouldn't be me, and yes i do have the atm card in my possession. they never asked for the full card number.

while they put me on a brief hold to verify something, i did a reverse lookup on the phone number, it did match my bank. they sent me an sms code to verify over the phone, the shortcode of the sending number also matched my bank's sms shortcode.

figured everything was legit, gave them my home address to ship me my new card. they put me back on hold ""to talk to a manager"" to waive an additional fee to expedite sending the card.

but it was not my bank.

while they put me on that second hold they withdrew almost $1,000 in small increments at an atm in california. (again, i live in colorado)

i hung up, \*i\* called my bank, they verified they did not call me, had no record of possible fraud in florida but that the six atm withdrawals in california did flag as fraud.

i happened to record the phone call of the ""bank"" calling me, so i'm sending the phone recordings to my \*actual\* bank.

meanwhile i have to wait 10 days to get the $1,000 back. yay.

thank goodness for things like an emergency fund, so the lack of the cash doesn't hurt, but still a major nuisance.

quick edit: thanks for the incoming messages about this and the genuine support. many have had similar experiences, and i posted this as a reminder to all that you should always call your bank yourself to verify anything, never verify anything on an incoming call.

\---

**edit for clarification from several comment conversations:**

here's what likely happened: they spoofed my bank's phone number, asked me where i wanted the new atm card shipped thus i verified my mailing address. they followed my bank's verification playbook and said they were sending me a verification code via sms, which i then relayed. what was very likely happening on another phone line was they were social-engineering my bank, pretending to be me, verified my mailing address, verified the sms code which i relayed to them, and likely changed my atm card pin so they could withdraw cash. even down to my bank charging a fee for rushing a new card and waiving the fee in case of fraud. this was a very clever social engineering feat.

**also an important note:** there are tons of apps out there which can record phone calls, but the legality of this depends on where you live and the location where the person/business on the other end of the call are located. one comment has a link to a lawsuit where the second party was not in a one-party-consent state, which makes recording a phone call illegal. always tell your caller that you're recording the call. i miss being on google voice that could play a message that you were recording the call etc..

\---

**friendly reminder of the day** (besides drink more water, go out and enjoy some sunshine, and be nice to one another)

if someone calls, claiming to be your bank, never verify any information even if everything like phone numbers and sms seem to match. thank them for the alert, and tell them that you'll call them right back. do not provide any information to them!",11
"you don't always need to buy a new car to get the latest features.. i have a friend with 6 year old civic that's paid off and only has 55k miles. about a month ago, i was surprised to hear him talking about getting a new car again. i asked him why he wanted to get rid of his civic and he said he rented a new car on his trip that had proximity entry, push button start, and android auto/apple carplay built in. i'm not gonna lie, once you try and get used to those, it's hard to go back to a key and regular stereo so i understood where he's coming from.

well, years ago in high school and college, i used to install car audio, alarms, remote starters, all that. i told him he can add all those features to his civic. we added proximity lock/unlock, push button start, 7"" stereo with bluetooth, android auto, and apple carplay, and a backup camera. all that ended up costing him just over $500 but now he has a car that he loves again and doesn't have to drop 20-30k on a new car. i helped him install it but even at a professional shop, that's probably no more than $1000 total.

i know there are multiple reason to buy a new(er) car, but if you like your car and just want newer features, take a look at what products are out there, you might be able to add those features to your car and save a lot of money in the long run.


edit: many people asked, so here's a partial list:

- 2102t directed pke passive keyless entry system. works extremely well, dei makes quality products. most bad reviews i've seen online were from people that didn't understand how to install it. this is a kit for professional installers so dei does not give any tech support for diy installs. 

- the stereo is user preference since there are many to choose from but he got a pioneer avh-2300nex. if you want to go cheaper, i have an atoto sa102 in my car and it doesn't have any issues. but there are probably hundreds of stereos to choose from

- push button was a generic one he found online, i don't have the mode number. just find one with decent reviews on amazon. they come in different styles so that will be user preference as well. you also need an immobilizer bypass module if your key is chipped.

- backup camera was from amazon, they are all pretty much the same so pick whatever style fits your car best.",11
"received a promotion in february with no raise, was told they would give me a raise after my year end review, reached out to past employee to find she was making $3 more than i am, started applying else where and got offered $5 more an hour. current job matched, so i stayed.. and i couldn't be happier, the big factors i had to consider was the new job has more opportunity for growth in the future, but it would have added 1 - 1.5 hours to my commute each day. i had a huge fear that my current employer would treat me differently because of this situation but they haven't at all, and i'm working 4-7 hours of over time now (which i wouldn't have been able to at the other job because of child care limitations and the extra commute.

edit#2 first of all: thank you! i am grateful for all the incredible support and good advice. i am currently working on communicating with different institutions for tangible help like for starters, legal. i will need to wait for the death certificate to actually start going places, the top priority is to dwell into ssn as so many of you rightfully pointed me to. i am doing well, i am peaceful i am optimistic. friends of reditt, you are all magnificent.

"i always heard that you can save money switching insurance companies every few years, but never actually shopped around until now. found $1,715 in annual savings!. i stayed with the same insurance company for auto since 2007. i added my wife to the policy when we got married in 2013, and then added a policy for our home in 2014. i noticed that the premiums were always trending up, as though there was no benefit for being a loyal customer. i finally put in the effort to shop around and found better deals for the exact same or better coverage.

i'm not sure if it's against the rules to post the names of the companies or not so i left them out. after finding the potential for savings i posted to local social media asking ""anyone have any good or bad experience with claims from company b?"" and am waiting for some feedback before i move my policies over. that said, i'm sad i didn't look into this sooner, and look forward to getting into this habit every 3-5 years.",11

her income potential is roughly $30k-$40k/yr and will never go up probably

also, we have no savings or 401k. i make 130k/yr and we live paycheck to paycheck because we are retardedly financially irresponsible....and somehow are able to waste that money without buying luxury goods, drugs, or gambling...

"i'm 18 and i will be homeless soon. please help.. i'm an 18 year old guy and soon to be homeless. to preface:
i've been living with my mom who has mental issues and was basically a ticking time bomb. today we had a small argument and she suddenly went absolutely insane. i'm going to spare the details but if you were to listen to the breakdown from outside you'd think someone was being murdered. her breakdown is over but she says ""she's done with everything"" and is leaving the apartment so that the rent will not be paid. we'll likely soon be evicted anyway because of the damage to the apartment.
so that's the situation. i need advice on how to get through this... for reference:

i have no money for at least a week. we have always been extremely poor, living paycheck to paycheck and often that wasn't even enough, etc. my mom (when she was being normal) told me to quit my job last year and focus on school, so i did.

but, i did get a job this week to pay for school transportation, but since i just started i barely have any weekly hours and my paycheck is at least a week away. but i'd like some tips on what to do once i get it.

i'm enrolled in a massage therapy school and i have a student loan taken out for it, so leaving is not an option. but everyone is very nice there so i can probably ask for some help there on monday.

i've seen others like me come here in a crisis. if you know any subreddits i should x-post this to please let me know, i'll be checking my notifications as i pack my stuff.

i typed this up fast so i'm sorry if some things aren't clear, i'll reorganize this later. thank you for reading.

edit 1: thanks to everyone who has advised me so far. unless there's a better idea or a reason not to, it's looking like joining the military is the best choice for me. i've got no family, and my friends don't even live on their own yet. my new job is not giving me nearly enough work hours to live off of. i don't have much wiggle room, unless i can convince my boss to give a brand new guy full time hours. if there's any advice about this choice you can offer, please do.

edit 2: wow, a ton of people are dropping advice. thank you so much. please give me some time to respond to the comments and messages. bless you all

edit 3: i spoke to my landlord and he's giving me some time to get on my feet. he told me he'd call in 6 weeks to see what my plan is. so i have a little time.

additionally i've formally decided to join the air force (and quit massage school). i took the practice asvab and got a great score so to all the people pming me worried about me dying in the military --  don't worry, i will probably have more flexibility in my placement than you think. i'll make a final update when i have my start date, so again thank you to everyone in this thread who provided advice.",11
"ordered something online, ups delivered to wrong address, package was refused, company wont refund me even though it wasn't my fault and it's being returned within their time frame of allowing returns. can i refute the charge on my card?. i live in the us, ordered a moderately expensive item from a company in china and it was delivered to the wrong address and refused. after talking to ups they said it was the company's fault because they put the address on the label weird and ups cant do anything about turning the package back around and getting it to me.

i have contacted the company multiple times and they haven't done anything but tell me to contact ups and have ignored my requests for a refund. can i just refute the charge on my credit card and get my refund that way since i will have never actually gotten the product?

"old bastard here. the biggest 'out of left field' change i have witnessed is i have to negotiate a better price every year for household bills like electricity and car insurance. 30 years ago i would just pay them without question.. car insurance came in. they dropped the renewal by 15% just because i said i wanted to look elsewhere.  

it is a freaken game. the whole 'i need to see the manager' bull for authorisation to lower the quote.  

years ago i would have felt bad. now it is routine to ask for a better price.

edit 3 hours in. thanks for the great replies everyone. i'll do my best to get some upvotes back at you.

"for years i paid interest on maxed out ccs. after paying them off, i challenged myself to make the money back from the banks. this year i earned $2000 worth of cc rewards while raising my credit score from 590 to 715.. i understand cc rewards and credit scores are not the cornerstones of personal finance. but this one is personal: 

as a freshman in college, i found out my parents took out credit cards in my name and maxed them out. it was a shit show. however, while they did something terrible i understand their reasons (survival -- they were hopeless). this left me with $3,000 dollars of credit card debt. during undergrad and grad school, i could never pay these off and kept sending $50 to the banks each month just to keep them from going delinquent. sometimes, i missed payments.

in another post, i explained how after grad school i was able to pay off all my debt and raise my score from 590 to 705 in half a year(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/54qsmw/this_summer_i_paid_off_all_my_cc_debt_raised_my/). hallelujah! 

so i started doing what i always wanted to do: use credit cards responsibly. moreover, **i was on a mission to earn the money back that i had to pay in interest all those years.** i closed most of my old cards as they also had annual fees and no perks but kept my discover card. i was able to upgrade it to discover it immediately and start earning a percentage back. i was surprised only a couple months later when i got a pre-selected letter for the citi double cash back card. i signed on. i also became an avid fan of nerdwallet(https://www.nerdwallet.com) reviews and other blogs about the best rewards cards and how to use them wisely.

here's the breakdown of my crusade:
-----------

discover it(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/discover-it) ------------------------- $147 -- % back.

chase freedom(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/)	--------------------$313 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

chase saphire prefered(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/) ------------$600 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

citi double cash(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/citibank-double-cash-card) --------------------$350 -- 2% back on everything. this is my catch-all card.

hilton honors(https://www.valuepenguin.com/hilton-hhonors-credit-card) -----------------------$400 -- value of 80k points(https://thepointsguy.com/2017/06/june-2017-monthly-valuations/). signup bonus.

bank of amer cash rewards(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/bank-of-america-bankamericard-cash-rewards-visa-signature) ------ $150 -- signup bonus after spending $500. 

amazon store card ------------------$40 -- signup bonus. i wanted to pre-order destiny 2, sue me. 

chase banking account -------------$200 -- this wasn't a cc but i got $200 for moving to a chase account. 

-------------

so that's where i stand right now. it's important to note that i always pay my credit cards in full each month. and while i know my credit score could be higher if i was letting my average credit history grow, i'm happy with it in the 700s at the moment. i imagine soon i'll end this crusade and cancel the sign-up bonus cards. at that time, i'll cozy up to my double cash card and spend a life together.

-------------

**edit**

1. i've gotten some messages that i'm likely just letting my spending creep up to meet these goals. this is *absolutely* something people should try to avoid. personally, i track my monthly spending for each category and set goals of what i want to spend in each per month before looking for ccs. this helps me avoid spending more just to make a reward bonus.

2. bank bonuses! i forgot to mention i switched to a new bank for a $200 credit. haven't spent a dime there either, just needed to set up a direct deposit with chase.

**tl;dr** i spent years in cc debt due to my parent's fuck up. i paid them all off finally a year ago and have comitted to being a wise cc user. without increasing my spending, i started taking advantage of every cc signup bonus, cc % back, or checking account signup bonuses i could to get that money back.

"teachers and students can download microsoft educator 365 and get all microsoft office programs for free, as opposed to the typical $99.99/year subscription price!. i wasn't sure what the best sub to post this in would be, but i wanted to get the word out! my wife is a teacher and is required to have microsoft office on her laptop. we bought her a new laptop for the school year and, while at best buy, the salesman was telling us that the only way to get office was through the yearly subscription. i thought that didn't sound right, so i decided to do some digging. sure enough, if you go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office and have a valid school email address you can get microsoft office free, for the duration of your schooling or teaching career!

"credit employee at mattress firm offered to check our credit, got our info and signed us up for a credit card without our permission. currently fighting the bank to fix. went shopping for mattresses, and the employee offered to check and see what we would be approved for if we decided to finance.  we agreed, and the employee took down a lot of information (ssn, address, dob, income, etc).  he came back and said we were approved for something around $7800 in financing.

we ended up leaving and going to a different store.  a few weeks later, credit karma reports a 50 point hit on our credit.  then a day or two after that we get a letter from synchrony bank giving us our two new credit cards.  that we never signed for or agreed to.

i called the bank immediately, cancelled the account, and explained multiple times that we did not sign up for this account, and that we were misled.  we only agreed to checking to see what we could get approved for, not for actually getting a card.  the rep on the phone was helpful, and got the request submitted.

fast-forward to a month later, and i get this letter:

"if you use alexa, make sure ""she"" didn't subscribe you to amazonmusic unlimited without your knowledge!. i noticed i had a charge on my card for amazonmusic unlimited. i reached out to amazon and they said the subscription was activated by my alexa enabled device in the kitchen - no one in my house would have done this since we have a family pandora premium plan. the amazon rep told me if you request a song thats part of unlimited, it may subscribe you. this is crazy - check your accounts just in case. also, you can change the default music service for alexa i just found out - so that's my next step. 
they gave me a full refund and cancelled the subscription by the way.

edit: hi all! i haven't had time to read through all the comments, however there may be some questions about small children activating it etc.
it's just me and my wife in my household, no small children or any other guests within the last month when it was activated. my wife and i definitely didn't knowingly accept or ask for it, but we may have accidentally done it??

edit 2: ok a couple more updates for all the questions and such. mystery solved! i listened to the recording (all my alexa interactions are recorded apparently) and it was my wife's sarcastic ""ok"" that did it. no i didn't call and ""chew"" out anyone at amazon - i've worked my share at call centers so i'm not that guy - they knew i didn't want the subscription and refunded it right away - this was more of a psa for people who weren't aware - but most of you are; good! 
what did i learn: turn off voice purchasing!! thanks everyone for the tips and help.",11
"another lesson in ""do not sign till you sleep on it."". my 2001 subaru forester that i love dearly just had the clutch replaced last month. driving home from the mall on sunday, i was passing a big new and used car lot and i heard ""pop!"" from my motor and lost all power. i coasted the subaru into a parking spot at the car lot, and called the partner to come get me. 

while i'm waiting, i was approached by a salesman who reminded me that a 2001 car is 16 years old. he showed me a kia that was similar in shape and size to my subaru. the price on the windshield was just over $10,000. 

the husband showed up, diagnosed the subaru as a busted timing belt, and got into the conversation with the salesman on the kia. i hemmed and hawed, we did the math, yes i could afford it, but going $10,000 in debt was not what i had planned for a sunday afternoon. my down payment was going to have to wait for my bank to open on monday anyway. i got the guy's card, took pics of the vin # on the kia, and headed to the husband's car.

at the last minute, the credit manager runs out the door and puts a piece of paper in front of me. he says ""60 months at $178 and you drive away in this kia tonight."" i said ""why would i sign something without having slept on it? i'll be back tomorrow with my down payment."" 

i went home and did the math on his offer and discovered that he didn't calculate my down payment. i was not happy about the offer at all. i read some low reviews on that make and model of kia. then i read some shitty history on the vin search about that particular car. still, however, i had no car to drive, and i need to commute from the 'burbs to the city every day.

the next morning, before the bank opened, i called my mechanic and asked him ""what do you think about this model kia?"" his response was ""what happened to your subaru?"" i told him that my partner diagnosed the timing belt issue. he said ""that's a $500 fix. the valves don't get bent on that motor. tow it over here."" for another $200 he's going to replace the windshield that picked up a crack recently. plus the tow bill, the whole thing is less than $800. less than the down-payment i was going to pull out of savings. 

so now have my old subaru back, i'm not $10,000 in debt, i don't need full coverage insurance because there's no loan on it, and someone else can buy that pos kia. dodged that bullet.

don't ever sign anything that big without sleeping on it. 

edit: i will trust my mechanic long before i will trust a stranger's advice on the internet, so you can stop telling me how stupid or wrong he is. 
edit 2: i also admit that i left some info out of this post, such as my history in the auto insurance industry, which means i know cars and i know insurance. 
edit 3: the point is not that i kept the subaru; the point is that i did not buy the kia. read for comprehension, not for response. ",11

"received a job offer with the lowest pay option and was told to call back with a counter offer. no idea what i'm doing.. i received a job offer out of college as a system support engineer with a company in my area. the pay scale started at $x and i was offered $x. the scale increases by experience. i have worked in a similar job through college for 1.25 years, and it should qualify as this experience is a main reason the new company hired me.

"friend declined pay raise because he'd ""make less money"".. a friend of mine recently declined a pay raise because he believes that the higher income would somehow result in him making less money due to taxes. i didn't get into too much details with him, but he mentioned this is a result of earned income tax credit. i know the us tax system is based on marginal rates and there's no way you can ""earned less by making more"", but is there any validity to his thinking? is there any way you can loss money by earning more or vice-versa?

edit: thank you all for your thoughts and opinions. all of you were very helpful. i think i may suggest that my friend speak to a tax professional or a cpa. i agree with (most) of you that an increase in income likely won't negatively affect him.

edit2: okay here's what i learned today, and i hope some of you don't have the same thoughts as my friend; 

1. you can't lose money from taxes by making more (marginal tax system). 

2. you can't lose money from earned income credits by making more. the system decreases from a max at a rate of $0.07 per $1.00 earned. 


3. you don't lose money by working ot. ot is taxed at the same as regular wages.your company is probably calculating your tax withholding wrong. 

4. it takes a very unique situation that is heavily dependent on government benefits to ""lose money by making more"". if you think this is happening you should consult a tax expert.",11
"if you or a loved one is harmed or killed by someone's negligence, don't donate money to insurance companies by foregoing your claim.. i work in insurance defense and i rub shoulders with many insurance adjusters. i am shocked by how many people tell the insurance company they do not plan to make a claim after a loved one has been killed by a negligent driver or property owner.

before deciding not to make a claim against someone, understand that you are literally just donating money to an insurance company. if you are understandably uncomfortable with receiving money because of a loved one's death, make the claim and donate the money to a cause your loved one cared about. 

edit: i also want to point out that if you are partially at fault, we take that into account before making you an offer. so don't think, ""well, i was partially at fault too so i'll just swallow up all the costs."" if you are partially at fault, we will only offer you an amount proportional to the insured's fault. and in the extremely unlikely event it goes to trial, the jury will be instructed to do the same.",11

"changing companies is worthwhile even while in a low level position.. i'm basically just a stock boy. but i've been doing it for three years now. my old job was cutting my hours and i really couldn't afford to just stay there. 


i spent over a month trying to find a second part time job with little success. until i decided to apply for a new full time job with some competitors. it meant giving up on having two jobs and getting more than 40hrs a week, but no one wanted to give me a part time job with the odd hours stockers have to work. 


i got a call from one store within an hour of applying. and took a job from a different store that did the entire hiring process over the phone in one day because they didn't want to wait and have someone else make an offer before i could come in for an in person interview. 


now i'm making about 20% more, getting full time hours, and possibly most important of all will have health insurance (something my old job didn't provide).


i was surprised how in demand someone with experience can be, even in a low level position. although if your job is anything like mine you've had to put up with an endless stream of shitty new hires who couldn't do a job even as easy as stocking. so it makes sense why managers and hr are excited to see what should be a sure thing applying. 


this subreddit is full of information that has no use in my current financial situation. but i encourage everyone to look around at your other options. even if you don't have a degree or certification or a real carrier. companies are always hiring for low level positions, and some of them are willing to pay more to not have to train someone or worry about them not being capable of the job. 



tldr: if a stocker can get a 20% raise by changing companies you should at least give it a shot. 



also i'm on mobile and i always see people apologize for that with formatting so hopefully this doesn't look crappy. 
and i don't think i'm breaking the rules by posting a success story. the details of my own experiences are just there to help anyone else in a similar position realize this applies to them as well. i've seen plenty of posts about changing companies that i didn't feel like applied to me, so i tried to make a post that would've gotten me to explore my own options sooner.

"i love ally. they helped me out managing my shutdown finances.. i'm scrambling to deal with unexpected loss of income during the shutdown. i had $25k in an ally cd as my emergency fund . . .  i'd gambled last year that i wouldn't need the funds soon and locked them up in a 12-month cd, thinking that i could break it open and take the 60-day interest penalty if an emergency came up. 

enter the shutdown. usually i'd be ok for awhile, but i'd just made a large purchase in november that needed some belt tightening and budgeting. i hadn't budgeted for a complete loss of income. it wasn't dire, but i needed to pull the first parachute cord and liquidate the cd.

i called ally and got david from the arizona call center on the phone and asked about the penalty and told him about my shutdown situation. he said ""wait on hold a minute if you would"" and he took the situation up to his supervisor who waived the penalty and also refunded a couple of overdraft fees i'd incurred in this mess.

i've read your stories about wf being cold as shit to people impacted by the shutdown. i'm super grateful to ally for their help during a stressful time. david, if you read this, thanks a bunch! a really professional and kind operation.

throughout the rest of the night, this debit card made an alarming number of purchases to the point where i filed identity theft complaints and froze my credit (per the instructions on this sub), and transferred all of the money out of my checking account. spoke with folks at the bank again, they told me, again, that it was clear that my identity was stolen and that they'd have a specialist call me during business hours. 

spoke with specialist today and, apparently, someone else with my exact name asked for a new debit card on their account and they were given a debit card to my account. the bank person gave someone access to my account because of a ""human error."" 

received an apology email from the branch manager today saying that this never happens and that they had closed the other debit card and returned all of my money. they would also use this experience as a training exercise for future employees. 

this seems crazy to me. is there anything else that i should be doing? should i just accept the apology?

tl;dr person with same name gets debit card to my account. ",11
"experian site can give anyone your credit freeze pin. https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/

two days i posted how effective are credit freezes in actually preventing identity theft?(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/70wt2j/how_effective_are_credit_freezes_in_actually/). it got virtually no attention, and i was disappointed, because it's an important question.

a credit freeze will not 100% prevent identity theft. pin's, like ssns, can only be so secure. this discovery on the experian site is proof of it.

while a freeze will certainly will make things more difficult for hackers, it is not 100% a guarantee of protection.",11
"always, always check that your employer is actually paying you what they said they would.. this may seem like common sense to most, but i'm posting in case it helps even one person not make the mistake i did.

in august of last year, i was offered a promotion, full time, and a 3$/hr raise at my current job (a small b2b software company). i'm a new graduate so this was my first ""grown up"" job with benefits. i accepted and just assumed the pay raise would be reflected september 1st since my boss, his boss, and hr had all signed off on paperwork saying it would be. full time hours did hit and there was more money in my account...my timecard only shows hours, not rate, so i just assumed all was well. 


well, my fiance and i were combining budgets, and his hourly rate is the same as mine should be...but somehow, he was making a lot more? i checked with hr and it turns out, due to a paperwork error they never increased my pay. i've been receiving my old rate the past 7 months. i feel like an idiot! but, i'm going to get back pay to the tune of $3,000+ plus the incentive i was offered on start up and never actually received. 

so, don't be me. check that your company is actually paying you what they said they would, and never, ever assume when it comes to your paycheck. :)

"lyft charged me $100 for vomiting in the car. as shaggy famously said ""it wasn't me"". saturday i was out with buddies, went bar hopping. one of the lyft drivers filed a cleaning fee for $100 for vomiting in their car. don't get me wrong we were all drunk but we can all remember that ride and no one threw up. i filed a dispute, they responded back saying too bad driver provided proof (picture of the side of the car). now, im not sure if i should let my cc company deal with it or respond by saying ""i'm not arguing that there is throw up on her car, i'm arguing it wasn't us"". how should i handle this situation? i'm not trying to pull a fast one on the driver, if one of us threw up i would totally pay but it wasnt me.

update : 

i found the pictures.. can seem to upload them to the post.. help lol is it to late to post a picture with my post?

update 2:

 i tried to look at the data, i can't seem to find any useful information. any wizards out there willing to help? these are the images lyft sent me via email. 


update 3:

they responded saying they reviewed the evidence again and they won't be issuing a refund. (i wrote back before posting to reddit)

this time i was less friendly and asked what evidence they reviewed, for the original pictures, picture of the car before the damages, location and time of pictures. i mentioned other news articles of scams like this. i told them if i was not refunded  i would reach out to my cc (so i will get money anyways) (i have capital one btw cause idk if this is true lol) , post on all social media about their ""investigations"". i also asked for an invoice of the cleaning service. any thoughts? something i forgot to add? 

i will update once i have a response.

"don't ever feel pressured (young people especially) to spend more then you have to or want.. i'm 23 and graduated last year and was offered a full time position making decent money out of school. i've come to notice that ever since taking the job a lot of my peers constantly hint that i should be spending every dime i make on a new car, clothes, going out every weekend etc. at first i was pretty bad since i live alone am lucky enough to debt free and don't have any obligations outside of monthly bills which leaves me with decent amount of wiggle room. i'm usually left with around 500$ every month and instead of investing/saving i would spend most of that 500$ for the first while.  i've come to realize there's better places to put my money.

i've noticed that a lot of people my age have very short sighted goals when it comes to money. instead of taking that extra cash every month and investing in retirement, emergency fund etc. we tend to blow it on useless crap that we think will get us notoriety among our peers. there's probably a lot to blame for this mind set (social media etc etc.) that i won't get in to. not saying every millennial does this but it's something i've noticed through my friends, and just in general.

i'm definitely not saying don't treat yourself every once and while but 100$ a month spent on stuff you probably don't need versus 100$ a month in a savings or retirement account can go a long way. don't let peer pressure make you look back and wish you saved more!

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of great replies. i just want to stress that this isn't some attempt to make people feel bad for spending or try and say every young person has it the same. i am also not trying to demonize anyone i'm just talking from my perspective and my experiences for people who may be in the same boat or find themselves in a similar situation. especially in today's world where materialism is more and more prominent with social media you'd be crazy to not think that ""peer pressure"" i talk about isn't there even if its not directly stated by people around you.

"a tip for those of us that eat takeout on consistent basis.. a couple of months ago i was looking at my bank statements and each month i was spending about $200 on eating out. the first piece of advice i see when someone wants to pay off their debt is to cut back on expenses. eating out seems to be the main offender. 

i decided to take a different approach. every time i wanted to order take out, i took the amount of what my order would be and placed it into my savings. in the past couple of months i've saved a little under $200. this included everything from fancy burger places to dollar pizza. even little things like going to the store across the street to buy a can of soda. watching my savings grow has been really motivating me to cook at home more and stay away from junk food. i used to eat takeout at least twice a week and now i'm down to once or twice a month because of it.

---

edit: so i'm getting a lot of mixed feedback here and some are very valid. note that this is not something that works for everyone as everyone is under different circumstances but i do find that this works for a lot of people. this isn't a catch all by any means. for those of you calling it stupid, while thats your personal opinion, remember that different techniques work for different people. if eating takeout is more beneficial to you then that's great. this post is for those that want to save money but eat out regularly. personally, i think its helpful to see things on paper.

additionally i never said to stop eating out entirely. i understand the necessities of enjoying one's self for their mental and emotional well being. i will eat out every now and then especially if it's a special occasion. i'm talking about those of us who eat out multiple times a week. 

there are benefits to each, its just a matter of picking what's most important and sensible for you. 

to those that are saying that they don't want to eat boring/bland food learn how to use spices and herbs properly. ",11
"don't buy textbooks at college/university. after completing my 4 year degree, i purchased 4 books in semester one. i realised throughout the semester that i'd used the books maybe 3-4 times (typical student). the cost of the books, $300, didn't seem feasible. 
i looked into other avenues and found that the library has most books available for short (3-7 day loan). you can also scan a certain number of pages (i think it could be 10% - i'm in australia - check this to ensure you aren't doing it illegally) and just scan the select few you need at the time. i did this successfully throughout my degree and found it rather easy and no major effort at all!

by doing this, i spent approximately $50-100 for my remaining 7 semesters. in comparison, my colleagues spent $2500-3000 for the same educative experience.

for those books that you absolutely need, either borrow from a friend, or buy second hand. you can save hundreds, if not thousands this way also!

tl;dr - books expensive. borrow from library. paid $300 buying books sem 1. spent $50-100 for remaining 7 semesters through borrowing/scanning pages i needed (see above for legal issues - unsure if countries have different laws). colleagues spent $2500-3000 over the four years in comparison.",11
"the atlantic: two major credit ratings agencies have been lying to consumers. *a cfpb investigation concluded that transunion and equifax deceived americans about the reports they provided and the fees they charged.*  

*in their investigation, the bureau found that the two agencies had been misrepresenting the scores provided to consumers, telling them that the score reports they received were the same reports that lenders and businesses received, when, in fact, they were not. the investigation also found problems with the way the agencies advertised their products, using promotions that suggested that their credit reports were either free or cost only $1. according to the cfpb the agencies did not properly disclose that after a trial of seven to 30 days, individuals would be enrolled in a full-price subscription, which could total $16 or more per month. the bureau also found equifax to be in violation of the fair credit reporting act, which states that the agencies must provide one free report every 12 months made available at a central site. before viewing their free report, consumers were forced to view advertisements for equifax, which is prohibited by law.*

"i am being charged $400 for a person i don't know who claimed me as her guarantor.. so a few months back, my sister asked me to be her guarantor. i agreed. when i logged into the portal to sign the contract, i noticed she had also added me as the guarantor for one of her random ass friends she wanted to room with. after explaining to her how incredibly fucking stupid and unacceptable that was, i emphatically refused to sign her friend's contract. later, the apartments called me about the missing signature and i explained the situation and again refused to sign. 




fast forward to a few weeks ago, i get a bill in the mail from a debt collection agency. this is where i fucked up: i assumed i'd never hear from the other girl again, so i thought my sister was behind on her rent. she showed me proof that she wasn't so i figured they had sent this earlier, but that my sister had since paid. 



turns out the girl was being charged for a no show on her contract and they are treating me as the guarantor. neither the debt collection agency nor the apartments can show me documentation proving that anything was signed by me. but the debt collectors want an email from the apartments to clear me from the account. the apartments swear up and down that i signed, but somehow can't provide me with any proof.




according to the debt collector, it's been over 30 days, so if they don't get an email from the apartments within 48 hours, it'll affect my credit. i have zero expectation that the girl would pay it even if i could get in touch with her.



what can i do? how can i put pressure on the apartments to send that email? ",11
"$450,000 in debt. medical school grad with no job.. hello everyone. throwaway account here, hoping i can get some valuable advice regarding the situation i'm in...

i'm 29 y/o, recently graduated from medical school 2 years ago with $450,000 in student loans from both undergrad college and med school. 

now the way becoming a ""working"" physician in the us works is you apply once a year during september, interview for a couple months, then find out whether or not you got any job the following march. this is called being ""matched"" into a job called medical residency where you work as a junior doctor physician for 3 years inside a hospital and then you get to apply for a real doctor job thereafter. 

unfortunately for me, i did not match into residency twice in a row. i am honestly a below average student (low grades). upon requesting feedback from the people and directors that interviewed me, they said i was qualified, interviewed well, but my initial board scores although passing was just below average compared to everyone else. 

i decided to reapply for the next year's cycle.. during that time, i worked as an er scribe for minimum wage and unfortunately could not save up as i was living paycheck to paycheck while paying application fees, interview costs (flights, hotel, car rentals), etc. in regard to my student loans, i applied for repaye and qualified for $0/month on my loans, but am still accruing an insane amount of interest each day. 

fast forward a year, i ended up again not ""matching"" into a residency job again. at this point, i've almost completely given up and am seeking alternative career paths, but my parents convinced me to apply one last time. i moved back home (different state) to save on rent, sold pretty much most of my belongings, and am now unemployed. at this time i am studying for another medical board exam test that if i pass will hopefully show these hospitals that i may be qualified for their program. most of my friends and family say that with the half million dollar debt i am in, i have no choice but to work as a physician and keep trying to land a residency job as a junior doctor... with that said, i really don't know what to do now, financially speaking. i can keep reapplying year after year but then my loans would just keep increasing. to even make a dent on them, i would have to pay over $900 a month just to cover interest costs before even scratching the actual loan borrowed. i don't even have the money to pay for the application fees and another years worth of travel expenses so much of the costs will be unfortunately covered by my parents. i feel like a huge financial burden to them and even with their help, i am not sure how i will pay for the other expenses for this year's cycle while trying to pay back the interest on my loans.

the application season starts this september. my exam is next month in august. i will try to find a local clinical job nearby after to acquire any income, but i'm further concerned that i will never really get out of this debt and/or never become a working licensed physician. thank you for reading, i know i probably went all over the place so if i can clarify anything, let me know.

tl;dr $450,000 student loan debt. medical doctor degree with no job. living with parents.

update 1: oh wow, thanks for all the advice folks, i really appreciate your time. so a bit more info, i applied internal medicine during the first cycle, then family and internal med during second cycle. i graduated from a foreign medical school which i don't think i can disclose at this time. i think that the military route isn't open for foreign medical graduates even though i'm a us citizen. based on these replies, if the 3rd match cycle doesn't work out, i'll attempt to transition into a government job with pslf since that really is my only other option. with that said, i hope i didn't dissuade anyone from wanting to enter the medical field based on the situation i'm in. the majority of us-medical students match into a residency and have no problem so i believe they will be okay.

update 3/11/19: by the graces of god, i matched into residency. thanks for all of your support.

"if you can afford it, pay a little bit extra to get a lot of extra protection regarding car insurance.. my husband was rear ended in a car accident this week. at the scene, the at-fault driver presented an insurance card showing coverage through may. we thought everything would work out fine. 

as the week progressed, however, our insurance agent updated us on the truth behind the other driver. as it turns out, he was arrested after we left the scene. he had a warrant out for his arrest regarding a previous hit and run, he was driving on a suspended license, and the car wasn't his. the car belonged to his girlfriend, who had let the insurance lapse. we had been hit by an uninsured motorist. our car was totaled and my husband was accruing medical bills. for a few anxious moments, we thought we were looking at huge out of pocket expenses with little chance for reimbursement, given the character of the other driver and the fact that he was currently in jail. 

thankfully, we pay an extra $11.10 every 6 months as part of our insurance premium for uninsured motorist coverage. by opting into this additional coverage, we saved ourselves from the stress and impossibility of suing the other driver personally to be reimbursed for our damages. instead, our insurance will write us a check for our totaled car and pay our medical bills, and they will be the ones suing the other driver, not us. 

all for an extra $23 a year. 

edit: i'm being told that this reads like an ad, but i guarantee it isn't. i am a writer by profession, which might explain the tone of my narrative. plus, this happened on tuesday so it is all still very emotional and fresh in my mind. i'm very happy that this post has motivated people to learn more about their own policies and insurance coverage. 

edit 2: our cars are insured in oregon, so those are the state laws / minimums that apply to our situation. 

edit 3: also make sure your car seats are properly installed, and if a car seat is in the car when you're in an accident, know that you most likely need to replace it! car seats lose their effectiveness after a collision. we included our car seat in our claim and we will be reimbursed for a new one.

i called and spoke to a cs rep for the hospital and simply asked to work out a payment plan. she said i could pay a monthly amount for a year or pay in full right now and get a 20% discount! i was ready to leap out of my chair but thankfully composed myself and said, while i appreciate that offer is it possible you could do more. she said that is the most she could offer without manager approval. i asked if she would ask her manager. after a minute hold she came back with 30%!!!

i've been most successful the couple of times when i was able to lead crews or manage people but i either had to move for personal reasons or quit the job because they wanted me to move around too much. my current employer has made it very clear that once hired here i'm my department (industrial mechanic) there is no room for growth. that the only potential i have here is to be the best mechanic i can be. i'm not ok with that.

i really want to get away from manual labor and start anywhere really i just want the potential for a well payed position to be available to me provided i work hard and make intelligent decisions along the way. i see all the guys i work with now and they're beaten down, stressed and you can tell the years of this have been rough on them. i don't want to be that guy. i also workout a lot in my free time it's kind of my passion  and these physically demanding jobs really take away from that. i guess what i'm looking for is suggestions on where to start looking. i'm currently taking home $2,800 usd a month after taxes, 401k, insurance and all the other deductions. it's not a lot by any means but i've gotten comfortable with it. my previous jobs were closer to $2000 so i like making that little extra. 

ideally i'd like to be taking home 4k a month within the next 5 years but i can't do that here and i don't think i can within this industry. i would appreciate some advice on where i could start looking.

however, when we broached salary she stated there would be a ""adjustment,"" but wouldn't give specifics. i'm pretty certain she wanted me to commit to it before i even knew the salary. 

i told her i felt like i was worth high $60s, which is approximately 10% less than than the person in that role (which i quietly found out beforehand). i mentioned that i had a similar job offer from another company for around $60k that i turned down. and we'd be saving $13k on my replacement. so all in all should be at least $10k savings. but she wants to base it on a % bump from my current much lower salary, rather than what the job actually should pay. 

she instantly quit talking, almost like she felt betrayed by even asking for a higher salary. it's been awkward around the office for the 48 hours since.

"amazon seller fraudulently used my husband's ssn and now the irs wants us to pay taxes on income they generated selling.. we got a letter from the irs stating they had adjusted a previous year's tax return to reflect an amount of adjusted income reported and we now owed a huge amount of taxes and penalties.  this shocked us as we each have a single job and certainly no additional income on the side, much less enough to generate a tax burden in the tens of thousands. a couple phone calls revealed that my husband's ssn was fraudulently used in association with an amazon seller account that generated enough income to require tens of thousands in income tax owed.  we never sold a thing on amazon so this is an obvious case of identity theft / fraud.  so far the irs and amazon have not been exceedingly helpful and it seems the onus is all ours.  we'll take the obvious steps one should take when a victim of identity theft, but im curious if anyone has dealt with this before.  amazon is so prolific i can't imagine this hasn't happened before.

"$65k+, hate my life vs. $45k, happier. currently work in an exceptionally high pressure field as a manager and frontline customer service personal. very time sensitive and strict line of work with many different and demanding ""bosses""(customers, insurance partners, actual bosses) to appease. 

my workplace is a 70km round trip commute(which i loathe). i am essential personal and expected to man my post regardless of weather conditions or conflicts/complications in my personal life. in 10 years i have missed less than 10 days of work. 

monday to friday i leave my house at 6:30am and do not return until 6:30pm or later. frequently i am working beyond that, 12-14hrs a day if the work volume so demands. i often remote connect to my work conputer from home on the weekends and evenings. the workload is overwhealming as i am the only person in my workplace who handles the type of work i do. every customer, and every phonecall is more piled on to an already overflowing plate. 

generally speaking, i have a strong distain for my workplace, customers and employer. i feel totally burned out and complacent.

that being said, i have a salary of $65k+ with benefits, which from my limited perspective is pretty good.

i have an offer to move to a large multinational insurance company. the office is a 4km commute from my home, the hours are 8-4 and the workload would be a fraction of whats currently demanded of me. the only hang up im having is the $20k+ pay decrease i would face.

base salary for the position would be $42.5k with an increase to $45k(plus pension and benefits) after 6 months.

i know for my mental health the change would be a good thing, but i am so hung up about the salary disparity. 

i truely feel like a wage slave.

could anyone ring in with an outside perspective to aid in clearing my mind?

thanks pf community.

"some helpful information regarding medical insurance - based on 25 years experience. i worked for a blue cross affiliate for nearly three decades and frequently see questions here about medical insurance. i wanted to share some helpful tips about some common roadblocks people run into.

firstly, medical insurance has many,  many policies in place, but you have to ask for them.

* you visit the er and are seen  by an out of network doctor. you are shocked when the statement comes in and you have to pay much more than you expect. similarly, you have surgery with an in-network surgeon, but surprise surprise, the anesthesia doctor is out of network and the claim gets applied to your much larger, out of network deductible. this is known by many names - surprise billing, raps (radiologist/anesthesiologist/pathologists). if this happens do you, don't panic. call the number on your insurance card and explain to the rep that this particular scenario was out of your control and you are requesting that they process the claim under your in-network benefits. 99/100 times, they will agree and your share will hopefully be reduced significantly

* an offshoot of the above - if you are treated by a ""surprise"" provider, and your insurance does process the claim under your in-network benefits, you may find that the doctor bills you more than expected. for example - radiologist bills cigna $1000. they ""approve"" $500, pay 80% of that $500, and state that you share is 20% of that $500 ($100). but the bill comes and they are billing you your $100 share, plus the other $500 that the insurance ""ignored'. this is called ""balance bill"". and again, if you call your insurance and explain that this was out of your control ,and the doctor is not kind enough to accept the reduced rate that insurance calculated, 99/100 times they will recalculate the claim to approve the full $1000, and then assign the 20% as your share (or whatever your benefits happen to be).

* a big complaint around here is having some test, service or procedure that ends up not being covered by the plan. it could be because the plan simply does not cover it (cosmetic procedure), or perhaps they deem it experimental. so how are you supposed to know? every single blood test, scan, surgery, poke, and prod is assigned a unique five digit code known as a cpt code. they bill that code, along with other codes that describe your medical state. those are known as diagnosis codes. 99/100 times, a decide to either pay or deny a claim is based on a policy that involves looking at the combination of cpt and diagnosis code to determine if that is a covered service. that means that before you have anything done, you can ask the provider for those codes, then contact your insurance by email to get confirmation that those codes, when billed together, are covered. i say by email, so that you have it in writing if there is a problem down the road. there are *some* cpt codes that have very rare coverage, so even with a diagnosis code, they may not be able to definitively say yes or  no. in those cases, the doctor can send them your full medical records and ask for a pre-determination. basically saying, if we were to bill you a claim with these codes, and this medical history, would you pay or deny. they will send a response letter letting you know.

* pricing is all over the place. if you are lucky to have a plan that just charges copays for everything, this does not really apply to you. but if you are like most people and have a large deductible, the negotiated rate for a specific service can make a huge difference. if you need an mri, there could be 5 in-network facilities in your area and the range of negotiated rates can run from $450 for a private, mri facility, to $4500 for large university hospital. you can call your insurance with the cpt code for the test you are having and ask them to supply you with the negotiated rates for a few facilities in your area. many insurers now offer this pricing tool when you log into your insurers website.

* many insurers are recognizing that keeping customers happy is good for business. they are starting to create programs to erase the old image that insurance companies just want to deny everything. for example, aetna has a program that (**if** you ask,) will reprocess a claim to an out of network provider, to your in-network benefits, once per year. see this link for a full description of the program: https://www.crnstone.com/news/service-without-borders/

* you have appeal rights. depending on your plan, you can have 2-3 attempts to appeal, so even if you are not lucky the first time around, you can try again. after you have used up all attempts, many plans let you ask for an external review, where a 3rd party reviews everything and makes a non biased decision. by the way, since you have a fixed number of appeal rights, usually 1-3, make sure each one counts. don't call up cigna and say ""i dont agree with this copay, i want to appeal"". you just wasted an appeal because what exactly did you give them to review other than your dissatisfaction?

i will try  to answer any other questions that pop up regarding medical insurance so feel free to post here. 


**edit** - i am so glad this has gotten popular. i really hope this advice can help someone. a few more tips:

* i cannot say enough good things about goodrx. run your prescriptions and compare prices. firstly, you will see that there can be a huge range of prices between cvs, walgreens, walmart etc. also, you may find a price that is even lower than your insurance company's negotiated rate. if the difference is large enough, it may make sense to just use the coupon, instead of your insurance. the only downside is that you won't get credit towards your deductible. but saving a large amount of money may be worth it.

* always, always check with your insurance to make sure a particular doctor is in-network *at the particular location, with the particular tax id#*. i cannot count how many times someone got screwed over because a doctor was in-network but they saw him at a location that was not. and never rely on the doctor's office to know the details about *your* plan. they manage 3,000 patients accross 25 different plans. and doctor's office are more than glad to tell you ""we take your insurance*. what that can often mean is ""sure, we will physically **take** your insurance card and bill them, but are we in-network? absolutely not!""",11
"my husband and i are idiots. we've been bamboozled by a financial advisor.. ugh i'm so frustrated. i thought we were doing a good thing for ourselves but now i think we are trapped.

full backstory: a friend recommended their ""financial advisor"" to us. we thought ""great! we've been meaning to meet with someone... we have a kid on the way and husband isn't putting away anything towards retirement since starting his new job in august"". 

so we set up phone meeting with his friend from northwestern mutual. she gives us a call, and we end up speaking with her for over an hour. she asks us lots of questions- what we are looking for (we tell her we want to set up retirement stuff for husband and explore maybe putting some of our 17k in savings into cd's or mutual funds). she asks us questions about when we see ourselves retiring, how ""aggressive"" we are, etc. all good stuff. we hang up and agree to talk again in a week when she will give us a plan.

cut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me the plan. it's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  but she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. ""sure"" we think. maybe we do need more life insurance. she explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and i need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). this is news to us but we hear her out. she also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. again, we think ""maybe we do"". so we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. she briefly mentions we should be maxing out my roth ira and we could perhaps start one for husband. so we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.

over the next week, husband and i really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term). but we were ok maxing out my roth at $450/month. we also wanted to explore stocks/bonds/cd's/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). so i sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. she sends back ""ok, great! sounds good.. talk soon"".

cut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated plan. she emails us the new plan while we are on the phone. literally nothing is changed. she proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. husband and i are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. i mean, she's the professional, we thought. i still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. she kept giving me the guilt trip on ""what will your kids have if one of you dies!"". by the end of the conversation, i hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my roth to northwestern. she had me give her my bank routing info to get ""the paperwork started"". she also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. we could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. ""ugh fine"" i think. she says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure ""the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my roth"".

so a week or two goes by. and i see a ~$30 charge go through for ""disability insurance"". which i told her i didn't want!! and i just realize... this doesn't feel good. it doesn't seem right. she's not listening to what we want. she still hasn't addressed out interest in cd/mutual funds/stocks that we initially came to her for. i spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r/personalfinance, nerdwallet, just googling in general about what husband and i should really be doing. i decide to call the whole thing off with northwestern.

it's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. i was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts ""we really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. again, thank you"". 

she is being evasive and manipulative. telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. at this point i have just ignored any further communication. it has just been a really bad experience. 


but the real reason i still feel like i can't completely ignore her, is that i asked her several times when i should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance that i did not want and did not agree to. she just dances around the question. i'm also worried because i have gotten a ""bill"" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term and $170 in short term disability. 

is there anything i can do to make sure i don't get charged this? if i communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc. 

what do we do. she is being shady af.  ",11
"over a year after it was disclosed, the experian site will still give your credit freeze pin to anyone that knows your ssn and dob. i froze my credit after the equifax breach, but have had to lift it a few times since then.  when freezes became free i wanted to confirm that my credit was frozen with each bureau.  when i got to the experian site, i went through the process of adding a new freeze, and when it asked for a pin i put in the existing pin i had.  the confirmation page said something along the lines of ""you already have a freeze, and the pin is 123456"".

i was slightly worried and so repeated the process in a new incognito browser window and when it asked if i wanted to enter a pin or have them generate one i let them generate it.  i got the same confirmation/error page with my current pin displayed.  to be clear, the second time i did this, all i provided was name, address, ssn, and dob.  i did not provide the pin.  i did have to answer some of those security questions you tend to have to answer when confirming your identity online (eg, ""what bank is your home mortgage with?""), but the entire point of the credit freeze is to prevent people who may have that type of information from opening new credit.

i wanted to warn people, that while the credit freeze is a still a good idea, it's not iron clad.  it would also be nice if there was some pressure on experian to change this.  i googled to see if this was already documented, and was shocked to see this article from over a year ago outlining the exact same process working the same way.

"you will never get paid what your work is valued at unless you ask (i'm a business owner). i have read many posts on here about people complaining that they're aren't paid enough, just found out they aren't paid as well as others at their company, or are verbally told they are getting a raise but never get it in writing.

i own a business and employ over 50 people. i can tell you straight up that payroll is my biggest controllable expense and if i can pay someone less and stay in business, i am going to try that. i also know that if i don't pay enough, i will lose high quality staff. it's a juggling act. how much can i pay so they feel like i'm paying them well while trying to hold back enough money to pay the bills and save some money for a rainy day? it's different with every hire. if someone asks for a raise, they better show me why they deserve it. i'll also weigh that decision with the marketplace and how easily i can replace them. some jobs aren't meant to make much, others should make more. 

i pay my staff well enough that i experience low turnover. i have competitors who don't. i chose this as part of my business model. it works for me but not everyone.

if you want a raise, ask for it, but realize you're taking a risk of being told no. give clear reasons why. have a back up plan in place if you don't get what you want. get it in writing.

and if you think you should be making more then interview and take that new job, because odds are, you won't get the kind of pay increase you're looking for unless you leave.",11
"another driver hit my car. their insurance won't pay or return my calls.. as the title states, my parked car was hit by a guy backing out of his driveway at the end of september. right after the accident, i called the police, got an accident report, and the other driver admitted fault. i submitted a claim with his insurance, got a letter stating my claim was in process...and i haven't been able to get anything else from them since. i have spoken to their higher ups, left hundreds of messages, and nothing happens. no updates, no one who answers will give me any information, nothing.

i think i am at the point where i need to file with my insurance to get my car fixed, but i wanted to see if there are any other steps i can or should take. is getting money from the other driver's shitty insurance company a lost cause? will my insurance go after them? do i get a lawyer involved?

thanks in advance everyone.

update: thanks for taking the time to give me advice everyone. i just filed with my insurance company to get this going.

update: great feedback, reddit. thanks for all taking time to reply. this was my first accident and i feel like i am now much more prepared to handle this. for others like me, go ahead and file with your own insurance, especially if the offending party's insurance is unresponsive. there is no good faith with these people, even with a straight forward accident with a police report. this should be illegal, but it isn't. my insurance has already scheduled repairs at the body shop of my choice and is going after the other party/company. i will check my rates but have been assured they won't go up as i wasn't at fault or even in the vehicle. again, thanks everyone. you people are great.",11
"i just got fired: the importance of savings. hey guys.

i was literally fired less than hour ago, and this subreddit is the first ""person"" i'm telling.

i just want to point out how incredibly important savings are. i am 24, and this was my first real job. i am fortunate to have saved $5,000 in savings (enough for about 4 to 5 months expenses) and that isnt even considering unemployment and my last check. 

this is a huge reason why i didn't cry when i was fired lol. it didn't feel like my livlihood was gone.

"never hurts to ask. put in my notice, got a 10k raise.. so brother in law has brain cancer and has about 2-5 yrs to live but won't be able to work.  his motor skills havr taken a step back.  my sister is in mri tech school full time and they have 3 kids.  the family is stepping up to help, but the hospital bills, and daycare, etc. is mounting.
i am helping her out, but i began looking for a better paying job to help out even more.  i want the kids to have food, clothes, bithdays, and be as normal as possible.  
had some interviews and got an offer for 10k more than my current job.  i accepted.  
the company i work for is doing so so and budget is tight, so i never even thought of asking for more money.
went to turn in my notice and the director asked if he matched would i stay.  i was baffled, but of course i would.
he got the match, i will be able to send more to my sister, and i don't have to start a new job with a weird shift.
he also had many words of praise about my work and said although budget is tight they want to keep the good people.
made my day, weekend, month.
lesson learned on asking for a raise.  it never hurts to try.

edit:  wow!  a ton of great stories, encouragment, and opinions.  thank you all?
a little more background.  i did get an offer letter for the raise.
the cio brought me in to her office and said she normally never saves people from leaving for the very reasons many of you have expressed (if more money comes they will leave eventually anyways), but they love work and my attitude and it was a no-brainer for her.  
some of you may say she is just saying that, and you could be right, but we had a heart to heart and talked about people we had lost and people we know who currently have a terminal illness.
will i retire from here?  no.  i am a gen xer(35) and like to move jobs every 2-3 years to keep things fresh.
does their gesture make me want to more for them? yes.
i am in it, and live in mn.  it jobs are everywhere and pay well.  they know this yet gave the raise anyways.

edit 2:  
thanks for all the support.  lots of good conversation from those in the same boat.  some have been burned, others had it worked out for them.  i hope to be in the latter group and feel that i am.  time will tell.
as for my brother in law and sister, it's a long road ahead.  the guy is so young (39). embrace every moment folks. tell everyone you care about that you care about them.  go on adventures.  live life.  become a vikings fan!

"$0.00 bill sent to collections, they added $15 ""interest"". this is a follow-up of sorts to my previous post where i thought everything had been resolved(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7hqaen/employer_recently_changed_providers_and_i/).

in yesterday's mail i received a collection notice from grant mercantile agency (is id'ing them by name okay? i'll remove their name if mods disapprove) showing a principal amount of $0.00, because i'd paid the bill in full in june, but with interest of $15.38. so the collection agency is claiming i ***currently*** owe them $15.38. (""because of interest and other charges that may vary from day to day, the amount due on the day you pay may be greater."")

i immediately called the radiology center where i'd paid the bill in june but their a/r people had already left for the day, so i got a/r's direct number and am planning to call them this morning.

i'm hoping a/r will call the collection agency (ca) and tell them to knock it off.

but it's also entirely possible that this is something i may need to do myself.

so, that's the question.

if i do have to call the ca myself and **if** they're ***not*** willing to acknowledge that this is clearly a computer error and just zero out the account, how do i fight this? what do i tell them? *other* than ""fuck off, you shady cunts"". because that would not only *not* be polite but counterproductive as well.

and i'm certainly **not** paying interest on a bill that i've already paid in full.

***update:***  i just spoke to a/r, told them the ca was charging me $15 interest on a $0.00 bill, and they agreed that that's not right. they're going to send me a $0.00 statement, and said they will also contact the ca to let them know the account has been settled. i guess i'll have to wait to see if the ca is willing to play ball, or if they'll still try to get a slice of my pie.

***2nd update:*** a couple of hours have passed and i decided to call the ca myself. with all the bad rep cas get, the lady i spoke to was very polite, friendly, nice, etc. she looked up my account, told me it had been zeroed out, and that i did not owe them a penny. she also assured me that the debt had ***not*** been reported to the credit reporting agencies, then reassured me a second time that it would not be. yes, she actually said it twice, that it ***has not*** been reported and ***will not*** be reported to them.

due to the security snafu with experian we have their ""pro"" service for a year (or however long it is) so when i get home tonight i should be able to pull my credit report with them for free, regardless of the ""one free report per year"" caveat.",11
"hr pulled me to demand proof of a degree i never claimed to have, (they knew i only had a hs diploma) and now they want to cut my pay.. my hr at the company i work for contacted me telling me they did an internal audit and found i have no proof of degree on file for my position that 'requires a degree'. that's true because i never got my degree and said as much on my application and in my interview, in fact during my orientation they asked if i could provide a copy of my degree to which i said i have none just a hs diploma and they said that would suffice. all has been good for 3 years.

well now they're changing tune and want to reduce my pay by $5/hr. the kicker is, there are others within my dept that don't have degrees and they didn't get audited so their pay remains unchanged.

i know an employer can reduce pay whenever and for whatever reason they want. my question is can they do it using a reason such as not having a degree but applying that condition selectively and allowing others to be untouched, and can they fire me with cause if i don't accept the pay cut that happens to only target me?

any help would greatly be appreciated as i've scoured google to not much avail.

"update my mom didn't pay taxes. the state is going to take money from the joint account she opened for me when i was a minor that only i use. can i do anything?. my original post is here!(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4k66ag/my_mom_didnt_pay_taxes_the_state_is_going_to_take/).

as a reminder, unbeknownst to me, my mom didn't pay her taxes so the bank sent me a notice that the tax board was about to take money from our joint account, which is really my account that she never ever uses, and her name is only on it because it was opened when i was a minor (although i no longer am a minor).

good news!  i ended up calling the tax board several times, and they were actually extremely helpful once i got a hold of a real live person.  in the end, they had me fax them my information, a pay stub, and 3 bank statements from the last three months, proving that i was the only one who used the account.  afterwards,  they removed the order to levy my account.

i have since withdrawn the money from that account and put it into my own account.  problem solved. 

thank you for everyone's help and advice on this.  

edit: for those who are wondering, my mom will be ok.  i talked to her and convinced her to face her taxes rather than continue to put it off.  she was very very sorry.  she started a payment plan june 1 with the tax board.  whether she follows it and stays with it is up to her. ",11
"verizon applied neighbor's significantly past due debts to my account. my current 2 year contract was about to expire so i called verizon to change it.  i was told i could not change a thing because there was a credit hold on my account.  i am a 30 year customer with a perfect payment record so i was shocked when i was told i owe verizon more than $2,000.  it took a 2+ hour phone call, multiple transfers and several 3 way conversations, until one customer service rep took charge and refused to give up.  this customer service rep, after multiple tries, finally found  someone in the verizon credit department who was willing to listen to common sense and correct my account.  my townhouse community's addresses are similar to apartment buildings,  one overall street address per court then each townhome is assigned a unique unit number.  my neighbor has the same ""common"" first name as me and the first 3 letters of our last names match (only 3 out of 9 for me).  the credit department rep told me that verizon's fraud monitoring system used this minor name similarity to automatically assign my neighbor's outstanding accounts to me.  it did not matter that my neighbor's outstanding accounts had different full last names, account numbers, unit numbers, phone numbers, ssn, etc. my fear is at the end of the conversation the credit department rep. said this could easily happen again because a ""computer"" did the initial assignment.  my questions are.  is this even legal?  is there anything i can do and/or anyone i can contact to prevent this from happening again?

&#x200b;

**update:**   to answer some questions i am receiving and what suggestions i took so far

i did check my credit report while on hold and it was ok.  i plan to keep a good eye on it now.

verizon used to be bell atlantic which provided copper wire phone service so that is why i have been a customer for 30 years.

i was lucking that ssn's were required because the credit representative asked for my last four numbers as final proof that the other accounts were not mine.  they had a different ssn.

thanks to a link provided in the comments i emailed what happened to two senior executives.  i got an auto reply from one saying they just retired and use this link for making contact.  i went to that page and filled out an on-line form sending it to another senior executive.  i doubt i will get a response but will update this post if i do.

in both the email and online form i highly commended the csr who was determined to get my account fixed.

&#x200b;

**update 2**:  i'm shocked,  a person from verizon's executive relations office called me and left me a message saying they are so sorry for what happened to me.  they were happy a csr did finally help me and they will be notifying their manager about my positive feedback and compensation.  finally they left a phone number and asked me to call them back tomorrow so they can talk to me about my experience.  i will update this post again after this phone call.  personally,  i give verizon credit for responding to my email so quickly.

&#x200b;

**update 3**,  before i report on my conversation with the ""executive csr"", i wanted to add more detail on what happened, i think it is relevant now.

i called verizon support to update my plan that was about to expire.  the initial csr began to make the changes i wanted then told me they could not because i had a credit hold on my account.  i asked why, i always paid my bills but the csr had no idea.    this csr then contacted the credit department and we had a 3 way conference call.  the credit rep. was no help at all, she said i could not change anything on my account and i could have my services cut because of the amount of money i owe.   i told her that i have never seen these charges on my account, on-line and never received a bill for them.  she did not care.   then whenever i tried to ask a question  she kept repeating i had only 3 choices, pay the money, contact the billing office or something else (i forgot what this was).  i kept asking her where did these charges come from but she would only respond with those 3 choices.  i asked her to review my account and i kept getting the same response.  then she accused me of not listening to her and interrupting her.  finally i got so frustrated i had the csr forward me to the billing department.  while on hold with the billing department i got cut off.  i called back and finally got someone from the billing department.  this person could not help me but then conferenced in a gentleman from some department who would at least answer my questions on what the charges were.  he gave me the account numbers, the amounts, the years (2003 and 2012) and the address associated with the accounts.  but neither the billing rep. or this gentleman could remove my credit hold.  i was then transferred to the fraud department.  the fraud department asked if i had my identity stolen and if i thought my neighbor did this to me and i said no.  then they said they could not help me because it was not fraud.  i was again transferred back to billing who could still not help me so i was transferred back to a new csr.  this csr listened to me,  looked up all the accounts, and immediately said it was common sense that i was not responsible for these charges.  he said he could clear this up quickly but was unfortunately over optimistic.  he then called the credit department and got the same credit rep. i originally talked to, she gave him the same answers she gave me previously and refused to help.    then the csr got his supervisor involved and that did not help,  then i think he even went higher up the management chain trying to figure out how to help me.  the csr kept assuring me he will get this solved but was obviously getting frustrated.  then he and his managers decided to call the credit department back hoping they would get someone else other then the rep. we previously dealt with.  luckily he did and again i was involved in a 3 way conference call.  this credit rep asked me a few questions and the final one was, what is the last four of my ssn.  once i said it i was finally believed and the credit hold was removed.  but that is when i was told this could happened again and the first credit rep was just following company policies and procedures.

&#x200b;

**my conversation with the executive customer service representative:**

i got another apology and was again told that the csr's manager was notified about my compliments.    my case will be sent to the fraud department for review but she could not assure me that this would not happen again.  she said  that what happened to me was very rare.  i did not agree with this but i said what really bothered me about this whole situation was i was treated like i was automatically guilty of fraud and if the initial credit rep. just looked at the accounts and used common sense this could of been cleared up quickly.   i was told they have standard policies and procedures that must be followed.

i then explained in detail everything that occurred, which i explained above.  none of this seemed to matter.

i then asked if this hold could affect my credit reports and was told no because they only report to credit bureaus when accounts are closed,  this reporting is done by ssn, and the outstanding accounts had different ssns.

i then asked if what happened could be added to my account and was told it could not be added directly to my main account but was added to my credit account,  but i said since the credit department was the department that was the least helpful and they found me guilty immediately, i do not have any confidence they would help me in the future if this happened again.  i then got the standard answer they have policies and procedures they have to follow.

i then asked her to send me an email documenting everything she said and asked if i could contact her directly if this happened again and i was told no for both requests. i would have to follow verizon's standard policies and procedures and call the normal customer service line initially.  and at one point during the conversation she began to imply that the csr who finally helped me could of done better if they followed their standard policies and procedures.  in no way did i believe this and i did not want to get this csr in any trouble so that is when i moved to end this conversation.  basically, this conversation only made me more angry.

**my next step**:  i really like verizon's services, i previously had both direct tv and comcast and i never want to go back to them.  this was the first time in 30 years i ever had any issue with verizon, even though i was not very unhappy with what happened,  i plan to stay with verizon for now but keep all my documentation, emails and continue to check my credit reports periodically.

**finally**:  i was shocked this went viral, sorry for the length of this update, and i want to thank everyone for your assistance.

**wait....the executive customer service representative just called me back:**  she was just notified that the fraud department has permanently disassociated my account with 3 other outstanding accounts.  it looks like there was even another account on top of the two i knew about.  i asked for an email documenting this and was told yes.  i did get the email

"near the limit on your credit card? if you can afford the minimum payment this month, make the same payment next month, not the new minimum payment.. **just as an example, if you have:** 

- a $5,000 balance on a credit card 

- with a 20% interest rate, then

- paying just the minimum (let's say 3% of the balance, which is $150 for the first payment), 

- **it would take 183 months (that's 14 years) to pay off the card, and you'd pay $5,601.51 in interest alone.**

*this is because the minimum payment goes downs as the balance goes down.*  this is what the banks are hoping you will do!!

so after making the first payment of $150, your next minimum payment is $148, then $146 in month 3, etc.

**but, if you just keep a constant payment of $150, you'll pay off the card in 48 months and spend $2,164 in interest.**

**this will shave over 11 years off the time it takes to repay the card, and save you $3,437.51 in interest.**

*paying even a small amount over the minimum payment each month goes a long way.*

more examples:

paying $175/month ($25 extra) cuts your payments down to 39 months and saves you $3,914.51 in interest.

paying $200/month ($50 extra) cuts your payments down to 32 months and saves you $4,226.51 in interest.

**i know you hear this time and again here in pf, but paying the minimum payments is a lifetime debt sentence.**

*and paying extra each month gives you an emotional ""win"" that will help you keep moving forward.*

**edit #1:**
**of course, in a perfect world, no one would carry a balance on their credit cards, and would only use them to get cash back rewards and travel points and airline miles and a date with olivia munn**, but this post is geared towards people who are facing high balances already, and to show them that you can make serious progress by implementing one or two good strategies.

**edit #2:** 
wow, i definitely did not think this post would jennifer garner any attention. (get it?! she's a shill for capital one's venture card! **""what's in your wallet?""**  nevermind.)

**edit #3:**
thanks to everyone who upvoted, and especially to those who responded.  someone sent me a screenshot that this was on the reddit front page last night, which i definitely didn't see coming since there isn't a video of a cat singing ""you've got a friend in me"" to a baby sloth anywhere in this thread. but seriously, this will brighten your day(https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5pv7tj/dad_and_4yearold_daughter_duet_youve_got_a_friend/).

**i can't emphasize enough (and i know it's stickied right below this post), how important it is to read 
""how to handle $""(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)**

**95% of what the average person needs to know is right there on that page.**
and while a lot of it seems like common knowledge (as dozens of you have pointed out), for some people who were never guided properly in how to handle their financial life - it just isn't.
in my opinion, just like personal relationships, personal finance is a very complex issue that often has rather simple solutions - you just have to see them, and then make the effort.
*let's try to keep supporting each other - and reserve judgment whenever we can*.  ***you don't know what other people are going through***, and comments like, ""u r all dumb i pay my cards every month and if u don't u need a brain transplant"" aren't helping anyone.

this is only one of many strategies that can be used to tackle debt, and it is only an example.  in order to draw up the example, i had to pick some numbers, such as the balance, the apr, and the minimum payment %.  this example is actually not nearly as heinous as many credit cards out there, which have minimum payments that are much lower than 3%, and all but trap you in a cycle of paying *just enough* to keep you card right near the limit.

in those examples 14 years looks like no time at all.

here are the online calculators i used to find these numbers:

minimum payment calculator(http://www.creditcards.com/calculators/minimum-payment.php)

snowball calculator(http://www.whatsthecost.com/snowball.aspx)

i encourage you to plug in your numbers and see how they change based on different payments.",11
"just discovered my credit card's ""cash back"" program. is it really just free money? i find it too good to be true.. i was paying my credit card bill online and i found a link on the bank of america website said i had unredeemed cash rewards, several hundred dollars. i had never noticed this before. it gave me a few options for how to redeem it, it said they could send me a personal check in the mail or i could deposit this money directly into my savings account with the bank. it says i get 1% cash back for every purchase i make, and 2-3% for certain purchases.

is this really how it works? i get paid a small bonus every time i spend money using my credit card? and it's just free money no strings attached? 

i was always taught if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. i suppose it's not that much money, because i think these hundreds of dollars were earned over like five years since i first got this credit card. still, what's the angle here?

"psa: your doctor does not know what is not covered. do not rely on them for billing questions.. i work for a medical group and we see this quite a bit.  the physician will say one thing and then the patient finds out that it isn't covered and health insurance nightmares quickly ensue. 

your physician is not familiar with your insurance plan and what they may or may not cover.  they have a pretty good idea but when it comes down to healthcare and non-price transparent services please always use caution.  you will be the one paying not them.

there are several ways to go about this.  #1, which your physicians office sometimes will do, is get a pre-certification or a pre-authorization.  this is basically them calling the insurance and saying we're going to do x and we want to know it's covered.  insurance will give them some sort of documentation and then you can generally expect that service to be covered.  

 #2 you can call your insurance company and inquire.  please be advised this is not full proof and they will not hold their people responsible for telling you the wrong thing.  please default to #1 above if in doubt.

for our medicare patients; if you ever get an abn or advanced beneficiary notice they are telling you that whatever you are doing or having done is not covered.  please be aware of this.  

i hope this helps as i have been seeing more of these issues.",11
"i have about $70k of debt from my training/education and i just got hired and will be receiving a $44k signing bonus. is it smart to immediately put that entire bonus towards my debt?. it seems logical to me to get this debt off of my back as quickly as possible so that i can start to save/invest my money, but of course i could be wrong about that.

"am i insane for thinking about taking 3-4 unpaid months off to travel?. background: 25 years old, living in the northeast us. recently paid off $50k in student loans and now completely debt free. around $75k saved for retirement and $10k liquid.

i'm thinking about leaving my current stressful but well-paid job at a tech company in a few months and finding an opportunity abroad on workaway or helpx. the plan would be to work on a farm or in a hostel abroad (europe or south america) for a couple months then returning to the states to dive back in with another company. 

my expenses would be around $1000/mo during this period but i wouldn't be able to save as aggressively as i have been doing. still, i think it would be an extremely fulfilling experience. i currently rent so i'd do this at the end of my lease, don't have a car to unload, and have been trimming down on possessions so i could easily keep my belongings with family while i'm away. i'm also a dual citizen (us/nl) and could legally work in europe for this period.

is this something that's worth pursuing or just reckless? has anyone here has experience doing something similar?

**edit:** just want to say thank you to those who have added their thoughts here. was not expecting this kind of response or consensus when i posted. it's easy to lose perspective in a career track where competition and profits are #1 above all else. it's so, so helpful to get input from a group of people with all kinds of experiences and goals to help me find my way a little more clearly.

"almost got duped by a crafty scam, wanted to share to prevent others from falling for it.. i was in las vegas this past weekend and stayed at a no-name hotel slightly off the strip to save some cash.  it had good reviews and was basic, but was clean and got the job done.

sunday morning at 10:30 my hotel phone rings and it's the manager letting me know their computer system is down at the moment.  check out is at 11am so we were already packing and getting ready to leave despite our hangovers.

he let's me know that because the system is down they're a few hours behind on recovering data.  he confirmed my room number and offered me an extended checkout (which sounded great from the hangover) and also offered to comp our least expensive night's stay for the inconvenience.

he mentioned there were 30+ people in the checkout line and offered to check me out via the phone and said i could leave my keys as i left.  he asked me to confirm my credit card number and i got a little hesitant and said i would feel more comfortable providing that in person.

he got a little defensive and reiterated who he was and why he was trying to save time.  i still declined and went down to the front desk.  turns out, it was a scam and they were randomly dialing hotel rooms to get cc numbers and personal info.

they were super accommodating with their offer and because my hotel phone didn't have a caller id, it was very convincing.  stay safe out there and never be afraid to say no until you know who you're sharing you're information with!

tl:dr - someone called my hotel room pretending to be the manager and said their system was down and wanted my info including credit card to confirm and reimburse me for the trouble.  was a total scam and tough to trace, be careful!",11

"in case you have a small car accident and the person at fault refuses all contact. tl;dr it is possible your state's insurance commission can help get things moving with an insurance agency whose client is refusing contact.

a woman bumped into my 1-year-old honda van at a stoplight. the screw head on her front license plate made a neat if disconcerting hexagonal-shaped hole in the plastic bumper, otherwise the resulting scrape might not have been anything to have repaired. but i didn't want a hole in my bumper.

we exchanged information. based on anectdotal evidence from past experience, i didn't call the police for this extremely minor problem. i still think i was right not to bother them with it.

i had the bumper looked at; it was going to cost $500-$800 to take the bumper off, repair the hole, paint the bumper, and put it back on. and i would need to leave the van with them 2-3 days, since paint had to dry, etc.

i told the woman who hit me, and offered to let her pay for it instead of involving the insurance company; i didn't care which way she did this, and believe that her premiums would almost certainly go up at least the amount of the repair. she said she didn't have $800, and that she would get in touch with her insurance company.

i didn't hear anything for a week or so, tried to call her back, got no answer. tried from my home phone (which number she did not have) and she did answer, sounded disconcerted to realize it was me, said she had contacted her insurance company, they would be getting in touch.

waited a few more days; she did not answer calls from either number, and did not return messages.

i called my insurance company; they said my insurance would cover it if i cared to make a claim there, but that i could also just open a claim with her insurance company. so i called and did that; the person i talked with said they had no record of the accident, took the information, and said they would contact her and get back in touch.

another week; the insurance company says they have not been able to get in touch with the insured.

another week and a half, same thing. either something catastrophic has happened to her or she's avoiding talking with both the insurance company and me. i asked the insurance company what they intended to do about it, they said they have to talk to their insured before they can do anything. how convenient.

my wife suggests i talk to the state insurance commission; in nc, where we are, this is a state agency that regulates the insurance companies here. so i called and explained what was going on; they said they couldn't help much in terms of getting things moving unless 30 days passed from the time i opened the claim without any action on their part. there is a regulation, you see, that they have to respond to the claim in 30 days.

so at 30 days + 1 i call the commission again to let them know the insurance company took my claim over 30 days previous and has not offered any information, let alone resolution, since then. the next morning, the insurance company called (was it my imagination they were being much more solicitous?) and said they were accepting responsibility, let's set up an appointment with one of our adjusters, etc. appointment was made and kept, damage assessed, check cut, all within a few days. i could have gotten a rental as well, but had access to a car to borrow and decided against it.

i'm sorry for this woman who drifted into my car and doesn't have $800; i could have been much more accomodating if she had just worked with me. but i wanted pf to know that state agencies can be a help when it seems the normal commercial methods of things break down.

edit/addendum: why i didn't file with my own insurance. in my experience (i've lived in nc almost all my life), any claim made through your insurance company allows them to raise your rates. it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to be your fault, it doesn't have to be substantial. i did call my insurance company for advice (after being told i couldn't talk to my agent, this company wants people to talk with them directly), and was told that of course i could file a claim, they would take care of everything and then contact the other insurance company to get reimbursed. but when i asked whether this would raise my rates, they couldn't tell me. it is, according to them, not *possible* to inform me whether this or any other action will raise my rates. this fact alone made me disinclined to deal with them over something this minor, since it leaves it entirely up to them whether to raise my rates, and there will likely be nothing i can do about it.

edit/addendum: why i had it repaired. there is certainly a little vanity involved. we buy cars new and drive them until the costs of their repairs makes it economical to buy another. so our other car is a 2003 camry with over 200k, and i hope to drive it a while longer yet. yes, the hole in the bumper is a small thing, but it is a thing, i don't know whether rainwater would get in it or what it would do if it did, i didn't cause the damn hole, i wanted it fixed. i don't think this has anything to do with high insurance rates, except to the extent that it costs so much to fix, which is not my fault. insurance companies don't charge based on what things cost them, they charge based on what they can get away with. that's why they're so rich.

edit/addendum: why i didn't call the police. i thought at the time that there was a minimum amount for which one is required to call the police; i personally think that, if you aren't required to and there's no other reason to, that they have more important things to do. i've looked up that info since, and there seems to be a requirement to call if the damage is more than $1000. i don't know how lay people are supposed to judge that, given that this repair was estimated at $500-$800 and actually came in for about $500.",11
"couple of tips that went a long way for me, financially.. so i was in the shower, pondering life's mysteries and throwing out some comebacks to my school bullies 4 years too late, when i began to start thinking about the positive changes i've made financially. they saved my ass a couple of times, and so i wanted to share. 

i. the saving accounts. 

- get a saving account with interest. period. i use discover for a cashback debit and a savings account. shop around for one that best suits you.

- some people still don't know you can have more than one dedicated savings account. if you don't know, now you know. you can get creative with these hoes, too. i had one dedicated to 3x rent, utilities, and groceries. 
i say have a minimum of 2x, but if you can add more, add more. 

- i had another one dedicated to emergencies. i have $4.5k in there. this covers car problems, anything my insurance doesn't cover, hotels, food... you get the idea. much like everything else, your goal will and should depend on your financial situation. again, add more if you can. always. 

- if you can, have a ""fun times"" account. 
i, at my core, am a materialistic motherfucker. i love watches, cars, clothes...everything. but, i refrain from living like one, because i've developed discipline over the years. however, i'm also in a position where i can throw in money into a more ""flexible"" account like this, so i do. this gets last priority. if i have any money left after r/u/g and my emergency account, then i'll throw it in this guy. 

ii. the talk. 

*you* know *you.* and sometimes, you just have to get real with yourself. 

when i see that lego set, i'm telling myself ""you lazy motherfucker, you're not going to spend your time building that."" 

and when i see that beautiful solar g shock that can be submerged for 17 years at 50000 meters, i think ""but when's the last time you actually went outside?"" 

think things over. find reviews. imagine yourself using it. then repeat the process. i sit on purchases for months sometimes before actually going through with the purchase. sometimes, by the time i'm ready to buy whatever it is, there's a nice discount on it. other times, they raise the price and i just repeat the process again. it happens. 

iii. eating out is your enemy. 

as i grow older, i find that most of that ""fun time"" money is going towards eating out. the money is fair game, so financially, it's fine. but mentally? imagine the toll. postmates and grubhub are cancer. it's convienent. too convienent. and the additional fees are outrageous. 

do yourself a favour. go to the grocery store more often. buy shit you'll actually want to eat. buy what you crave. live a little.  remember, it's fun money. not grocery money. 
$20 of food from the store would have satisfied me more than  $20 of delivery fees from postmates.

and that's it. budgeting can suck at first and can be hard depending on what your situation is. i just wanted to share some points and tips that might help the average guy out. 



edit: firstly, thank you for the gold, stranger. 

secondly, i wasn't expecting this to blow up, but i'm glad i was able to make some points that resonated with people! 

also wanted to note that i'm an amateur when it comes to saving and budgeting. this post wasn't intended to go into the realm of investing, 401k, etc. not to say you shouldn't! there's plenty of people that have recommended investing, and that have also given some tips on where to start. 

thanks, y'all. ",11
