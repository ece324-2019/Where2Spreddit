"i did it.. 7 years ago, when i was 24, my wife was killed in a horrible car accident, leaving me (in complete shock and grief) as a single father to our 2 kids (at the time they were 1 and 3 years old). i didn't have any post high school education and was working as a construction worker. before my wife passed away, we both worked full time and were able to rent a small but nice house. but as a single working parent, i could hardly make ends meet and had to move in to a tiny apartment. that christmas, when i didn't have enough money left over to get my kids the gifts they deserved, i really knew i had to do something. i started taking college classes at night while working 2 jobs, and after five long years, i graduated with a bs in mechanical engineering and got a job making 6 figures. i bought a nice house with a huge yard for my kids to play in, built them a treehouse, and have enough time off to spend plenty of time with them. last week, i took them on a camping trip in the mountains. it's not until now that i really let myself believe that i actually did it.

edit: thank you so much to everybody! i'm very overwhelmed by all the replies. i will try to answer as many as possible.",12
"i was having lunch with my friends for my birthday, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, everyone had left.... there was a small moment where i thought 'that's okay, they're busy and i really appreciate that they came and had lunch'. that was when i noticed the package with my name on it sitting on my chair. inside was a ransom note, a blacklight, and some random puzzle pieces. what followed was a four hour epic journey around the city, solving puzzles. this included a trip into a bar where the bartender said 'i've been expecting you', and handed me another set of locked boxes and puzzles as he poured me a whisky. eventually  it finished at some accommodation they had booked for the weekend, along with the final address of a bar where everyone was waiting for me. they designed everything themselves. i was so utterly overwhelmed and humbled by the extraordinary effort they went to for me. these people are funny, smart, kind, and generous and i always feel lucky that i know them at all, let alone get to call them my friends. the world is a much better place for having them in it. 

edit: i have been utterly remiss in telling you all how happy and stoked i am for how much you all liked the story of my delightful friends. i showed my said peeps who couldn't quite believe that anyone would think they were that interesting. ergo, thank you! my friends are your friends so should you need us, just shout.",12
"the 8 year old girl next door just broke my heart. some backstory:

i'm a 24 year old guy, i love tooling around on old cars, something i've done together with my dad since i was a kid, he was all too happy to have me carry it on.

so i work your typical 8 to 4-5 schedule, and quite often i'm in the garage after work fixing up this old mustang i've been on for the last two years or so. (a completely unrestored '65 mustang that my dad has had for years, to take on now that i'm out in the world, that was a special moment). 

so one day, i started leaving the garage door open, and its to the front so pretty much everyone can see what i'm doing, people stop by, chat, say hello, its great, i always love to chat it up, especially older folks that are happy to see a young guy getting his hands dirty working hard on a classic. 

so about a year ago during the summer, the neighbors mom asked if i could look after their little girl rachel, a quiet little girl that always seemed well behaved. i didn't mind, but i said i'm really committed to working on this car, if you feel good enough to let her over here while i'm working on the car, not a problem. 

turns out they're going through a divorce, the dad works the 3rd shift, the mom's got a part time gig, evening hours just aren't good for em. ok, so this starts, and it goes fine. she's quiet, usually reading books or watching the tv i brought out so she would be around me. i always made sure to be courteous, firm, and try out dad humor every now and then. well, she starts to come out of her shell after a while and it was a joy.

i still remember when she first asked about why i was working on the car:

""why are you working on that car when you have one thats newer and works?""

""well, this car is about 45 years older than the other one, its a classic. she'll be much prettier when i'm done with her. i've been sitting in the garage helping my pop since i was younger than you! i always wanted to be like him and so i'd sit and learn and eventually he let me help.""

""oh. whenever i see dad he's always sleeping.""

""well, he's working hard to provide for you, he's working a tough job."" 

she just kind of was quiet after that. but after two or three months, she started being cheerful when she came over, always asking questions about what i was doing specifically. this part and that, why it needed to be done, what made it work. i was glad to impart knowledge, i think everyone likes teaching a bit, especially something you're passionate about. 

i started teaching her about tools, how to recognize which ones you need, what they can do on a car or around the house. she started to light up, i got the sense that besides school.. she didn't have much of a parental figure. or anyone to teach her anything about life, or anything. 

one time my dad visited in his '66 gt convertible, and i took her for a ride in it. 

i'll always remember how she smiled, saying, ""is this what yours is going to be like?"" 

""should be, but mines a coupe so it won't be quite as nice.""

""nooo, yours will be much better! cause we've been doing it!""

my chin started to wobble and i just smiled and said you're right, it will be. 

she'd really started to grow on me, i mean, it would be impossible not to let her into your heart. a bright eyed smart little girl that just soaks up everything you teach her, wants to learn, and looks up to you like that.

it made me sad, because the times i saw her parents interact they were always snide or yelling at each other, when they were around that is. this spring i started noticing the mother leaving without a uniform, sometimes dressed to go out. i came to the conclusion she quit or wasn't working, but still taking advantage of me babysitting. which i didn't mind in the slightest. 

sometimes rachel would be quiet more when she came over, but i always waited until she would open up. she'd let out tidbits like, ""mommy woke me up late at night, she was acting funny."" or, ""she came home with someone that wasn't daddy"" or the like. it would pierce my heart, but i didn't know what to do except keep being a safe harbor for her of sorts. she started hugging me more often, squeezing me as hard as she could. i'd always get a lump in my throat. 

she's just wormed her way into my heart, how when i take a break and sit down, she'll climb all over me until i give her the proper attention, every now and then when she does some mannerism or phrase she picked up from me.. even just when i ask her to hand me a tool and she picks the proper one no problem.

we had some of the best times i can remember, just tinkering under my car, her with a raggedy old sweater of mine on with safety glasses so old dirt wouldn't fall in her eyes, watching me work, asking away. one time she nicked herself on the edge of the radiator support and i picked her up and went to bandage it up. 

i told her, ""most girls your age would cry if they got that little cut."" 

she said brightly, ""now my hands are gonna get all beat up like yours!""

i didn't even know what to say so i burst out laughing (plus another lump in the throat) and hugged her and said, ""you're the best little girl in the world you know that?"" 

then a few weeks ago, her mom came over and said they were going to get a divorce, and if i could still keep watching her during the week. i told her i was sorry and absolutely, she's a delight to have around. 

yesterday she was morose, and quiet unlike she had been in a long time. turns out her parents will be separating and they'll have to move soon. she started crying and hugged me, asking if it meant she won't be able to come over anymore. i started tearing up a bit and choked out, i don't know rachel, i don't know. i hope you can. i love you, you know that? you're the smartest, cutest, best little girl in the world and i love you.""

she just cried all the harder and said i love you too. 

she even asked if she could stay with me. again i said i don't know, but i don't think it's in the cards. 

when she left yesterday i just sat down with a bottle of jack and started crying. i just can't take it. that sweet beautiful little girl that wants to be just like me, giggles when she gets grease on her, tosses on my old dirty sweater when she comes over cause she wants to help. i just want to take her up in my arms and take away that pain. she doesn't deserve to have a shitty childhood growing up with a nonexistant father or a shitty mother. fuck i just can't deal with it. it fucking tears my heart apart.

tl;dr : start babysitting a little neighbor girl with shitty parents, we have the best time together over the past year, parents are divorcing, will move away soon. fuckin hell ",12
"being the dad she always wanted. it's currently 4:30am. i was sleeping in bed with my girlfriend when all of a sudden i heard the door creak open. i opened my eyes and saw my girlfriend's daughter in the doorway. she noticed i opened my eyes and silently tip toed to me. she told me she threw up in the trash can in her room and then said she doesn't feel good at all. 

i got up and she held my hand as i walked to her bedroom and saw the vomit in her trash can. i put my hand on her forehead and she was on fire. i tried to work quickly as possible to get rid of the trash bag and fill it with a new and clean one. she ran into the bathroom and began throwing up even more. i lightly taped the door and whispered to her, ""can i come in?"" she goes, ""yeah you can, dad.""

she was extremely sick in the bathroom. my heart hurt for her cause stuff like this really takes a toll on her. 

i went through the medicine cabinet to find flu medication. once i found some, i gave it to her. 

i brought a trash can into the living room and brought some pillows and blankets out. i put on spongebob but left the volume low. i told her to come lay down and i'll get her some water. she asked me to stay because she felt so sick and was scared to be alone. 

after i got her some water, we both laid on the couch together, cuddling and watching spongebob. 

she goes, ""my real dad never helps me like this when i'm sick."" 

i didn't really know what to say. i was furious with her bio dad. 

she eventually started drifting asleep. i felt my eyes get heavy too. then i heard her say, 

""i love you dad. thank you for taking care of me.""

would be lying if i didn't say i felt tears in my eyes. i love my girlfriend's kids as if they were my own. i love when they call me dad. 

i would sacrifice myself for my girlfriend and her kids. they've given me so much and i could never repay them. 

i'm such a lucky guy. 

i told her i love her too.

edit: thank you all for the kind words, and medals! i make it a goal to reply back to everyone that comments but i'm busy today with my girlfriend and her kids! so sorry if i reply late but i promise i will get back to ya. also my dms are open if anyone needs to chat! again, thank you a lot! much love to all of you. ❤️❤️❤️☺️",12
"i eavesdropped on my girlfriend and her daughter talking together about me.. my girlfriend just got her kids back from their dads today. i'm quite as excited to have them back as my girlfriend is. those kids mean the world to me and they have no idea what they've done for me, mentally and emotionally. 

i have a fantastic relationship with her two kids. they call me dad and never by my actual name. which i'm not complaining and it felt so natural and never made me feel awkward. 

their biological dad is a very sick narcissistic person and her kids are growing up to see that now. they want to be with me and their mom full time. i've had a bunch of times where both kids cried to me in real life and over text that they want to come back and not be with their dad. i've felt so helpless but now we're gonna fight for a custody change and make my girlfriend have the majority of custody. 

anyway, after saying my hellos to both kids when i got home, i went to take a shower. the bathroom is right beside our room and her and her daughter like to watch movies in our room, which i join in on a lot of the time too. after i shut the water off i heard them talking in the next room about me. her daughter was expressing how i felt more like a real dad to her then her actual dad and that i actually pay attention to her unlike he does. he's too busy paying attention to his girlfriend and her kids, she said. she also said i take time out of my day to play with her or take her out somewhere for shopping or to get a treat. her dad doesn't do any of that. she expressed how much she loved me and wanted to stay with us. my girlfriend reassured her that we're gonna fight for her. that she loves me too. her daughter than said how i'm so much better than her dads girlfriend. she doesn't like his girlfriend. then she said she wanted to stay here on father's day and spend time with me. 

i just melted.",12
"to people all around the world. to people all around the world, 

we, hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our hong kong police force. at about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in prince edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. they ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. meanwhile, the police haven't arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd. 

we, hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope that people all over the world can help us in anyways you can think of. thank you and we will stay strong.

"you're not ugly. you just look like you.. i photograph a lot of people. almost everyone believes they are ugly. your grandmother. your child. your best friend. most models. most actors. maybe even you.

""oh, don't take my photo, i'll break your camera!"" laughs the 80-year-old grandfather. when he dies a few months later, his grandkids will treasure this reminder of his ""ugly mug.""

""please delete this,"" says a dear old friend. she looks beautiful. she looks like herself. she's been captured in a moment in which she is utterly comfortable in her skin. and she hates it.

""oh god,"" i said, because i had to get a professional headshot for work. ""i have a face like a slapped ham,"" i told the makeup artist i hired because i'm so hideous that i can't bear to have photos of me around. the selfie i took of ""the best it's ever going to get"" is my husband's iphone background.

you will never see yourself with the love that others have for you. that's what makes a person beautiful, not angles or contours. you will never be objective about your appearance. but fortunately for you, your friends and family are never objective, either: they're biased to see you through the way they smile when you walk into a room. they want every photo of you they can get their hands on, because each photo is tied to your memory.

you're the worst judge of your appearance. trust me. you look fine. the camera loves you. now take a picture.",12
"audrey i know you sneak into my room at night.. audrey when we found you, you were 1/2 dead and 100% feral. i'm glad you grew out of attacking everyone. only took 4 years. i'm glad you've learned to allow the occasional family friend to pet your head....only the head anywhere else and you bite and that took 8 years. i've accepted that you don't really like humans and are happy just doing your own thing. but can i tell you a secret? i know you come into my room at night and snuggle me. you're not exactly sly. first of all you weigh like 20lbs. you're a fat cat. so i can feel when you walk all over me. also girl you purr like a freight train when you're happy. and you tend to drool on my face when you stare at me. you always come in once you think i'm asleep and bail when i start to wake up. you're not as sly as you think you but that's okay. i love you very much and it makes me so happy you show me love in your own special way. 

edit: you guys i had no idea this would blow up and i'm so happy i could touch so many of you. i just love my little kitty and needed to get it off my chest. i've been reading her your comments. she seems pleased.

"there's an engagement ring hidden in my house right now.. my boyfriend and i were on our phones, looking through email. he was trying to find a confirmation for a thing we're doing tomorrow but couldn't. i grabbed it and went to type something in the search to bring it up, and i got a glance of an email from an engagement ring company with the subject ""order confirmation"" in his updates inbox. i froze. he froze. and then i proceeded to pretend like i hadn't seen it. 

so a few minutes later we're on the couch and we both just start kinda... giggling. and couldn't stop. and he was like ""why are we laughing?"" and i was like, ""i don't know"" and he was like ""...but you do know,"" which led to *more* laughter, cause we both obviously knew.

and then i asked if...it was here. he nodded. and then i asked if it was hidden. he nodded. and then i asked if we could play the hot or cold game, and he said ""absolutely not"" lmao.

so that's how my evening is going. i'm utterly giddy. and soooo impatient haha. i love him so much and this isn't a surprise because we regularly discuss the fact that we're going to be married as soon as it's financially possible, but having the actual ring *here* feels so cool. i can't wait to say yes.",12
"my 95 year old mom died this past week. she's from europe, lived during wwii time and loved to tell her story. i'm her only living child left and hardly anyone left for her. no big funeral. so i'm telling her story for her now. i think she would have loved that.. my mom just died. she was 95. she had such an incrediible life. but she had a small family, is from europe and has out lived most everyone in her life. i and my family is all she has left. she used to love to tell her story, especially of wwii days. if you started her talking about that she would light up. so here's her story, her sort of funeral. she would have loved to know so many people were listening. thanks for listening.

my mom was born in 1923 in saporoahje, ukraine. her dad was a professor and her mom had come from latvia to work near the university. mom had an older sister and a younger brother. she attended university for one year and wanted to be a doctor. but times were getting very hard. they had to turn over everything in their house and used to have to wait in line for a whole day for a baked potato ration. communism was taking over. mom's dad refused to become a communist. the soldiers were moving in and her parents, her and her sister fled. first to poland for a year and then onto germany. her brother was sent to latvia to be safe from being forced to be a soldier. she never found him again. my mom was the only sibling that had attended university and the only family member that also spoke german fluently and polish. she got a job in erding germany at an air force base to support her family  when it was still the luftwaffe training airfield. she was 18 or 19. she spoke such fluent german, the only one in her family to do so, and her father's parents were swedish so she had fair skin, very blond hair and blue eyes and they never suspected she was ukraine. my mom lived with a german family and they had taken her in as their very own. she had her family living at another location. she had made friends with other german women and one in particular was her best friend who had black hair and everyone called them salt and pepper. in 1945 the air force base was seized by the u.s. airforce and used as an air depot, air base and air station. she said her and her friends all thought americans would be very distinguished but when the they came, they would call out ""hey blondie"" and were not at all what they expected. at that time she met my dad who was an american air force soldier stationed there during wwii. for him it was love at first site. for her it wasn't bad but she didn't think anything of it. at one point she had agreed to meet him to get him off her back to and never planned to keep the date and hours later he was still waiting outside. from then on they were together. they attended lots of military dances together and she has often said that although it was war time, it was some of the best times of their lives. i'm told of a story where my dad had hitchhiked into some other town all day to buy my mom her very first christmas present. it didn't go without some nervous times. her and her girlfriends used to walk and often have to take cover when enemy planes flew over. one day she happened to be wearing a red dress when it happened so she was taken away from a table my mom and dad were at together, to be questioned if she was signaling the planes. their common language they both spoke was german and that's what they spoke to each other their first 5 years together. when she married him at 23 years old, her white dress was sewn out of white silk parachute. they married on christmas eve but by some old paperwork i found, states he wanted to be married on christmas day. my dad often bragged about how there was a bar made out ice that you could skate up to and their honeymoon was in garmisch and when it came time to settle the bill, the air force said it was on them. sometime during this whole time, her sister fell in love with a jewish man. they had 2 girls. he was killed in camp so my mom helped to hide those girls who were half jewish. those girls were never told their dad jewish was until they were old themselves as their mom had always been afraid people may be against jewish people again someday. mom was never clear to us the timeline on when this happened or where. when my dad's time in the military was done and he was honorable discharged, they were to leave on a ship to america with others. my mom was to leave ahead with other european wives, but friends bought her champagne the night before, that she had never drank before and thought it tasted good so drank quite a bit and was so sick the next day she missed the boat. literally. so my dad got her on the one he was on. they rode the ship for three weeks and the whole time my mom was sea sick. my dad couldn't stop eating.

they arrived in new york and then chicago and my mom couldn't believe how you could just buy things at the store. they were to make their final destination in japan as my dad was offered a civilian job on a military base there. but they stopped off in marshfield, wi, which was a small farming community, to see my dad's dad and his dad begged him not to leave and they never did. for years i grew up hearing how my mom never liked marshfield. she liked cities better. but to dad it was home and that's where he would like to stay.  my mom studied and took her citizenship test and became an american citizen in 1951. she was often quoted as saying america is the best place on earth. she just said it again to me last week. my mom, having seen how you could buy things at stores, wanted to get a job as soon as she arrived in marshfield. she got a job at a shoe factory that was piece work. meaning you got paid for every piece sewn. she had told me she was very fast and their top worker and she worked there right up until her first child was born 7 years later. they had waited so long as they could not afford children before that. during that time, my dad took out a loan and brought my mom's family to america as well even though the first five years of their marriage they couldn't afford to own a car or refrigeration. her family chose to settle in chicago in the ukraine section as they still spoke no other language and felt more at home there. i'm told her father was one of those men you would see sitting in the park playing chess and one day while doing that, had a massive heart attack and died.

my mom was pregnant with a second child that ended up dying while in the womb and she had to give birth to her. she didn't want any more children after that but after time my dad convinced her it could be different and she had another healthy son. when she became pregnant with me she started to hemorrhage and the doctors put her to bed rest. it wasn't stopping and the doctors told her i would never be born and if i was there would be so many things wrong with me so she might as well get up. she wouldn't listen and wouldn't give up and stayed in bed for 6 months. she also wouldn't take thalidomide even though they wanted her to. she wanted to take nothing to take the chance of harming me. the last 2 months she stopped bleeding and was able to go on to have a normal pregnancy. when i was born she said my dad cried because i was a girl. i suspect it was also because i was born healthy.

when i was in school, they needed a new car. so my mom got a part time job at a new store that had come to town called shopko. eventually it led to a full time job and she was head of her department for 18 years until her retirement. between the 2 of them they never in their lives made over 20,000 a year. but the house i grew up in, which was their second house, was paid off as long as i can remember even in my childhood. they never had a car loan. only paid cash. we would take driving vacations once a year and i felt spoiled at christmas. always had plenty of food. my mom was the one who paid the bills and budgeted and i remember her having a special envelope that she would put money in and once a month, fill the freezer with meat on sale from the money in that envelope.

during those 18 years my second oldest brother started showing signs of alcoholism and although they did everything in their power to help and support him, years later it took his life.

when my mom retired they traveled around to every state. many of them more than once. they mostly took tour buses and had a ball. their house was filled with souvenir coffee cups, so many coffee cups, from every place and mom would get souvenir sun visors, the kind with no top to it. their favorite place was vegas. i'm not sure if it was dad's favorite but he just loved seeing mom have so much fun. she loved the buffets and playing the slots, one time she called me at 11:00 p.m. because she had won $110 on the nickel machine. dad thought that wasn't enough to warrant a call but she didn't care she was so excited. another story they had told that makes me chuckle every time i think of it was how they went to an all girls dance show only to have the girls in the end pull off their bottoms to reveal they were actually men. i'm sure that was a huge shock to someone of their generation. but they laughed about it. during one of those trips my dad was on and escalator that suddenly stopped and he fell and hit his head. a week later he had a seizure and from then on there was a steady decline. my mom took care of him as long as she could. even after breaking a hip, after i had taken him in for a period while she recovered. i don't know how she did that. i lived 2.5 hours away and my oldest brother lived in the same town but she did it mostly all on her own. i suspect now to keep a secret just how bad it was so no one would say to put him in a nursing home. when it finally got so bad he had to go to a nursing home, she would take a taxi ( she never drove since coming to america) every day to be with him and towards the end feed him at least one meal a day.

some years later she had a house fire. after everything was fixed she moved back in but i started noticing some looping of sentences and questions and i started having to pay her bills and such. looking back i think she had a small stroke during that house fire time. she was incredibly fiercely, adamant about staying in her home. you have no idea how much, so we tried to allow that for as long as possible. she also said she would never, ever live with one of her kids as she tried to do that with her mom after her dad passed and it didn't work. but when she was 90 it was getting worse. at this time i was living 2.5 hours away. she was supposed to go for a physical one day so i asked her friend to help get her there. that morning her friend found her laying in the bath tub. she had been there for a few hours. she had fallen and although she brought a phone in it was out of reach. her friend helped her to bed but she was sick and wouldn't eat so she called an ambulance. there they found scar tissue that should she had had a stroke at some point. i'm wondering if another minor one during that time as her memory seemed worse. they had her in rehab there and when she was to be released i brought her to live near me in assisted living. it was a beautiful place and i thought she was going to love it. but once there she would have no part of it. it i wasn't there she would call me literally non-stop 24 hours a day. she called the police. she kept on insisting on going back to marshfield. the assisted living said she actually needed much more care than assisted living and needed long term care. dementia had settled in much more during that time. my oldest brother who still lived in marshfield said to bring her back. he became legally in charge of her and found long term care for her. she fought it hard at first but then settled in. during that time my oldest brother died of pancreatic cancer. i was her only child left now. she could remember other things but that. that she just wouldn't let herself remember. at first they told me to lie about it but he had told her about it before he died so she kept asking how he was and being agitated. the nurse said it wasn't working to protect her. so i would have to tell her over and over again. sometimes within a 5 minute period. and every time it was like the first time she was hearing it. eventually when i told her she wouldn't get so upset but rather wonder why she didn't remember. i said her brain just didn't want to. not long after his death, my husband i were transferred to austin, tx. i worked on getting her moved here, which proved to be much harder and much more red tape than i thought. the day before we picked her up she said she was scared but said she would trust us. the morning we picked her up and had a 3 hour drive to the airport, she didn't remember what we were doing. i held her hand while my husband drove and had her talk about germany. i was slightly panicked because you have no idea how feisty she can be and fight back. i literally made sure child safety locks were on. but as the hours passed she hadstarted remembering what we were doing and while on the plane she said she never thought at her age she would be on a plane again. surprisingly for the most part she took the move here well. but i came to see her nearly every day and she kept saying how nice it was that we lived so close to each other now. she has had several health problems in the past, arthritis in her hands and very,very bad in her shoulders, a broken hip, hiatal hernia, and advancing dementia, etc, etc, but she was still walking in a walker. but in january she started complaining of a sore hip area that ran down her leg. x-rays revealed very advanced osteoporosis and a fractured pelvis. it showed she had old fractures there in the past but this was a bad one. it also revealed a fractured arm just below her horribly arthritic shoulders that she had never said anything about. doctors don't know if it was an unreported fall or that her osteoporosis is so advanced just sitting too hard could have caused it. she used say she had aches and pains but that went with growing old. after days 3 in the hospital, at 95, they didn't want to do surgery. especially since it showed some heart irregularities. she went to a rehab and skilled nursing place just down the road from me and since the hospital and all through that time i spent all day, every day with her and i'm so glad i did. for a while she was doing better but then a decline started happening. i think she knew it was getting close because even before the hospital she couldn't tell me often enough how much she loved me and often asked about the family and how everyone was doing. she knew my son was trying to get his post college graduate job here ( he moved with us) and kept asking if he got it and when he got his dream job she would say there, now all your family is set. she had started refusing to eat. would spit it out and cover her mouth. saying i don't eat anymore. one time i said "" mom if you don't eat, you won't survive"". she shrugged and said i've lived a good long life. then a week ago she started refusing her meds. she would spit them out even if they were crushed and put into something for her. she would wave her arm and say no! so now she was getting nothing for pain. when my dad was failing she had a dnr put into place and no feeding tubes etc. she said he wouldn't want to be kept alive that way. so when she moved here i found in her papers she had made one out for herself as well. i was legally her guardian but respected her wishes. she had kept saying no food, only drink. so i could at least get nutritional drinks in her. she'd have some not so bad days and one day while laying in bed and we were looking out the window, she said i wish we could do something together. my thought went to the fact that she was pretty weak and was in a wheel chair now if she did get up and how would i take her somewhere. so i said what should we go do? but then she said that's okay, just being here together is all i need. i did take her walking outside in the wheelchair another day and was going to go on an adventure but she just wanted to go back in. i think she wanted something she knew her body couldn't handle anymore. one day she wouldn't drink any more. and that went into the next day. they ordered hospice and that would have involved morphine for pain. they felt she had some time yet as she was still having plenty of output but i had a feeling. i crawled in bed with her and held her hand and stoked her hair and forehead. if i stopped at all she would gesture to continue. she would kiss my hand. and reached for us to give a kiss. i started to talk about some happy memories but she gestured me to stop. so i just kept telling her how much i loved her. the nurse had come in at one point and checked her oxygen and such and said she was okay but i felt a panic that hospice should be starting. it was evening now and hospice was starting in the morning. but then we were all alone, and suddenly her breathing changed and she got a look in her eyes. i knew, so i stayed by her side and kissed her hand and told her how much i loved her and that would we would all be great and happy and that dad was waiting for her. her hands turned blue and she took several more breaths and was gone. it happened so fast. it was just her and i. and a part of me is glad that even though she as in pain, she went the way she wanted. taking nothing.

i know this was very long winded. but i felt such an incredible woman like that with such a long life, deserved to be told about at her death. she used to love to tell her story. especially her european days and she would have thought it was cool to have so many people listen. and there was no one to tell anymore. thank you for listening. i miss her already. per her wishes she is being cremated. as a memorial, i am thinking of mixing mom and dad's ashes into one container, and anyone who wants to go with us, go with their ashes to vegas. go to the buffets, play the slots, buy the souvenir visors and coffee mugs. go do something together.

edited:  i made a comment below but wanted to make sure all saw it.  i saw some comments asking for pictures so i put together a few of my favorite and some documents with a link. i hope it works. i cannot even begin to put into words how much all your kind words have meant to me. and to her. i just know she's reading them with me. and i'm eading each and every one. and i am ready others sharing loss and grief and worry of their own parents and grandparents. i'm so sorry you are going through that. but i'm so grateful there is a place that we can share kind words for eachother. some times, when you are out in every day life, at the grocery store, getting gas, you encounter people that may be feeling loss, or about to have loss. and they are going about their every day life and no one to share this with.  it has helped to share her story. when i think back, i wish i had taken even more time and heard even more stories but i'm so grateful for the ones i have.  and she would have loved it more than i can tell you that so many people have read her story. you have helped my heart. and i cannot thank you enough.

"yesterday i took a shower. the first since 9.30.17. no one gives you awards for taking a shower. but for me it was like climbing a god damn mountain.

&#x200b;

almost a full year ago, i was raped and left bleeding outside a bdsm club in san francisco. i was a sophomore in college, a band kid, an amazing job, and had a good life set for me on the west coast. until this happened.

i thought i had gotten my period the next morning- i would find out it was actually tears and open cuts inside me when i decided to go to the hospital. my chest was bruised so badly the mark didn't go away for almost 2 months. i had been badly hurt, and was put on anti-hiv pills. my mom flew from across the country to stay with me. after a few days, it was decided that i would move back home to heal, and reconsider school in the spring.

i was quiet, i slept until 3 in the afternoon, and my nightmares were horrible but the medication for the nightmares made me suicidal. most of all, i **hated** my body. i would wear the same outfit 3 days in a row to avoid changing, or change in the dark. the first time i washed my hair was in january, in the sink, crying in the adult psych unit. the nurses washed my hair with buckets over the sink and i felt like i was drowning.

&#x200b;

i wash my body under my clothes with bath wipes, a product meant for the elderly. i manage to wash my hair once a week, or i aim for once a week. the shower is scary.

&#x200b;

but yesterday i did it. i stood half-in, and let the water hit my back, and the top of my head, and it felt like acid at first but i stayed in there for a minute and a half. i covered myself fully in the towel and put my back against the mirror. i put clothes on.

&#x200b;

**i finally fucking showered.**

&#x200b;

will i do it again? i don't know, because the day it happened is coming up and i can already feel myself sinking down into the anxiety, the fear, and the depression of my ptsd. i climbed up one mountain but there's an entire range i have to get through.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: wow, i am blown away by everyone's kindness. i understand rip inbox now. and thank you, anonymous stranger, for the gold. i've been trying to talk more often about what happened, because if it stays in my head i go mad about it, and my ptsd goes into bad places. and as a woman, i need to tell my story, or the rapists win. i just started therapy again, which i'm fearing but going into with my head up. there is.....so much i want to say but it's near midnight. i hope to respond to as many people as i can in the morning :)


edit 2 (nov 26 2018) : i am blown away by your support, reddit. i still receive pms and they help me through the days when its even harder to get up and live. i have been able to shower three times since, thanks to float therapy. i cannot believe how amazing it is- and how much it has helped with regular therapy. i go every other week due to the cost but when i go i can shower afterwards for some reason? my guess is that the sensory deprivation in the floating chamber helps separate me from my mind and my body and i can allow myself to feel nice things, like warm water and lemongrass soap. happy holidays, heres to recovery for all <3


edit: june 25th, 2019: this post is still going around....i get a few messages every few weeks. it's a weird feeling, that people still read it and that people i don't know believe in me. on good days i feel great, but on bad days i feel like i'm letting strangers down....

i am trying to get into a residential program right now. it's out of state and there are many man hoops to jump through with insurance. but it's one step closer to getting better. i found tattoos to be healing, but it's hard to save up when living on ssi. 

as for me...things have gotten worse in many ways, but they've also gotten better. i'm back to showering out of a bucket and the sink. i still feel as if my body is some strange creature. but i wake up every morning. there isn't that immediate fear whenever i hear a door open. i have less nightmares. i collect furbys. i am trying to build a life outside of my trauma- i joined a band, i saw a new primary care doctor, i even started saving for a trip to the netherlands in may...

i started living. i guess i figured out how to move on.",12
"i'm ugly. i get it. stop telling me that i am ""lucky"" for having an attractive husband. i'm a worthwhile person, too.. i'm average looking at best. many even find me ugly. it is what it is. i can't say that i'm ""over"" the fact that people find me ugly because being physically unattractive has gotten me rude comments about my appearance for most of my life. and i know it's not just people being mean. when i'm out with my attractive friends, i notice how people treat them very differently (in a positive way). it's a level of privilege that i'll never experience, which sucks, but it's certainly not my friends' faults. 

where i *do* get upset is when people feel the need to comment on how ""lucky"" i am. my husband is often jokingly called the third hemsworth brother. he's a good looking dude. i don't disagree with that fact at all. when people meet my husband for the first time i *always* get comments. ""you're so *lucky* you managed to get a guy like him."" or ""that's *your* husband?"" or ""oh, you've been together since high school. *now* it makes sense."" like, wtf?

some of these comments could definitely be innocent enough except for two things. first, their stress on certain words that clearly imply that they think he's way out of my league. secondly, it's never ever the other way around. people never make comments like that to my husband about how ""lucky"" he is for snagging me. 

the worst time was one day a few years ago when i was waiting tables to pay my way through college. i had been working at the restaurant for over a year at that point. my husband came in by himself and sat in my section, so we could sort of ""hang out"" (we both had really busy schedules back then, so we weren't able to spend much time together). several of my female coworkers (and even some of my gay male coworkers) kept pointing out the ""hot guy who looks like liam hemsworth"" sitting at table such-and-such. they kept telling each other about him and encouraging each other to walk by his table to ""go check him out."" it was kind of funny at first, until i told one of them that he was my husband. ""he's *your* husband?"" the coworker asked incredulously. next thing i know, i'm overhearing my coworkers say shit like, ""yeah, that's apparently *cnyrxx's* husband. like, how and the hell did she manage that?"" and other similar things when i'm walking by them to get to the kitchen/my tables. i felt like crying before the day was over.

i wanted to get this off my chest because i just got another comment like this today. i don't know if it's because i'm feeling particularly insecure today since i'm about to start my period, but jesus christ. i'm a fucking worthwhile person, too, and there are things about me that make my husband fucking lucky to have ""caught"" me, too (to which he whole-heartedly agrees, but i digress). 

i'm just sick of it. and i'm sick of being made to feel like i have no value as a human being because i am not physically attractive. 

people suck.",12
"i witnessed a love story unfold over a few months outside the bedroom window of my townhouse.. i f 26 suffer from chronic depression, and some related complications such as low self esteem, body image issues and insomnia.

some months ago i heard a noise outside of my bedroom, like the sound of someone running. so i get up, a rare moment of curiosity. sure enough, at 3am there's this hell fat dude jogging, he's got a jumper on and headphones, looks like he's out there jogging for fitness. probably too shy to jog in the day, little did he know i was up and awake and watching. i thought to myself, heh, he'll probably give up tomorrow.

the next day i didn't see him, didn't think much of it, to be honest i forgot about it after that

three days later i hear some jogging outside my window, again in those ungodly hours of the night which have become my solace. sure enough, it was that guy again. again i thought he'd give up, but the next day he was back, and the day after that as well. at this point i was still skeptical, but i was like good on you dude, you've exceeded my ability to commit at least. 

over the next week he kept returning, he only missed two days. i have to admit, i became way too invested in this stranger's journey of self improvement at this point. i came to calling him danni in my head, dunno why, he seemed like a gentle dude and i liked that name for him. i found myself looking forward to seeing him run every morning. now i have to mention that when i say run, i mean he runs for like a minute or two and then walks until he can breathe again. most would laugh but i found it admirable. i could run way further than this guy if i had to but i'd go home the moment i lost my breath or felt uncomfortable, danni is repeatedly exposing himself to this, over and over. he's on a mission, he's also the most meaningful thing in my life at the moment.

a month passes from when he stated, and to be honest i kinda lost interest a bit. i found myself resenting his orders more self motivation than what i have. however just as i was becoming aware of this feeling he stopped running. to be honest he had not really lost any weight and his only sign of progress was that he could now run further than the view from my window could afford me line of sight. after a few days when i noticed, i genuinely felt sad.

another month passes and my sleep has drifted further and further into the morning hours, this is pretty usual for me. one day i stay up particularly late-early and as i go to close the blinds because the god damn sun is killing me, i spot danni running! he had not actually stopped running, he'd just started doing it at normal hours! this was the first time i felt joy in about 2 weeks, i felt elated, i wanted to shout out to him, i didn't.

now i was enthralled. i had to see him every day. and sure enough he did keep showing up, almost every day. there was this one period of maybe 4 or 5 days where he didn't, but after that he started up again and my respect for him was solidified. here is this man, a painting of what society would describe as soft, a loser, at the bottom of the social ladder, but that's not what i saw. i should say though that it might sound like my admiration was becoming romantic, but it really wasn't like that. i admired him from a distance as a sort of role model whom i'd never want to meet less that illusion be shattered. in my mind he was the embodiment of hope, if i met him he'd collapse like a quantum particle or whatever and become a very real very flawed human. 

after this roughly two more months pass, he has his ups and downs, days skipped, days where he's just walking. all the while he's started losing weight, but he's still got a longgg way to go to looking healthy. 

then one day , around the time he'd be running by my house i hear the giggling of a girl. now at this point i was more checking in once a week to see if he was still running, he didn't have a perfectly regular schedule, so i would have to watch through the window from my bed for a while whenever i wanted to see him otherwise i might miss him. on this day though i had to go check what this girl was laughing at. i'd be so heartbroken if danni was being bullied, i mean who would just openly make fun of someone for being fat and trying to do something about it today? instead i see danni walking alongside this girl. wow danni! she's like wayyy out of his league. i don't really buy that league thing entirely but damn this girl is pretty and she's wearing all that tight fitting sportswear, she seems like she's got that amazing sense of style where she always looks great, i've always envied that. i hear danni talking to her, and that's the first time i heard his voice. he's just chatting, she seems like a really bubbly kind of person, nothing he's saying is that funny, but when she laughs you can see him beaming with pride. her laugh clearly makes his day but tbh it's pissing me off. at the same time i feel really happy for him, but i can't help but feel cynical, he's probably never going to be with this girl. she's just using him because she's deeply insecure (like me) but instead she seeks attention to try to fill the void, while i guess i embrace it like that old friend you love to hate and hate to love.

over the next weeks this girl occasionally joins him, out of 5 weeks she joined him maybe 8 times, while he was now running every single day except weekends. occasionally i could glimpse snippets from their conversation when they happens to walk past my window instead of running, sometimes they were just quietly walking but mostly she was her bubbly self and either chatting away about nothing or listening to him, occasionally laughing and giggling. 

i have to say, and this completed surprised me, but at first danni, who's still obese at this point was able to run further than the girl! she had a gorgeous body , like most days she'd wear a top that revealed her midriff and it's not like you could see her abs or anything but her stomach was quite flat, i guess she was unfit though! she quickly caught up though and was able to run as far as he could as she stated to come more regularly. two months in and she was joining him three times a week. i still don't know their relationship, i think they are friends, i saw them hug one time when they were both super out of breath, but that's the only time i saw contact between them. they'd taken to sharing earphones with like a splitter thing, i thought that was kinda cute. usually i fucking hate cutsie couples but thinking they weren't a couple let me see past that i guess. during this time the girl also spotted me watching them and i stopped watching them, but i could still hear them outside sometimes. i had changed my mind about her though, she seemed okay.

the thing about my depression is that sometimes you go long periods of feeling nothing, and then out of nowhere emotions return in this flood like an enormous dam has been holding them back and now they are out, so one morning when she mentioned her boyfriend it hit me way harder than it should have, i wasn't ready for it! she said ""oh my boyfriend and i are going up north for the long weekend so i won't be able to come on monday."" i couldn't hear danni's response. i've been in both of their positions, assuming he's madly in love with her. it sucks. 

another month passes and the girl is now only showing up twice a week. i've started watching them again but now it's more of a habit. i'm happy for the guy, he's starting to look healthy, he's still got a bit of fat but man has he come a long way. she's looking amazing as always. then on day i spot the cutest moment. it seems like they'd been pushing each other to run further and faster, and on this day i see them in the park that's about 100 meters or so from my house, at first she's bent over seemingly heaving for breath, he's pacing around, looking up, trying to catch his breath too. they have one of those chats where it's far more breathing than words being spoken, but i can't hear them, only see them. then he gently grabs her hand and holds it to his neck, i guess he asked her to check his pulse, she shakes her head and smiles while holding her fingers under his jaw. he then does the same to her, and it they look at each other for a moment, just standing there for a second index finger or each other's pulses, breathing. i thought this was super cute and i wish i had been closer and taken a photo. 

that was 17 days ago. i decided to write this story because yesterday i watched them both finish their run in that same park, totally out of breath. the girl sat down on the grass and after a minute the guy offered her a hand to get up. she took his hand and as soon as she got up she went for a hug. they hugged for a good 20 second kind of slowly swaying. when they broke apart he held her by the shoulders, and then they got close again and kissed. 

danni, i'm going to stop watching you, i wish you the best of luck and if you're reading this please know that you've been the only meaning in my life for months now, i'm so happy for you and i sincerely hope things work out for you and the girl. perhaps you were doing this all for her from the start, but even if it doesn't work out with her please don't stop running. i'm not even slightly jealous of you two, or your progress. 9 days ago i started running at 3am and i've not missed a day.



edit:
thanks for everyone who has read, and all the up votes and comments and awards! i honestly thought this post might die in the weeds as many of my others have, i didn't expect this kind of response. i created a new account because discrimination against those with mental illness is real. anyway it fills my heart with joy that i could inspire even one person to get out there and make their life better for themselves, and i think danni would feel the same! at first i started by up voting and reading all your comments and replying to every person who rewarded me an award or made a comment, because you all deserve to be noticed! it does get a bit overwhelming though, but i will still read every comment even if i don't respond, that's a promise!",12
"i found my husband's secret stash.. we keep no secrets from each other (except for keeping the door closed when we poop). i went looking for one of our old credit cards. he has a few little hidey holes for important stuff, he's like wall-e, so i went to his bedside table, bottom drawer, where he occasionally keeps old financial stuff. 

and there it was, just staring at me. i had no idea. 

every card i've ever given him, every cutesy love letter, every sappy post-it. stacked neatly in the back corner. some in envelopes, some out. over six inches high. every card i fretted over, every page of handwritten 3am hopes and dreams. i'm a writer, so words are important to me and they are the way i express myself when it's difficult to do so verbally. he knows this. 

people always say it's so nice to see how happy we are. that we're ""that couple"". i feel it. it's not like we never left the honeymoon phase. we had some issues for a while, most people don't know, but we pushed through and we're both better partners because of it. i never thought i could be this happy. in a million years, i never would have dreamed that i could have this kind of loving, challenging, supportive, affectionate, sexy, silly, perfectly complimentary relationship. i feel lucky every day to have found this wonderful man and i will never, ever take it for granted. 

but seeing that stack of cards, even though it may seem small to some in the grand scheme of things, just really made me happy today. i told him i loved him for the first time in a rambling valentine's day card, 7 1/2 years ago. we make a special point on every birthday, anniversary, whatever, to get the other person a nice card, write a little something. 

maybe one day he'll be looking for something and find my stash, tucked away in my bookshelf: a stack of every card he's ever given me.

edit: i think it's very ""reddit"" that everyone's initial expectations went in such different directions - candy to fake money to guns to a variety of drugs to hentai. we truly do live in a society. thanks for all the love - i don't have writing up anywhere else currently, for anyone that asked, but i'm considering posting now, hah.",12
"my girlfriend washed my hair today. it felt so good. we don't normally shower together, but today we did, nothing sexual happened or anything but i just feel so on cloud nine right now.

when i reached for the shampoo she said ""wait,"" and  grabbed it herself and started running it through my hair, lathering it over my scalp and massaging my head. i swear it felt so good i just shut my eyes and felt like i was floating. then she took the soap and started sudsing me up, and used her body to spread it all over me, and rinsed me clean, using her hands to splash me and running her fingers through my hair and spending like a good five minutes just rinsing my hair and kissing my back and chest. it was almost surreal.

i just feel so incredibly loved right now, i almost got overwhelmed and started crying from being so happy while she was doing it. i've never had a girlfriend be so gentle and make me feel like this, i've always been with people who were very cold and i'm not used to this feeling. and i've got no one i can really express things like this to. which, when i think of it, is really pretty screwed up.

i love her so much.

&#x200b;

edit: wow, thank you for the gold and silver, kind strangers! i had no idea this would blow up, but i guess it speaks to a lot of people. i'll be sure to do my best to reciprocate the intimacy, and i wish you all the same feelings i got. 

take care of each other",12
"i did it ! i took off my hijab. &#x200b;

my parents are quite religious, they forced me both me and my sister to wear the hijab at age of 15. i never agreed to it, i cried hysterically telling them how much i dont want to wear it and yet they forced me to.  

in the past years i tried my best to convince myself to just accept it but it didn't work, it's just not who i am.

i always tell people to be comfortbale with themselves, to be themselves, and stand for what they believe in even if it's not the popular thing to do. and if i'm not practicing what i preach so as a person i'd be a liar.

so today at age of 24 i decided to take off my hijab behind my parents back, when i'm with friends, or in events i take it off and i must tell you that i feel happier and confident more than ever. 

my mom always raised us to do things for people, "" don't do this, don't do that, what people will say ? what people will think of you ? ""

so my decision was very out of my comfort zone, and i'm happy i did it.

maybe i started late but from now on i'm committing to work on my charisma and self esteem and not let anyone decide who i should be but me.",12
"a letter to my son. you came home this weekend, visiting from college. we'd texted asking what we could get at the store for you, and you'd replied chicken in a biscuit crackers and peaches. i bought a few more things because that's what moms do. there were yogurts in the fridge, along with milk. crispex, your favorite cereal. some fruit roll ups. i forgot to tell you about the chocolate pie.

&#x200b;

we had friends over for board games saturday. they hadn't met you yet. i happily told them about how you were doing in school, and your pride in your luxurious and lengthy locks. about how you'd told me your hair was softer than mine. i had made peanut butter fingers for dessert, and told them how i'd send the rest of them back to college with you. i thought you were out visiting your friends, but then you got up from a nap, and came in to say hi, and meet our friends for the first time. we smiled and introduced you. i'm glad they met you.

&#x200b;

you didn't stay for dinner. you were snowed in last weekend when you came down to visit, and had a lot of friends you wanted to hang out with this weekend. i said something, i don't remember. was it ""cya!"" or ""have fun!""? i almost told you to text if you'd be out late, but you're 18, so i was trying to treat you like a grown up. you took the car out.

&#x200b;

you struggled the first quarter, last quarter. you failed the first math midterm, since your high school teachers had left you woefully unprepared. your math teacher had a policy though, where you could get the grade in the class of either your midterms, or of your final. you decided to learn everything you should have in high school, then started relearning everything in the book from the start. you pulled off a great grade. i was so proud of you. you bragged about being a mother fucking prodigy in your cs class (you were too old to be a prodigy at 18, but i let that slide), but i was so much more proud of what you accomplished in math than of how you did in cs.

&#x200b;

you struggled with some other things too. things you opened up about. some addictions, anxiety, depression. after your friend killed himself last summer, you got your first tattoo. it was a semicolon with a heart at the top of it. mental health awareness. you got it huge- most semicolon tattoos are tiny little things, but yours was a good three inches or more. you took my advice and had it done by a professional, rather than your friend with the tattoo gun, even though you had to wait a few more weeks. you had it before you left for college.

&#x200b;

after your friend died, we made appointments with a counselor. you told me you liked her, and that she was helping. she hadn't been taking new clients, but made an exception for you. at first i drove you to the appointments, and waited in the room outside. then you started driving yourself to them. you started seeing someone else up at college, and they gave you the medicine you needed, and we had our first bipolar diagnosis. i warned you that it can take a while and multiple tries to find the right medication.

&#x200b;

i gave you advice a lot. and i worried a lot. i told you it was my prerogative as a mom to do both. you were planning on moving out from the dorms, and i had started searching for some dump crockpot recipes to help you feed yourself. we had always talked about having me give you cooking lessons, but hadn't yet found the time. you told me about the duplex you would rent, but never sent the link. my sister and i started filling it with imaginary furniture anyway. you'd need a bed, a dresser, a couch. maybe, we didn't know if it would be furnished. you knew i worried, and once you joked that i always expected the worst things to happen. about defensive driving because of other drivers on the road. about providing your own condoms instead of using ones girls provided.

&#x200b;

i didn't worry about guns. you had promised me you would tell me if you ever felt like ending it. you told me how mad you were your friend killed himself. how mad you were he acted like everything was fine, how he said he was grabbing his headphones from the car, but instead drove off.

&#x200b;

you won't read this note. it's monday. i saw you last on saturday, going to visit your friends. according to your best friend, you had a great time. you told her your usual goodbye ""te amo"" and left to come back home. she said you even drove parallel to each other before taking your usual turn off. but instead you went to the beach. i went there for the first time 2am sunday. you'd sent her a suicide note. she called the police and had her sister drive you to our house. you wouldn't answer your phone, but she had the find my friend with your location.

&#x200b;

i got to the beach, but we weren't allowed to leave the car. it was cold out, but that wasn't why i was shivering. your friend was crying, but your father and i were just holding hands. i knew it was bad when the officer asked for the back window to be rolled down. it was to talk to us first. i couldn't find the button, someone else rolled it down.

&#x200b;

i miss you. so so much. i have the leftover peanut butter fingers, and that chocolate pie i hadn't told you about. those are only two of the many things around the house telling me about how i'll never see you again. there will be more. i had ordered some stress reliever toys from ebay. i didn't know if they'd make it in time for your care package this month, or if it would be next quarter. i ran out of time first quarter and used a preassembled amazon snack pack for first quarter care package, and i wanted to do a better job this time. your best friend told me you had liked it.

&#x200b;

i didn't sleep yesterday. i took a benadryl last night, and woke up this morning feeling almost human. until i remembered. i've already started on the kleenex. there will be more family visiting today. they keep asking if they can do anything. there are no words i need, no tasks i need done. i don't know what to do. i can't take back any of my previous actions, my previous words. i can try and help your father know he was a good dad, the best. you won't get my future words. i never told you i was considering writing you a manual for how to live life. a little presumptuous i know, i never had it all figured out either. but, here's a letter. i love you. i tried to tell you every time i dropped you off, even in college. i love you kid.

&#x200b;

edit: i can't tell you how much it has meant to read these replies. thank you. thank you. i may reply to more, but here's what i really wanted to say right now.

"yesterday i had my physically abusive wife arrested. we have been together for 11 years, married for 9. things have always been a bit stormy beteeen us, but have been getting worse for about 6 months. she is very controlling and manipulative to the extent my wages had to be paid into her account, i had to do the housework to her specification, or else she would lash out at me with wooden spatulas. if i argued with her she lashed out. if i talked moderately (she called it ""shouting"") she would lash out. she would also deny me meals, wouldnt allow me to have my own door key, she told me i was worthless and nobody would want me. if i tried to defend myself from her attacks she said she would have me arrested and i would lose my job. yesterday was the last straw. after being hit once again, i called the police and had her arrested. i have moved out of the home, i'm in a bed and breakfast tonight. tomorrow i'm going to the council about getting accommodation.  my life is now restarting and this time i'm in the driving seat.",12
"i just found my boyfriend's suicide note. ""if you are reading this, i am no longer alive."" that was the first line on a note i found that my boyfriend wrote a few days ago. it felt like my heart instantly stopped beating, i couldn't move. when i finally allowed myself to continue i didn't understand what i was reading. 

my boyfriend. the one who constantly supports me in everything i do. the one who never fails to have a smile on his face. the one light of hope in my life. i had no idea he felt like his presence on this earth was meaningless. i had no idea that he felt absolutely worthless. 

he apologized to his family knowing all the pain it would bring. he thanked them for all their support but told them that there was nothing they could've done to prevent it. i put myself in their shoes and couldn't possibly imagine losing a child, a brother, a best friend. 

then it was my turn. ""my darling, the most painful goodbye."" i wanted so badly to just stop reading and tell myself this wasn't happening. the things he said about me.. how much i changed his life. the way he'd miss looking into my eyes, feeling my touch. he said he hopes he'd be able to look down on me, he wished i would find my true soulmate. someone to make me happier than he ever did. all of my emotions were piling up and i could barely breathe. how could he not understand that he is my soulmate? he is the reason i wake up in the morning, he's the reason for every smile i make, every moment of joy i feel. 

the good thing about all of this is that he's still here with me, alive. i'm not sure what would've been his breaking point and when it would've happened. if i had found that note after the fact, my life would be very different today. he woke up when he heard me crying and asked what was wrong. i asked what the note was and began crying hysterically. 

he held me and we cried together. i told him how much i needed him, how i couldn't continue to build my life without him by my side. i told him i'd do whatever is necessary to keep him here with me. 

the happiest of people can still feel so alone sometimes. even though this was absolutely heartbreaking, i'm glad i know what he's going through and how i can help him if he ever feels this way again.


edit: thank you everyone, so much for all of the kind words, support and love. i have read all the comments and there's just no way i can respond to each of them individually. thank you all for sharing your stories, my deepest condolences go out to all of you who have lost someone you love. i am eternally grateful my boyfriend is with me today. i told him how much support he was getting from everyone and he teared up. seriously, i can't thank you guys enough. your advice was amazing and i know how i can help him more than ever now! sending so much love to you all! ❤️",12
"my abused adopted dog let me to pet him after 2 years of being scared of me.. today- the day when i felt how satisfaction feels like. i can't explain how happy i am for my dog, after 2 years of tears, struggling with eating, sleeping and helping my little to socialize with other humans and dogs, today, we did it. until today, my dog never let me to pet him, he was just happy when i came home eventually, keeping the distance from me. i can't imagine what this dog been through and how can he feel about everything that happened. but after 2 years, he felt safe for the first time. he deserve the best, and humans were horrible to him. 
i am so proud of him.",12
"i found my wife's body in the closet yesterday. pretty self explanatory. i'd left for work at 9 the night before, got off early since it was my weekend, and went upstairs to find she'd hung herself from our closet door. she suffered from mental health issues most of her life and i guess i knew this might happen one day, but i didn't think it would be yesterday.

the police came and went. ""we're sorry for your loss."" 

some friends came and picked me up, i'll be staying in the guest room for a bit i guess. my family came to pick up my son, he'll be 3 in april. my sister in law is going to look after him so at least he'll have his cousins to play with him. i had to comfort her mother, who blames herself. i had to call my job to tell them i needed some time. i had to call estranged friends, having them disseminate to others i couldn't reach. got drunk. took an ambien. slept. went to the carwash with a friend. stayed there until 3am. watched space jam when i got back. talked to my dead wife in the rain. 

it's been a rollercoaster of tears and laughter and silence and i have so my questions that can wait.

 the weirdest thing is though, i'm feeling intensely aroused and i'm having trouble falling asleep. normally i masturbate to help myself drift off and believe me, i want to. but i don't think i can. looking at porn seems... disrespectful? and i can't close my eyes without seeing her so... here i am. wide awake. spilling my guts into the void.

yesterday was the worst day of my life, and i'm worried about masturbation. god help me.

edit: just wanted to say how grateful i am for everyone who reached out this morning. i want to say so much more, but everything i type looks wrong. my son and i will be okay. my wife is no more pain. i have the most wonderful group of people sitting in this room with me now. i'm not angry. not with my wife anyhow. i'm angry with her disease, but i couldn't have asked the girl i married to go on hurting anymore. 

if you or someone you know is suffering from mental health problems, let someone know. let someone try. fight like hell. kiss your wife when you leave for work.",12
"i use my unattractiveness to protect other girls. i'm not objectively ugly, just charmless and average enough to go by unnoticed most of the time. 

whenever i'm on the subway and i notice some guy agressively checking out a pretty girl or staring at them creeply, i shield her with my plain figure and block their vision. i'm taller than most girls, so i usually provide enough cover for them.

today, a guy changed seats just to keep checking out a girl's ass after she moved away from him. i stood between them and saw he trying to circle around to get a better vision, but guess what? i can move too, asshole. i even got out on the same station as her to make sure the guy couldn't take a single last look at her. 

sometimes i feel good about doing it, but mostly i feel enraged that women have to put up with this crap everyday.

edit: just to clarify, i'm a girl.
averagedit: thank you, kind strangers, for the gold and silver! i also want to assure you all i don't find myself ugly, i'm ok with being average looking. i have attractive qualities, they are just not in plain sight haha.",12
i pretend to be asleep so i can hear my girlfriend sing.. sometimes i just pretend to be asleep in bed and she lays down next to me and softly sings. i had to tell this to someone. she gets really embarrassed and doesn't like it when people hear her sing. so i pretend to fall asleep just to hear her.,12
"working 60 hours a week isn't a badge of honor. working nonstop isn't noble. society needs to stop this crap.. i'm so tired of this idea that we need to work stupid amounts of hours to ""make something"" of ourselves. i have a stupidly easy self employed job. i work maybe 10 hours a week and it's more than enough to support my lifestyle with lots of savings left over. everyone i know knows this, yet i'm constantly hounded with ""why don't you get a real job?"" or ""you should go back to school and get a degree in something!"".

no

no never. i would never want to work 40 hours. i never want to work 60. work is not some wonderful beautiful thing. unless you truly enjoy what you do, and lets face it, 90% of people don't, it's just shit. i've worked in tech. i've lived the wake up->work->sleep in the car to skip the commute tomorrow for an early morning lifestyle. it's terrible. there isn't a company out there i'd happily do that for. there isn't a company i'd happily work a 9-5 for.

even here on reddit. someone complains about mandatory overtime working 70 hours a week. the response? ""you should feel lucky to have a job!"" and ""can i take your spot?"" really? this is living? this isn't living.

if you can't find importance in your life without working 40+ hours a week, you need better hobbies. we should be working less as automation takes over. yet everyone has this mindset that work is life and pointless without it, so big corporations have free reign on fucking everyone over since ""you should be happy we hired you! now clean our boots and sleep in the closet tonight cause you have a doubleshift!""",12
"my father, filmmaker rob cohen, is a rapist and child molester. my name is valkyrie weather, born kyle cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director rob cohen (the fast and the furious, xxx, and the hurricane heist among many others). when i was very young, rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. my mother witnessed one of the assaults when i was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. this fact has cost me more than i could ever convey here. rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. i know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote.  presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in thailand and the czech republic starting when i was as young as 13/14 years old. through therapy and support from loved ones, i no longer feel that i owe this man any loyalty. and thanks to the #metoo movement, i have found the will to speak out. while rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, i demand that my story be heard. i am not seeking financial restitution, nor do i have a career to promote. my greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by rob cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.


edit: thank you for the silver and gold, it's truly humbling. however, instead of giving me more please send a donation to trans lifeline or the joyful heart foundation. thank you again. ",12

"i was raped and impregnated. i am tired of people speaking on my behalf.. i was invited to hang out with my friend and his middle aged coworker. after we picked up some liquor, we went back to my friend's house, smoked a blunt, and started drinking. everything was fine up until they both left the room. my friend comes back and tells me that his coworker was expressing his interest in me. i was shocked as my relationship was public knowledge, but decided to play nice because i didn't want to make the situation awkward, thinking nothing would come of it as my friend was present. his coworker came back upstairs, and shortly after, my friend fell asleep.

&#x200b;

the coworker then got close to me on the futon, trying to coax me into drinking the contents of the red solo cup in his hand. after trying to say no several times, i gave in. it didn't taste of too much alcohol. shortly afterwards, i felt sick and decided to lay down. i only had two double shot drinks, and whatever was in his cup. he proceeded to put a fruit snack in his mouth and told me that eating the fruit snack would make me feel better. i started getting dizzy. once again, i resisted, but after he put his face directly in front of mine, i obliged and tried to take the fruit snack from his mouth with my teeth as to not make contact. that's when he forced his lips on mine. i tried to get away, but realized i couldn't move my limbs. i was stuck. i tried to say no, but my slurred words had no effect. at that point, i knew what was going to happen and just tried to keep my eyes shut until it was over. he raped me. after he was done, he cuddled me as if he had done nothing wrong, stroking my hair and telling me he was going to take care of me. i passed out soon after.

&#x200b;

the next day my mother picked me up, and after she saw the choke marks on my neck, i broke down and told her i was raped. she tried to get me to go to the er for a rape kit, but i was scared about missing work and trying to forget what had just occured. i tried to adjust back to normal life, but shortly afterwards was put in an intensive outpatient program and diagnosed with ptsd.

&#x200b;

at the time i had an ovarian cyst that needed monitoring via ultrasound. i went to my ultrasound appointment, which was exactly one month after the assault had happened. as the ultrasound was happening, i noticed a small circle on the screen, but thought nothing of it, thinking it might have been a blood clot as my period was a tad bit late. the technician finishes, and goes and phones the doctor. i didn't hear the conversation, but he came down and spoke with me. he asked if i was sure i wasn't sexually active. i cried and told him no but that i had just been raped. he informed me that the circle on my ultrasound might be an embryo and that i needed to take a urine pregnancy test. i called my partner after i provided my sample and wept. he kept me calm and assured me no matter what he would be there for me. the doctor came back in with a heavy face and broke the news to me. i was pregnant. i sobbed for what felt like ages. my mother and i left, and she told me she would stick by whatever decision i made. i already knew what i was going to do.

&#x200b;

i called planned parenthood and scheduled for a medical termination of my pregnancy. they told me scheduling would take two weeks, as i had to attend an informational meeting first. those two weeks were the longest two weeks of my life.

&#x200b;

i was terrified to go outside, convinced people would know about the dirty secret i was carrying in my womb. i was convinced the embryo was a parasite planted by my rapist to drain the life from me. there was not a second i was not in emotional distress. every minute was torture, reliving what he did to me and feeling my body change in a response to what had been done. i had never experienced a level of body dysphoria like that. i couldn't look at myself in the mirror, or be nude for longer than 30 seconds at a time. i was rapidly switching between dissociation and flashbacks. the intensive outpatient program i was in refused to give me anything stronger for my anxiety, as it could damage the embryo, despite my begging and pleading and promising that i was absolutely certain i would terminate. it was a constant battle not to take my own life. i remember walking into planned parenthood, surrounded by people calling me a murderer. i told them i was raped, and they told me it was god's plan and that the abortion would be another trauma. i was livid, furious at these people for ignoring my state of distress in the name of their personal beliefs.

&#x200b;

i went through with the abortion. it was painful, and sad, but in no way a trauma. this was my freedom from my rapist. this was reclaiming my body. this was being free. i am sad about it because this was not my choice. i never had a choice in this. this was the doing of my rapist, and what i did was the only way to save my life and reclaim some sense of normalcy. if i had been forced to go through with the pregnancy, i would have killed myself. had it been a birth control failure, i would not have terminated, but that is my choice and my choice alone to continue my pregnancy. i can not make choices for other people, as pregnancy is different for every woman, and it is their choice to make.

&#x200b;

i am extremely angry, shocked and disappointed at what is going on in alabama. women like me, women that are hurting, terrified, unready will not be able to get the procedure they need to be well. i am scared for them. i am scared for all women. these laws will strip us of our bodily autonomy, turning us into incubators for our predators. how many women will take their lives? how many women will die of unsafe abortions? this is the very definition of archaic. i've heard people say ""abortion is a trauma itself"", ""pregnancy is a blessing from god"", and ""but what about the child?"". i do not need anyone to speak for me. i am valid, and i will be heard. my termination was not a trauma, it was the first step in healing the wounds my rapist planted in my being. i do not want other people's religions dictating what happens with my body. the embryo i terminated was just that, an embryo. it had no thoughts, no feelings. had i continued the pregnancy, i would have died. if i had survived, the pregnancy would have destroyed my body, permanently scarring me and producing a baby that would be despised, unloved, and thrown into a system that repeatedly time and time again fails children. how is that a quality life for either of us? i am sick and tired of people dictating what women should do with their own bodies. termination is a personal decision and is no one's business but the pregnant woman.

&#x200b;

if i had to relive that again, i would still make the same decision. my abortion saved my life.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much for your support, and for the reddit awards. i plan on responding to each and every one of your comments once i get off work. i love you all.

&#x200b;

edit 2: reddit wouldn't let me comment for an hour or so, so i've responded to what i can for tonight and i will continue responding to comments tomorrow. you are all in my thoughts, and i am so thankful for your support. my pms are open to all who need a shoulder to lean on, or even just a friendly conversation. making this post is probably one of the best things i've done for my healing, and i've learned a very valuable lesson. despite how loud ignorance can be, love and compassion will always be louder. carry that love with you and share it with others. goodnight, and i hope you all have a wonderful day.",12
"just got married and we got the worst news.. we got married 19 september 2019. 
we have been together for 3 years and are madly in love. she is the best thing that happend in my life.

we had a wonderfull day and we were happy and in love. almost everything went as planned.

then came the honeymoon. 

we went to the carribean and did a cruise and stayed on curaçao for a week. we visited so many places and did amazing things, but during the honeymoon, my wife kept getting bruises, that could not be explained. also a lot of headaches. we thought it was strange but nothing to worry about. 

then in the last days of the honeymoon, my wife had a blood spot in her eye and got a nosebleed that went on too long.

a doctor came and examined my wife. he could not find anything strange and told us to visit the doctor we we got back.

so 2 days later, we are back and visited the doctor. high blood pressure and he ordered blood tests.

we went in the morning to get the blood tests done and got a call from the hospital in the afternoon. 

we had to go to the hospital with haste.
after 2 hours of more tests we got the worst news.

my wife has acute leukemia.

to be precise acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
a form of leukemia that causes bleeding and clots at the same time. 

it turns this kind of leukemia is more deadly at the start  and we were very lucky. 

there is a silver lining. apl is treatable and has a high survival rate. my wife will be treated with vitamin a and arsenicum. no chemo is needed ... yeahh.

but despite the high survival rate and no chemo. there are still risks. so we have to discuss many things newly weds should not have to discuss.",12
"i was raped by a woman and it ruined my life. i expect this will get downvoted into oblivion but i want to share this, and for the last time. being open about my experience has caused me nothing but pain and loss.

i'm a father and recently divorced, dating again... or was. after a failed loveless marriage was clearly dead end, i took steps to lose weight and get healthy. my love life prior had been sparse and i dated what i could get, including a short empty marriage and a the aforementioned loveless one. i was not longer morbidly obese and for the first time seen as genuinely attractive by a lot of women.

a small piece of background detail, i was physically abused as a child viciously. yeah, i know a lot of people were. i was also molested by my mother, a very toxic and damaged person. this is also something i won't be sharing again either as most have attacked me over their need to never believe a mother could do such a thing. obviously, my ability to feel trust and comfortable around women was damaged. this becomes key later.

i dated a lot of women, even went to therapy again. i had a couple short term relationships, and had finally reached a point when i was truly able to open my heart, trust and love freely. i felt strong and secure. 

then i met her.

we had amazing chemistry from the start and kissing her was amazing on our second date. the third date was fun too, and we fooled around a little, but something felt off so not much more. we made plans to meet the next night.

i came over and we talked. i opened up about some of my past issues, hoping that being completely open would ease my own last lingering doubts. she became cold, and tore me apart, emotionally, emasculating and humiliating me until i was to the point of tears. i never felt so small and worthless in my life. 

she then climbed on top of me and raped me. i did not consent to it. i said no. she didn't care, i was a piece of meat to her. my body betrayed me and responded, but i was dying inside, repulsed and violated. afterwards, she was done with me, and i left. i vomited outside of her apartment, went home. i cried that whole night and didn't sleep until dawn.

i reached out to friends, but was thought to be lying, or a loser. a couple of female friends became furious with me as they had really been raped, but men can't be. obviously i was unstable as why hadn't i enjoyed it? one by one i watched most of my relationships crumble or be damaged. last night, my best friend and i parted ways. things haven't been the same since that happened to me, after all i was supposed to be the strong friend she replied on.

men aren't allowed to be raped or molested and talk about it. we are laughed at and derided. just stop being a wimp and get over it.

i'm writing this because i'm tired of having to explain myself anymore, having to validate that it really happened to me. i'm tired of the jokes, the loss of respect. i don't date anymore, as i see every woman as another possible predator. i'm also tired of trembling when i hug a new woman for the first time.

it's time to bury this all down deep, along with the heart i feel i can no longer share. i'm just damaged goods now.

edit: i really didn't expect anyone to read this. thank you for the very positive (mostly) responses and messages. thank you so much for the gold and silver.

i am in therapy and ""doing the work"". i'm just not going to share this with others. what my mother did was something neither wife could accept, and judging on some comments here and some ""lovely"" pms, many can't understand how what happened to to me was possible a few months back.

i looked into prosecution, but despite living in a liberal state, i live in a conservative town, and they would do nothing. she also has a friend on the force. getting ridiculed by the police isn't going to help me.

i do have an ex girlfriend that is there for me. she is literally the only woman that i can be touched by. she knows and is supportive. it helps on the rare occasions our schedules cooperate. we aren't compatible as partners, but being held sometimes by someone i do trust really helps.

i'm just going it one day at a time, putting on the fake smile and living as best as i can. i'm working to be able to trust again, but it will be a long time.

edit 2: i am overwhelmed. my whole life has been rejection and pain, to pull myself up and get knocked down again by this event i wrote about. thank for the platinum, golds and silvers. thank you for seeing me. thank you each and every one of you. i don't feel brave, just honest. over 5000 people see me, and hundreds have reached out.

thank you doesn't even cover it. the world feels a little less cold today.

final edit (2019-02-19): thank you for all the support. i wrote this post to just put it out there one last time, and then pretend it never happened and try to move on. i am pleased that it meant so much to so many people, and so many reached out. i'm going to do my best to heal from this and move on in a positive way. i never thought more that 7500 people would care, as i didn't think anyone would, or even see my post.

to answer a couple last questions in comments.

i did freeze, which is why i didn't throw her off. in the back of my head i still had the notion of not wanting to hurt a woman. obviously, i would have acted differently if i realized what was happening. i was raped. i don't really care if you believe it, but it happened.

also, to the ugly and hateful comments that have started appearing in my inbox. i couldn't care less about karma or attention. i didn't do this for that. i did that to cry out one last time and then remain silent. i didn't expect this response and it's given me a sense of validation i never expected. i'm sorry that a few of you want me to kill myself and delete this post. i'm sorry that a few of you call me insulting and degrading terms. i have given out all the reddit coins to people who posted elsewhere for people like me. i'm not letting you bring me down, nor am i deleting this post. i want what i went through to be known for the next guy that has the same thing happen, and all of the wonderful, supportive and even loving comments i received to be shared.

to prove i don't care about my karma, i'm deleting my account, to silence those ugly, cowardly voices that lurk in hateful private messages.

thank you again, to the vast majority of you. i will never forget how whole and seen you helped a broken man feel.",12
"i just went on a date with a guy who tried to rob me.. i can't possibly tell anyone i know about this story, so here it goes:

two years ago, i returned home from my father's funeral. as soon as i opened the door to my apartment, a guy holding a crowbar came out from my kitchen holding my tv. i live in the city, so robberies are common. 

the guy began shouting at me and he clumsily dropped my tv and began holding the crowbar like it was a baseball bat. i was so stunned at what was happening that i didn't move. 

the guy screamed at me to empty my pockets. from the stress of the last few days with my father passing away, i simply started crying. not out of fear at what was happening, but because this was literally the worst time of my life. the worst moment. the worst minute and second. 

while crying hysterically, i gave the guy my wallet. i just sat on my floor and hugged my knees and told him, through my tears, to ""take whatever you want."" he hesitated, looked down at me. he dropped my wallet and sat down beside me. immediately, he began to comfort me. he began to apologize. he put my tv back on the table and told me it wasn't damaged. he told me that he lost his job and that his mom needed medicine that he couldn't afford and that they were homeless. 

he told me all of this while i just wailed; i cried for my father, who was lost, i cried for my future, for it was uncertain, and i cried because my home had been intruded on in the most violent way. 

for a good 10 minutes i sat in the floor with a guy who had every intent to rob me, telling me that it would be okay and that he was sorry. he begged me not to call the police. i just started screaming at him to get out. 

he ran away so fast that he left the crowbar. i threw it after him as he ran down the street. 

two days later, i came home from work and he was sitting in front of my door. i was so terrified that i pulled out my phone, but he had this look on his face of--i'm not sure how to describe it--remorse, regret? he told me that he told his mom what he did, and his mom made me some soup. he handed me this tiny bowl wrapped in tin foil. again, i was stunned and overwhelmed and angry that i slapped the bowl out of his hands and it shattered on the floor. i told him to leave or i was calling the police. he left. i remember he looked upset. i left the soup and shattered bowl outside my door, almost as a warning for him to not come back. 

about three months after that, i got a note in my mail slot from the guy. he told me his mother had passed away and that he was no longer homeless and that he had a job. he wanted to repay me for breaking into my apartment. he wrote down his address and told me that i was welcome to break into his place if i wanted, but he didn't have much stuff. 

this all overwhelmed me. i threw away the letter, but i remembered his address. i remember walking by there one day, out of curiosity. it was a ratty apartment building across the city. he was walking up to his room and he saw me. he waved. i turned away and left. he ran after me, apologized again. told me that he never meant to do what he did. he showed me the program from his mother's funeral that he kept in his wallet. he wasn't lying, she was real. he was real. he was a real person. 

i don't know what it was, but i believed him. we slowly began to grow together as people? i can't describe it. 

after a year of maintaining communication and learning about who he was, he enrolled in a local community college and began taking courses to earn credits before applying to university. i helped him study for his history class a lot. he's great at math and science, though. 

i never invited him over to my apartment, however. no matter how much i got to know him, i was still afraid of him. and he knew that. he knew that i couldn't trust him. 

but tonight, we went out for coffee because he said he had an exam in his world civ class. when i got there, he said he forgot his book. we just talked for a bit, we laughed, and then he told me he wanted to cook for me. on a whim, i decided to invite him to my apartment. after picking up some things from the grocery store, he came over. i was so nervous that i was shaking. he noticed, he squeezed my hand, and then he made dinner. 

it was amazing. we talked, we laughed, we sat in the floor and watched a movie on the tv he tried to steal. we made jokes about it. 

and then he told me that he missed his mom. i gave him a hug. then he left. 

i don't know what i feel, but i do know that i can't give up on people anymore.

some people just have the shit end of life. maybe things have a way of working themselves out?  

and i miss my dad, too. 

**edit/update** i am...beside myself to log on this morning and see this at the top of this page. i have been a redditor for a few years, but never thought this would happen. also, to those of you who are messaging/commenting to confirm the validity of this--i guess it never occurred to me when i wrote this that it sounded so... ridiculous? it really does, i don't blame you for saying it's false, but it's real. he's real. i'm real. it all happened/is happening currently. thank you all who have messaged me and commented! and thank you to the two people that gave me gold--this is just insane to me. i'm so grateful, so very grateful.

**edit 2** sorry for neglecting this; today has been insane with work and hosting a friend's bridal shower. i want to clarify a few things about this, because i am getting a *lot* of messages about a lot of different things. 

* people are saying that i am being too ""trusting"" of him after what happened. you're right, i suppose. i mean, i live in the heart of one of the most dangerous cities. my friend was robbed just a few years ago and was actually physically injured as a result of it, so me ""trusting"" him did not constitute me giving him a hug after he broke in. it was much, much more than that. 

* my dad died of a brain aneurysm in march 2013. he passed away peacefully in his sleep. the thing about my dad, though, was that he was the most generous, most kindest man in this world. i know people like to say that about their parents, but it's true about my dad. when i was 4, i remember him giving these guys a ride from prison--they were released after serving their sentence, but had to walk to get to where they were going. my dad picked them up, had them hop in the back of his pick-up truck, and took them home. he put his life, and basically mine, at the hands of these people who could have hurt us. they didn't, thank god. my dad taught me to be selfless and understanding of the world, and of people, and i loved him for that. but when i lost him, it shattered me and turned me into an entirely different person. 

* after my dad died, i became severely depressed and angry. i was angry at everything. i had to take a leave from my job (i teach second grade). all day, i would lay in bed and think about how much i hated god--or whatever higher power--for taking my dad away. nothing seemed worth it. after the guy--my *friend*--broke into my apartment, i hated him for a while. i hated my dad for making me so trusting (because i didn't call the cops on the guy). i hated my dad for dying, i hated him for being so incredibly compassionate and better than me. i hated myself for being vulnerable. i just hated everything. 

* the guy who tried to rob me is a person. and of course, i constantly ask myself when i'm with him, ""what happens if he tries to hurt me? or rob me again?"" but the thing about him is that--he *knows* i'm thinking this, and he constantly tries to reassure me. we have grown together as people, as i said. there's a whole two years that i didn't post in this recounting because it would be like a novel-length post. do i ""like"" him? i don't think so. i don't think he ""likes"" me. i think we both understand, respect and honor the other for our mutual struggles. we're proud of each other, and we're both guilty of things. me for shutting out my friends, family and students and becoming an awful person after i lost my dad, and him for going to incredible lengths to try and save his mother from experiencing incredible agony in her final moments. 

* i intend to show him this post. i want him to know. he doesn't have a computer or internet, but i think he'll find this humorous. his story is not mine to tell; how his mother died is not my story to tell; what exactly drove him to pry open my front door with a crowbar is not for me to tell; what happened to his family is not for me to tell. but what is for me to tell is that he is a human; he is flawed; god, he's so flawed. but after knowing him, and learning about his life--about his childhood and the tiny little child who used to be so passionate about school and learning as he was, as he told me, i know that he has his story. i have my story. you have yours.  

* and although i think it is irrelevant, the thought of even dating after the last few years hasn't crossed my mind. was i involved in relationships prior to my dad's passing? yes. one was long-term and had a foreseeable end with an engagement, but things happen. life happens. 

i'm meeting with him tomorrow at his work, while he's on break, to give him some old study materials that i have from a literature class i took in college. it's all so normal, and i'm not afraid. my dad was never afraid, so i shouldn't have to be. i choose not to be. ",12
"just made an app that got me (21m poor college student) a job offer starting at 70k and nobody to tell about it. so i made an app for a friend that works for one of the usa's largest companys because their network team had a mess to clean up that would've taken well over 1000 hours. the company's vendors kept saying it was impossible and couldn't be done, so i said i'd give it a shot.

i made the app in about 8-10 hours, handed it over, and today they offered me that! right now i'm making $15, so this is huge.

the sad part is i wanna tell someone how excited i am, but my one friend already knows, and i don't have anyone else, but i'm so pumped you guys have no clue.

edit: thanks for the support everyone! i really appreciate it all! i wish i had the time to respond to all of you!

also - the app basically parsed 8 million lines of a file pulling info that they needed from arbitrary points in the file and organizing it into an easy, human readable format so that instead of searching through this file for info specific to subnets and certain ip's, they can type in the source and destination or subnet and copy and paste it to clear up their network traffic. they said even if it took a few minutes to pull the info they'd be ecstatic. it only takes 4 seconds. haha, they couldn't believe it.

basically their network was teetering on the edge of destruction and they needed a way to find how they could extract the information within 10 days so that they could fix it before this company lost millions of dollars a day. sorry for the vagueness, but we broke a lot of security protocols so i could build this. but the company didn't mind once they saw it worked. 😁",12
"my coworker died this morning and i'm actually pretty glad about it.. i'm the only person in my office under 50. when i first started everybody told me to watch out for this guy. he was pretty open about his constant drinking and smoking (cigarettes and marijuana) and had a very abrasive personality. for some reason though i liked him right away, and i think he liked me too, he told my supervisor he thought i was smart. 

he used to yell and just rage at everyone, call them names, call them stupid and every creative insult that you can think of. was not that good of a guy to almost everyone. but it was never directed at me, the bright eyed and bushy tailed woman right out of college. the one time he gave me guff was when i asked for his advice because there was a problem in his department, and when he started in on me i immediately said ""i don't have time for this shit,"" and left his office and went back to the situation i was handling. and it got handled. he never said a mean word to me again and i heard through the office grapevine later that he really respected me for that. 

well, all that drinking and smoking and stress of being an asshole caught up to him, i guess. he found out he had cancer and it got bad fast. he changed a lot- i think it hit him that his time was running out, but too late. i think he alienated just about everyone but me, i was one of the only people that spoke to him on friendly terms. i even brought him some of my favorite books to read during his chemo treatments. one day at work a few months ago he collapsed and never came back. and i got word from my supervisor in an email that he died this morning. 

one of the first times i was warned about him was when i was brand new and having lunch with another coworker at chili's, and we spotted him at the bar throwing back margaritas. she made it sound really scandalous but i didn't care. let the man have a nice lunch break, geez. i saw him there a few more times over the years on especially hard work days. 

so today on my lunch break i went to chili's, threw back a margarita and had a steak in his honor. 

i'm glad he's gone. he was a really unhappy man and you could tell he was in an unimaginable amount of pain at the end. if there's anything after this life, and i believe there is, i would like to think he's pain free and being an asshole to some rookie angel who isn't doing their job right. rest in peace, man.",12
"i'm still human so please treat me like one.. i'm a slow person not considered disabled, just slower. i learn slower, i do things at a slower pace. i'm just as frustrated as you are when i'm taking too long to count change to give to a cashier or trying to formulate a sentence to express what i need to. i still have eyes and ears. i can see the eye rolls and heavy sighs when you're too impatient for me to try to do what i need to. i hear those whispers and giggles you make at my misfortune, making fun at how dumb i look trying to read something off a menu. sometimes i go home crying because i know i'm not normal. i know i'm being made fun of. i'd give anything in the world to not be a burden on others, causing stupid issues that usually no one else does. please stop bullying me because i really am trying my best. i'm still human so please treat me like one.


edit: all i can say is wow everyone. i never expected this much attention. my phone was blowing up during easter and i was crying so much while reading the comments. i read every single one and heard every word each of you said. i'm very touched and blessed you took your time to read and respond. i wanted to touch on each topic people brought up and respond on my view on everything.

to those who said you love me, want to be my friend, hug me, any other way of showing that love, i love you too! thank you for, well, being you. :)

to those who did admit to doing some things and view this as an eye opener, thank you for correcting yourself. patience and understanding of people not in your situation can be a little tough, i get that. take away and use this eye opener in all different aspect of life and different situations. view through the other's eyes, you'll see wonderful things.

to those that would stand up for me, encourage me to take my time, even just give me a smile, it helps out. i start to know i have support, i don't have to rush anymore. support in any situation can make a huge difference!

to those saying it's probably just anxiety, i am going to somewhat agree with you. when the moment comes and you know you're going to struggle, it does cause anxiety. i'm usually not anxious till i have that feeling of dread. people's judgements and negative reactions cause more anxiety, ultimately making it worse.

to those who comment on my writing skills, commenting on i should write a book, thanks! haha!  maybe someday!

to those who are just like me, are in somewhat similar situations, ever felt that way, know someone like me, read the comments. it may not be directed at you, but it's about you/your loved one. it's about us. it's about our community, humanity. there are such wonderful people in this world, too. breathe it in. see the support, love and hope people bring. take this with you. love yourself because people love you too. :)",12
"my brother and i are adults and we still have our own ""secret christmas"" in his bedroom every christmas morning.. i just had to tell someone because this is so fucking cute and nobody cares.

my brother and i are several years apart.  growing up, we would wake up on christmas morning before our parents and eagerly lie awake in bed waiting for it to be ""okay"" for us to come downstairs for presents.  so at one point we remedied this by giving each other our presents for one another as soon as we woke up (usually at like 7 am) so we could enjoy christmas early.  we started doing this at like elementary school age.

i am thirty years old and super excited for my early christmas with my brother.  last time we did it, my husband stayed in bed while my brother and i exchanged gifts like little kids at 7 am.

i hope that we both live long lives and continue to do this when we're 80.  it's so cute and makes me cry just thinking about it because it's so adorable.  (also i have my period rn so everything makes me cry)",12
"my dad used to put a little sugar in my spaghetti. when i was little i had a huge sweet tooth, and i loved my dad's spaghetti because he put a little sugar in my tomato sauce so i'd like it better. last week my dad visited me and brought me spaghetti for dinner. i put it in my fridge and forgot about it for a few days until a couple of nights ago. i was extremely sad the other day, to the point of thinking about some very not so good things. i wanted something quick and easy to eat, so i warmed up my dad's spaghetti, and for the first time in years i tasted the sugar in the tomato sauce. i know it's stupid and it may seem really small, but i've really been struggling with major depressive disorder for years now, and knowing that my dad loves me and still tries so hard to make me happy brings tears to my eyes.

edit: thank you very much for all of your kind words! good dads are special people, and i hope this post helps everyone remember a good memory with someone they love. 

edit 2: i've also seen a lot of comments saying that putting sugar in spaghetti is common. i didn't know this, since my mom likes her spaghetti very savory and she's never done this. i've also never had sweet spaghetti at a restaurant or any other public place. i'd like to say that i am not trying to be special by saying that my dad did this, but rather that it meant a lot because he'd make a batch for him and my mom that was more savory, and then a batch for me that was sweet. it's very touching that he still does this years later because he remembered how much i like it. thank you to everyone for pointing this out :) everyone should have the joy of eating sweet spaghetti.",12
"we keep people alive way too long. it's inhumane. it's expensive. nobody talks about it.. i work in an ""old person"" home. 

there are many people here who haven't recognized their family members for over a decade. there are people here who scream and cry every day in confusion and misery.  there are people that are so depressed they won't talk.

and for this honor? people are paying tens of thousands of dollars a year. some even more. 

from a humanitarian perspective - this is insane.  unnaturally prolonging life  to squeeze as many miserable days out of the body as you can. 

christians who argue that these people must be kept alive to not interfere with god's will drive me insane. tell me what is ""natural"" about feeding someone through tubes and dosing them up with 50 pills a day? how is that more natural then, you know..... naturally letting someone die. my god, i don't understand religious people. 

faith teaches mercy and to not be cruel. how people can ""study"" for their entire lives and arrive at the conclusion that keeping someone alive in these circumstances is the right answer is beyond me.

from the financial perspective - i don't even see how this is an issue. this is a horrible, horrible, horrible waste of resources. the cost to keep one person, who doesn't even know where they are, alive for 1 year could house and feed a family of four for a year.

don't tell me there's no money for mental health services. there is. we're just spending it in the wrong place.

no one talks about this stuff. not democrats. not republicans. it's an uncomfortable conversation, but we need to have it.

but we won't. because:
- there's a lot of money to be made off these people
- it's uncomfortable
- it will lose votes

edit : *some ranting

edit 2: i'm not abdicating for ending one's life against their will. i'm saying that people should be able to pass when they think its time. and if someone is too far gone to even understand the question and they live each day in misery, then maybe it's time.",12
"after what he did i am going to marry this man even if i have to ask. 3 nights ago a human being changed my world forever. this is a little long but please read it's heartwarming. his name is shane and i can't believe i found him. we've been dating for about 4 months now and every day seems to be better then the last. from his sense of humor, to his amazing interests to his warm smile he's wonderful and quite sexy imo lol.but it wasn't until 3 nights ago that i realized how in love with him i am because of a single act of kindness. 

we were having date night and he's trying to suprise me with a salsa class. he heard me say on our first date i always found dancing amazing and wanted to be a ballet dancer when i was young but i never got the chance. now at 29 i figure salsa or something would be more fun. so he decided to sign us up and we would begin classes. on our walk we were about to get on the subway until it happened.

now another thing i love is shane listens so well and really gives a crap and after 4 months most guys would stop fully trying especially after some sexy time but not him. anyway i was talking and i kept noticing he was looking over at someone not listening. finally he said i'm sorry babe can u give me a second i need to check something.

he walks over to a young girl maybe 19-20 years old who was crying on a bench in the subway. i didn't hear him at first but i could see in his body language he was trying to calm her and help as 100 other people walked by and i would of done the same. as i approached i realized she was homeless for some time and all she had was a single bag. she said to him all i want to do is go home. he asked where she lived and it wasnt even in the city. she'd broken up with her bf who was gone and i am sure she was on drugs at some point but she also looked down on her luck. either way she was i need and looked scared.

so in this moment many would either hand some money over or wish her luck or maybe let her make a call. shane did much more. he pulls me aside looks me right in the eyes and says ""kelly i can't leave her here like this. i know it's weird but i've been really down before to and sometimes people just need someone to not only help but believe they're telling the truth. he said would u mind if postponed and help her?i said of course n so the journey began. 

we went to 2 women's shelters with her and to no avail they weren't taking anymore people. it was a bit cold and well we're not the richest people with our student loans so we really couldn't afford to pay for a hotel room in the city. so shane with his trusting heart of gold says would i mind spending the night at his place and asking her to stay with us. he figured she would feel comfortable with a girl asking her if she'd like to spend the night and we'd figure it out in the morning. 

i mean here i am with a guy i'm starting to fall for and he's willing to bring a stranger in for the night out of the cold. when i asked her she truly weeped and thanked me a million times but little did she know it wasn't my idea and honestly i'd of never of done this. but he has this gravity about him that just pulls you in. 

we get to shane's house and i have some clothes there so i gave her some stuff the would fit and let her get a shower. in the meantime shane ordered pizza and when she came out he made her feel so cozy like he'd known her for 100 years. we ate pizza, we played a board game, we laughed and then he made her hot tea and we watched his favorite movie the big lebowski lol. he made the couch up for her and we went to bed.

in the morning he made us all breakfast and then told us he'd be right back. he said he was getting us good coffee lol. he comes back and she was finally able to get a hold of her sister on someone's phone in her home town and she had a place to go. shane drives her to the bus station and buys her a ticket and hands her an envelope. here i found out, when asking where it was today, he'd gone down to the pawn shop and pawned his ipad to give her 120 bucks to get home 

this man gave his home, his time, his care, his money and his food to a complete stranger. he trusted her that she wanted to go home and just needed help. he changed how i view the world and in that moment i fell so deeply in love with him. i don't even know how to show him what this meant to me but i know i will become more like him. i love you shane with all my heart and one day i am gonna marry you, give you babies and grow old with you. knights in shining armor still exist and i am lucky enough to get to kiss one whenever i want.

"today my depressed mom finally took a shower and i spent 3 hours brushing the matt out of her hair.. title says it all really. it took so much not to cry while doing it but i'm so proud of her. i feel like we're closer now. 

just needed to get this off my chest. i love my mom.

edit: wow i didn't expect this to blow up at all. thank you all so much for the support for both myself and my mom. i've seen some comments that made me a little sad so to clear some things up:

1. i'm 25 so people can stop stressing that i'm 'too young' to deal with this. i'd have done the same thing at 12 though so 🤷‍♀️
2. i offered to sort her hair out - she did not ask and i did not feel forced too. i wanted to help her. 
3. she's had depression for most for many years and generally copes well, she's just having a really tough time right now with serious health issues and other things i'd rather not go into on the internet. she gets the help she needs. 
4. i have also suffered with depression in the past and she has been there for me every step of the way and has done similar things for me. 
5. i have a great support system so please stop worrying about me

the final thing i'd like to add is that my mom is not a burden. to those of you who have told me to get out or that she's toxic i'd like to say i'm happy for you. you must not have suffered with mental health issues or had someone close to you suffer with them. you're one of the lucky ones. i would never abandon my mom when she needs me regardless of any effect it might have on me. i hope you never have to suffer through you or a loved one going through depression but i do hope that you learn some empathy and kindness.",12
"gillette commercial ad. what the fuck.  so i've (21m) been hearing a lot of things about the ""controversial"" gillette ad these past few days.  i usually don't pay attention to this kind of thing but the video popped up while i was browsing youtube.  1.1 million dislikes over ~600 k likes.  now seeing this i thought to myself ""wow, how controversial can an ad get to have more dislikes than likes?"".  so naturally i watched the thing.

it's a video telling you to behave like a decent fucking human being.  why the fuck are people so mad about this?  if you're mad over this fucking ad, that tells me a lot about your shit personality.  if this ad personally offended you, i can tell what kind fucked up shit you probably did to your peers.  there is nothing controversial about this.  in the video there's a father stopping a child from getting bullied.  there's a man stopping his friend from cat-calling a woman.  there's a man de-escalating a situation.  

the only people that would find this controversial are the misogynistic neck beards that are going to have to ""find"" another razor company to tame their filthy facial fecal hairs due to all the bullshit they're sprouting.

so gillette, as a college male i still find your razors pretty over-priced, but i really hope you don't apologize for that ad, because i think it was great fucking message.

"i just got accepted to an university. just please, anyone, tell me you're proud of me.. my mother always told me to not get my hopes up. she told me to expect that i won't get accepted, she told me to plan for the worst. i applied to 10 schools, and this is the second year that i've applied to schools. last year, i got denied by 5 schools. the odds were against me. i had an 1.9 (transfer) gpa last year, a 2.1 this year but with much better grades + extracurriculars. i got into two above-average schools with 60-70% acceptance rates, and i guess i'll find out soon who else accepted me. 

my so and i are fighting right now over stupid bullshit and honestly he doesn't give a fuck right now. i'm crying out of happiness and drinking at 11:53 because i just got an email from another school tonight saying they accepted me. i'm important. i'm valid. everyone was fucking wrong. i can do this. i'm important. i'm moving out-of-state and i'm going to show everyone how fucking amazing i am since someone, or, more, a higher institution, gave me a fucking chance unlike the people who are supposed to fucking support me. fuck you to anyone who didn't think i could do this.

edit: holy fuck! the comments and the reddit platinum/gold! there's so much. i'm getting really choked up. i wasn't expecting this. jesus. thank you so so much. you all are the real mvp for just taking 2 seconds out of your day to tell some sad drinking internet stranger that she's valid. thank you. :( <3",12

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 13 i would start fainting. medical care was a luxury, i mustn't forget that.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 14 my abuser died. horrifically. i celebrated his death, felt elated. felt like a monster because i did…

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 15 we were officially homeless. dependant on the aid of the government and family, only to find both severely lacking.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 16 i fell in love, but i never learned how to talk. never learned how to say ´´i love you´´. as such many things would remain unspoken.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 17 someone fell in love with me, but i couldn't believe it when he told me he did.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 18 i would know the sting of betrayal, in part because i was incapable of warmth or intimacy. on the surface i looked indifferent, strong perhaps. on the inside i crumbled.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the time i was of legal age, i felt exhausted…

by the age of 19 i moved cities. to put more distance between me and my past.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 21 i picked up life. i was close to my first graduation. my professor committed fraud out of jealousy, and altered my final score. it was uncovered too late. i lost a prestigious job offer because of it.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 22 i would be sick daily. fainting often. i would be diagnosed wrongly.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 23 my first big project as a children's book illustrator remained unpaid. i lost financial stability. i was forced to switch jobs.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 24 me and the life i carried within would be in danger during labor. scar tissue prohibited a safe birth. i suffered severe physical trauma. the mental aspect once more, was left unspoken.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 25 i felt sick once more. the wrongly diagnosed illness had rendered my birth control useless. i was expecting twins.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 26 i would be bed-bound within the borders of the mic (maternal intensive care unit) due to early labor. they came early. critical condition. months of nicu, surgeries. followed by years of intensive therapy.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 27 they told me my children would be disabled for life.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 28 i would start slurring words. spots on my brain, minor neurological damage. cause possibly linked to trauma in early life.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 29 i would lose all my friends, and the only figure of stability during my childhood.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

only by the age of 30 was i diagnosed with c-ptsd. i started a therapy course.

i felt ashamed, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 31 i celebrated the holidays in a psychiatric hold. my kids thought mommy was on vacation without them.

i was ashamed. i was hurt. but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

i came home after a few days. and i rebuilt myself. as i did, time and time again.

i never gave up.

&#x200b;

today, i am 32.

today, i felt stronger than ever.

&#x200b;

but then today, a doctor told me i would need a succession of life-altering surgeries soon, for yet another diagnosis…

&#x200b;

i broke once i entered the safety of my car.

i cried once my sunglasses could hide my tears.

i drove, even though it sometimes feels like i'm going nowhere.

&#x200b;

and then…

&#x200b;

then i started singing.

because i remembered that i used to love it.

and i cried. because i don't want to be strong today.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

**edit:** i would like to thank each and every one of you for the kind words and encouragement. i'm moved by the outpoor of love.

i had no expectations when i posted this. i've been a lurker for years, or chickened out on so many writings. i've only pressed sent once before. some people might not understand, but it takes courage actually going through with a post. i hadn't expected anyone to stop and read my lengthy outpoor. i wrote it because i needed to stay focused when my mind went astray. it kept me anchored.

so i'm happy to receive so much positive feedback. i'm enjoying the evening with my children. i will get back to you later.

thank you for the awards and support!

&#x200b;

**edit 2:** for those who have been trapped and grew up with abuse and chronic trauma: don't give up. healing isn't linear. there are no mythical cures. but there is help, and your starting point will be when you feel ready to discover the best version of yourself. and then keep working towards being exactly that, and be proud of your progress.

&#x200b;

**some resources:**

""the body keeps the score"" is the best book on trauma and cptsd (complex ptsd - a variant due to developmental trauma) along with ""the drama of the gifted child"". if you read nothing else, these too should give you all you need. in modalities, a trauma-informed therapist, emdr (r/emdr(https://www.reddit.com/r/emdr)) and neurofeedback (r/neurofeedback(https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofeedback)) are precious life-changing tools.

for those who called me an attention seeker: stop invalidating people in need. i'm at a point in my life where i'm strong enough that such remarks have zero effect on me. but others who are still battling to find courage to reach out might read this post. they might be in a crucial and vulnerable turning point in their lives. they might find courage to seek help, right up to a point where someone just has to invalidate them as such. those comments make them afraid to be invalidated again, to be called a liar again. they are afraid to be told to suck it up again. it silences victims seeking help because they fear to be just that: attention seekers, not people in real need. but they are people in need. people who suffered chronic trauma need help, compassion, empathy, acceptance. not ridicule, further invalidation or judgement.

&#x200b;

we've been denied help during crucial moments in the development of our lives. as children. it has severe and long lasting consequences, well into adulthood, both physical and mental. seeking out help now is a sign of healing and courage. but kicking people when they are down in a sign of weakness.",12
"my 17 year old brother still talks about (from time to time) about a compliment a girl in his class gave him. it's been 3 months.... 3 months ago i was laying in the bed that was once mine at my parents house when my brother barges in, sits down at the foot of my bed. i dont spend much time around my parents house, nor do i see him very often. but as soon as he walked in i was able to tell by the glow in his confidence and the smile on his face that he was extremely happy. 

my brother is a handsome boi, he has a good social life and has girlfriends in the past. 

so, naturally i asked him what was up, asked what he wanted? 

he smiled, and asked, ""what do you think about my smile?"" i shrugged and told him that i thought it was  fine. ""well"" he said, with a smirk, ""this cute girl in my class told me that she thought i had a very attractive smile!"" 
i didn't really understand why he was so excited..... (really i'm not trying to brag in this next sentence) i thought to myself ""big whoop, i get complimented fairly regularly.""

that got me thinking a little bit.

later that night i knocked on his bedroom door. ""charlie?"" i asked ""when was the last time you were complimented besides today and from a family member?""
there was a little bit of a hesitant pause, but then he admitted that he couldn't even remember the last time he was complimented by someone other than our mother or aunt! 
this got me thinking a little bit more, so i asked my male cousins, my male friends etc etc the same question. most of the responses i got were the same, ""i dont know"" or "" i cant remember"".

still today, every now and then, he talks about how that girl in his one of his classes complimented him on his smile, and it melts my heart how happy that has made him and how much it boosted his confidence.


since then, and after seeing how happy it has made my little brother, i've made it my mission to compliment at least 4 guys a day. whether its on their shoes, their smile, their shirt, their haircut or eyes. 
yes, this has gotten me in some awkward situations where they think i'm hitting on them, but most of the time i see them taken back a little with a smile on their face.  

i think we, as women, take compliments for granted, as it happens to us on a daily basis!!
the message i want to send to people in this post is to just throw a compliment out there from time to time to a guy! it absolutely takes next to zero effort for you, but it may make a huge impact on their day, their week, or month! 


thank you for coming to my ted talk.",12

"my approach to life as it comes to an end.. *edit*

my aggressive cancer is bringing a much swifter end to my life that i was expecting.  last week i had 12 months, maybe more, this week i have 1 month, maybe two.  there is much to cram in, but there is also much to reflect on.  following is my approach to life, my life, a person who has always been positive and seeing the glass half full.  

&#x200b;

put down your phone and have a real conversation

look a friend in the eye and ask them how they *really* are

listen to the wind blowing through the trees above

and marvel at the beauty of a vibrant sunrise

do something that takes you outside of your comfort zone

to prove to you are better than you thought

celebrate your successes, no matter how big or how small

and carve your own path to define who you are

be spontaneous, be unpredictable and importantly, immature

don't be led by narcissist fools that feed on your soul

don't be a slave to their conforming expectations

don't overshare and become fixated with likes and follows

it's false adulation that erodes your own self worth

don't buy things just to impress others, they don't really care

reduce, reuse and repair when you can

be yourself and be proud of it no matter of your orientation

because you being you is the best that you can be


comment:. thank you all so much for you comments and messages.  they mean so much to me and my family and we take great joy reading the positive reaction to my post.  i'll try and read them all and respond but please forgive me if i don't write back.  i'm busy cramming lots of good times in.

"to everyone who saw me shopping today.. thank you for treating me like a normal woman. today was my very first day trying and buying women's clothes and when i first walked into the store i was so nervous and scared. some of you looked away, some of you hesitated to walk near me and some of you didn't notice or didn't care. but not a single one of you made a comment about this transgender woman shopping for clothes.

thank you for making what i thought would be a difficult day such a pleasant experience for me.  
it's ok if you gave me a look of confusion, you don't have to understand.  
i'm just happy none of you said anything about me withing earshot.

thank you for letting me be a woman today.

"my son called me ""mom"" today. my son is four and has autism. for the most part, he's nonverbal. in therapy for the last week or so they've been working on ""mom"" and ""dad""  with him, by showing him photographs of myself and my husband. 


this evening when i went to go pick him up, his therapist brought him out to the truck. she pointed to me and asked him ""who's that?"" he enthusiastically replied ""mom!"" it's the first time i've ever heard him say it. 


i beat myself up a lot of days and always wonder if i'm doing the right things for him. small victories like today make me feel a bit better.

"i tried making my girlfriend pancakes. my girlfriend had a really long week and was tired. i know she likes pancakes and chocolate so i wanted to surprise her with chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast in bed on her day off. i snuck out of bed early and i followed the directions on the box exactly, but i was worried the batter was going to be too thick with the chocolate chips so i added a bit more milk. then it was too runny so i had to add more flour, then it was way too thick. so i didnt want to water it down anymore and said fuck it, but then they werent cooking properly. i also tried to make a heart with the chocolate chips but between the thickness of the batter and geberal spatula fuckery they came out more like scrambled pan muffin egg cakes and there was no heart.

you guys, her face just lit up and she was so happy with my pancake mess. she kept putting her fork down to kiss me and the way she looked at me... like its weird to type but i really feel like im something, or like im somebody you know. it was that same feeling where, i guess i felt really proud of myself for doing something like that, i mean i was pretty shy cause they weren't nice pancakes but she said i made her happy....

i'm sorry for posting this here again. i just really dont have an outlet where i can talk about romantic stuff like this, people around me arent about that kind of thing but really, being with her and doing these nice gentle things...

i love her. it just feels good.

"he texts me at 8:36 every morning.. my boyfriend works a typical 8 to 5 job, monday thru friday. he's always the first to text good morning because i usually sleep in. i've noticed that everyday that he's at work, at exactly 8:36am, he texts me a sweet good morning message. the first two days that i noticed, i thought it was just coincidence, but then for the next week, it was the same thing at 8:36am. now i didn't want to just assume that he had an alarm specifically set for saying good morning to me, but secretly i really hoped. eventually, i looked over his shoulder as he was setting another alarm for a different time and i saw his top alarm was set for 8:35am monday thru friday and is was called ""tell my love, good morning."" 

i still haven't told him i know his cute secret and i'm not sure if i ever will. part of me wants to tell him that i know but another part of me doesn't want to. at least not anytime soon. maybe when we're old and boring and need something to talk about haha. i just wanted to tell someone because it's been something that's been on my mind for months and i just find it so adorable!

"thank you to the customer who didn't answer their door for their food. i work for skip the dishes (food delivery like uber eats or doordash). if someone doesn't answer their door, we call. if they don't answer the call, we message support chat, and wait 7 mins while they try to contact them. if there is no answer after 7 minutes, we can keep the food and leave.

you ordered from subway. a foot long pulled pork sub, and a 6 inch pizza sub. 2 bags of chips, and 1 cookie.

because of you, my family ate today. i was so excited, i ended my shift and drove right home. my boyfriend got half of the foot long and a bag of chips, my son got the pizza sub and half of my half of the footlong, as well as the chips and cookie. i got the remaining quarter of the foot long.

i am the sole provider and we are not doing well. i always short myself to try to get them what they need. i had to spend most of the grocery budget on bills this month just to keep the water on and keep my job. i haven't seen my son so excited in a long time, as he was to get 2 treats with his yummy sandwich.

i always feel bad when someone doesn't get their food. fortunately, the customer gets credit so they can re-order the food again free of charge. i'm sure they were annoyed at me somehow, i normally get bad reviews when someone doesn't pick up their food, despite me doing everything i can, but i wish they knew what it did for me.

edit: for anyone who wants to make rude comments about not having kids if you can't afford them.
first of all, my son was convinced while i was being help captive by the man who kidnapped me. and yes he was charged. i was 16.

second, i'd like to borrow your device that shows you the future since you seem to think someone can tell that in a few years, their stability will be gone due to unforeseen circumstances.

lastly, i hope you are an advocate for abortion and birth control access, not just fake tough online.",12
"i've made bad choices my entire life and now that i have everything together, i'm need to get this off my chest.. both of my parents died when i was young. i was taken in by my best friends family and was raised as their own. his dad was out of the picture and only returned once his mom passed away and from them on i was raised by his dad. 

his dad, thomas was not a bad man but he was stuck around a bad group of people. he was a criminal. he paid our rent by stealing cars, robbing people on the street and so on but by the time i was 14, his luck finally ran out and he was caught breaking into an old mans home and was sent to prison. 

my friend went to live with his grandparents who were unfortunately unable to take me so i had nowhere to go. after my parents died, i lost contact with my family so the only place i could think of was to thomas' criminal friends. to my surprise, they let me stay ask long as i payed rent. the next few years i went from dead end job, to dead end job when i finally had enough. the money just wasn't rolling in so by 18, i turned to crime with them. 

there were 6 of us living in the same house and i was the youngest. they taught me how to steal cars, break into houses and everything. so that's what i did. by 20 years old i've turned into a complete and utter degenerate. i started selling drugs on college campuses. they guys didn't care what i did as long as i had money coming in. 

the next few years were some of my worst. cops were constantly patrolling the streets so i had no way to make money. the guys eventually kicked me out which left me suicidal, they were my family, the practically raised me. 

i spent the next few days in a homeless shelter. i was reading the paper one day and a man had been murdered and robbed out where the guys lived. fearing the worst, i went back to check if any of them were okay and they were. minutes later the cops pulled up and arrested all of us. turns out, one of the guys was the murderer of that poor man o read about. 

i was put in a room and asked questions about the case and i told them nothing until i had a lawyer present. once i did, i told my lawyer everything about my life and those guys and a few days later, he came to me with an offer. if i confessed to everything, i would be put into witness protection and moved across country to start over. 

so i did. 

i was given a small apartment, a shitty car and a dead end job stocking shelves at a grocery store. 

after a few months, i met the woman who i would later call my wife. she knew what i was and didn't care. neither did her family. they actually liked me for whatever reason, i don't know. they paid for my trade school and turned my life around. after a few years of working, i went to her dad with a cheque to pay him back and i asked for his blessing to marry his daughter. 

we got married exactly a year later. 

i'm now 33 and have a beautiful daughter who will be 4 this november",12
"i just got promoted at work and i can't tell anyone in my family because they'll sneer at me. but i'm so proud of myself.. i grew up in severe poverty, with a side of domestic violence. i worked hard and now i have my masters and a good job. i'm 24 and i've only been at my job for 6.5 months. today, i found out that i'm being given an important position on my team, bypassing more senior coworkers, because i am efficient and very good at what i do.

my family kind of glorifies their poverty. they see themselves as tough survivors. they aren't proud of what i've achieved. in their eyes, i've betrayed my past. i'm forgetting where i come from.

but i haven't forgotten. i got out, but i'll never forget. and i'm so fucking proud of myself. i did it. i make good money and i enjoy what i do.

to add another layer of feelings, my ex dumped me about a week and a half ago. he told me that my family issues are too much. my childhood trauma has, of course, affected me as an adult. i'm dealing with it, but he didn't like that i'd talk about it. he didn't like how i chose to deal with it. so now i can't even tell him, my best friend, about my promotion.

but fuck it. i did it. i *finally* feel like i made it out. and my family didn't help me. i did it on my own.

edit: thanks for the outpouring of positivity, everyone! i'm so happy that i've managed to officially defy my family's dream of me settling down and being a stay at home mom, like every other woman in my family. the  support from y'all means a lot. ",12
"the female body is fucking art. if you are attracted to females you understand. its perfectly designed. the hips, the curves, the breast, the bottom, the hair. everything. it is such a treasure. fat or not, skinny or not. short, tall, whatever, it's just fucking beautiful. 

idk if it's the weed talking right now but i'm just staring at my beautiful gf and all these thoughts just came rushing to me. i'm not sure if the male body is viewed in the same light but i doubt it. we just look like bricks. if you are a female give yourself a good look in the mirror and really admire the work of art that is your body, no matter what problems you have with it.

**updated on 8/1/19**

i think i'll use my cake day to update this post.   i can not say thank you enough to the reddit community!!  for years & years i lurked on reddit. i read almost every single day, but i didn't participate much.  i had an old account for several years before i started this new one (which was supposed to be a throwaway account to ask a tricky financial question but i like the name.) as much as i enjoyed reddit i did not understand the spirt of ""the community"" until this post.  i could feel you all when i could not feel much else.  it was eye-opening and amazing and i will forever be grateful to each one of you.

i had more than 200 comments and about as many private messages.  it feels like those messages literally gave me life in the very beginning. i was careful to only read a few dozen a day, trying hard to make the comfort last as long as i possibly could.  i don't have words to say how much comfort i have received from reddit after this post.  i genuinely hope you never understand the depth of my gratitude because that would require you to understand the depth of my misery.  reddit to me was truly miraculous.  and because of you, i was going good!!  like really good!  everyone kept saying it was shock but i knew it was all the love, prayers, support and good thoughts that had come from this post that was keeping me afloat.  i am still positive that is the fact of the matter!

i was rocking widowhood until around week five, then it hit me like a freight train out of control. i completely lost my everlovn' mind.  i stayed slightly insane and more than slightly drunk until my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant about 10 days ago.  im starting to feel sorta human again.  well, human may be an overstatement but i don't feel like i'm completely insane anymore (although subject to change without prior notification.)  


when i finally gave in and went to my doctor it was because i literally thought that i had developed early-onset dementia. for real.  i was so worried about it for two weeks straight.  i just kept thinking omg this can't be happening!  our three (adult) daughters just lost their father and now they're gonna lose their mother to a memory care award or an insane asylum.  as it turns out (fyi tuck this away for the future just in case you might need this information,) but apparently if you only sleep for 2 to 3 hours a night for several weeks straight, you start to lose your cognitive skills.  i had no idea.  i genuinely thought i had gone insane.  

but back to you guys, i'm positive that without this post i could not of gotten through his memorial service.  i tried to write the eulogy for two weeks! i bet i started 60 times!  then the very night before the service (6/29) at like 2am i remember what i had written here.  i took the post, reworded a thing or two and added a bit more and voilà i rocked the eulogy.   

i made it through the whole service without shedding a single tear.  since it was going to be the first time i've met some of our employees in person i did not want to embarrass him by having smudged & streaked makeup  (not that dead people necessarily get embarrassed but you get the jest of what i'm saying.)  i think i would have made him proud. 


i can't believe i'm still standing to be honest.  but i've actually managed to work two whole days in a row!  like full days!  although our company has continued to pay my salary, i've honestly been too out of it to do much. luckily our two partners seem to be understanding.  

i am soooo looking forward to the day we are not every single thing reminds me of him!  tonight a quick trip to walgreens had me near tears because i saw candy corn on the shelf, it was the only candy he would ever eat and only around halloween.!  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

anyway, i just want to say thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart!!  you'll never know how truly grateful i am! 

*also for those wondering, since i did not know for certain when i first posted the coroner's report came in a week or so after his passing:  sudden cardiac event)* 

6/14/19  original post below

                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


my husband died a few hours ago.  

around 5 p.m. on june 14th he went into the bathroom, locked the door and then collapsed.  i heard him fall.  i tried for a few seconds to get the door open but i couldn't.  i called 911 and they got here pretty quickly.   one of the paramedics kick the door in but it was too late.

we both have had some type of bug and had not been feeling well for the last few days.  he had taken some cold medicine so i'm assuming he had a heart attack.  i just don't know for sure.  he was only 57.

it seems strange that his passing would not be a big deal worldwide, like how is cnn talking about politics and not jeff?  the world has lost a truly great man.   a very rare man.  can't you all feel it?  the whole wide world is darker.  jeff was a good, kind, honorable man.  honest to god, he was the smartest man i've ever met.  he was was so sweet and tender-hearted. he loved me like no man has ever loved a women.  he was faithful and funny!! oh my goodness no one could make me laugh like he did.  he was the most quick-witted person ever.  he was a wonderful father, friend, cat daddy...even though he said he hated cats and was super mad every time i added one to the family, only to have him being the head snuggler in a few days.  i went through his phone and he had more pictures of our kitties than he did of even our grand babies. 

several years ago, him and his best friend started a company.  this left him interacting with the often ""chronically"" unemployed as well as heads of government. i always marveled he showed absolutely no difference in his interactions.  the homeless man applying for work was treated exactly the same as the mayor.  no airs, no pretension.  the moment he shook your hand, you were counted as a friend.  just honest simple kindness. 

he had a comfortable friendliness about him that instantly put people at ease. her also had an unexplainable air of authority about him.  people naturally just fell in line behind him.  he was a born leader.  people did what he told them to do, usually without question.  one story that always comes to m mind when i think about his seemingly otherworldly authority that left others comfortable and confident knowing he was in charge and he would handle it.  

recently we had a story in our local news about a child who lost a leg in an accident.   jeff donated the money to provide a prosthetic, on the one condition; you can't tell anyone where the money came from.  we are far from being wealthy.  in fact as little as 5 years ago we were nearly completely bankrupt after he endured a very long medical illness.  every single cent we had was gone.  all of our savings and retirement.  
during his illness his company took the first opportunity to let him go. he was sick and there we were without a dime or insurance.  
  
he got better then set out to open his own company so that he could make sure this particular job and community need was met.  he wanted to provide  the service with integrity.  he did.  by the second year in business he made more money than in the five years combined.  he was a work horse! he gave 200% to every single project and worked sometimes 18-19 hour days. he did it cheerfully because he knew he could help people.  he was such a blessing to everyone who met him. 

i'm a mess.  i'm so afraid and confused.  i don't know how to handle any of this.  he handled everything.  i had a rough childhood, early on it was if his mission in life was to make me happy. he spoiled me, not just with things but with himself.  in all of these years i can't think of a single moment in time that he did not put me first.  

i tried to always had to keep tabs on  him before i called him because i knew that if he was in a meeting or in the middle of a big presentation, it didn't matter if it was with the governor and mayor of the or any combination of bigwigs, if my number popped up on his caller id he would stop the meeting and take my call.   it was so sweet but it was also embarrassing to know you stopped and important presentation just to ask something as simple ""what would you like for dinner?"" i had asked him over and over again to just let my calls go to voice mail if he wasn't alone, even promising that if there ever was an actual emergency i would text him 911 first.  he still answered my call. it always made me feel not just loved but adored.

i called his closest friends to let them know.  i have literally heard more grown men openly weeping in the last day than i ever have in whole life combined.  i'm so afraid of a future without him.  he was my everything.  my whole life has been playing a supporting role to his ambitions.  i don't have any idea how to deal with the finances,  what to do about the brand new truck he bought six months ago.  i don't know what to do about anything and i'm so afraid i can't live without him. but mostly im afraid that i don't want to live without him.",12
"i fucking love people who encourage you to take your time when you're doing something difficult, new, or uncomfortable.. the phrase ""take your time"" is one of the most instantly reassuring and motivating things i've ever heard in my life. it's so simple, but so beautiful; it instantly removes any expectation that you're supposed to know what the fuck you're doing. and it tells you that the person watching you trusts you and sees your struggle for what it is: natural. 

so thank you, people who say that. the world is better with you in it.",12
"i'm 100% going to marry him one day. i was at my boyfriend's flat today, doing some work on my laptop. he had to pop out for an hour to meet a friend, and when he got back he took my breath away. he walked in wearing the same woolly jumper and heavy blue coat that he had on when he left but his cheeks were pinched red by the cold, his bright orange hair was messy from the wind, and he was holding his travel mug that no doubt had the dregs of a cappuccino in it. as soon as he saw me, he grinned.
he is the most beautiful man in the world in both body and soul, and i knew within a few months that i want to marry him. but today, it turned from a want to a need. i need to be his wife, to be the one to give him happiness, warmth, and safety. i would do anything to see that grin every time he comes home to a shared home one day - our home. in five or ten years, i'd like to see that grin on the face of a fire-haired child, perhaps. and, from the jokes and late-night conversations, i know he feels the same.",12
"i'm finally okay with what i lost.. i had my daughter at sixteen. i'm now in college a year and a half later and a single dad.

losing freedom was the hardest part for me. i couldn't hang out with my friends, listen to shitty music, sleep a full night, study when i wanted. shit, i still can't take a shower without baby invading the tub. she sleeps in my bed every night. i have no personal space anymore. can't even take a bite without her trying to snatch it out of my mouth. class is so hard because she squirms and i can't concentrate, and then i'm too tired to review the notes i managed to make later. i wanted to be an author, i love writing so much, but i think that'll have to be postponed.

i felt like i lost myself and everything i used to be. her mom got to move away and start over, and she's never made an effort to talk to me again. it's just.. hard. i was so angry for a long long time. not at baby, but at myself and everyone else.

but today baby and i went on a picnic at the park. she kept messing up the blanket so i put it away and we sat in the cold grass instead. she liked the grass a lot. i fed her those nasty ass green grapes, which are her absolute favorite. the wind blew her curls around and glued them to her sticky cheeks. for a while i just watched her eat. she hummed at me every time i popped a new bite into her mouth, staring at me with those big brown eyes and that dumb four toothed grin. 

today i realized that i love this baby with every ounce of my fucking being and i'd rather have her. i'm okay with what i lost. i'll never get it back. i can never be as naive and young as i used to be again. i wish i could have had baby ten years from now, but she's here, and i love her more than i loved who i used to be.

she's passed out next to me right now. i'm listening to her breathe. i think that i've never loved anybody so much in my life. it hurts but it's special. something clicked today, and i'm really glad it did. it feels like a million pounds was lifted off my shoulders.",12
"had another interview today, after half a year of searching. this time they made their decision before i left the building. been doing interview after interview over the past 6 or so months. having been displaced from my home state for so long and being stuck surviving on the streets of sf, 2019 thus far has easily been the worst year of my life.

i went in for this interview, coming back to a company whose new york office i had worked at before i came here. i knew some of the questions, but there were some i just barely scraped by on due to how long it's been since i've been able to practice.

after the last question, the project manager and recruiter came back into the room, thanked me, then asked for me to wait in the hall, and that one of them would be out in a moment to take me back to the lobby.

i didn't expect them to make their decision as fast as they did, but they actually called me *back* into the office ""to be straight with me.""

>*""coffee, we admire your resume, as well as your previous work for our company...""*

by this point i already felt my heart pounding and smile drop. i'd already gotten dozens of emails that start with similar lines.

>*""and i personally am thankful for your previous service to our country""*

i smiled and nodded. even under normal circumstances, i always hate being thanked for my military service. i was an it guy, not a war hero.

> *""ordinarily we'd wait until later to come to a decision, however pm and i have enough information at this point to make our decision.""*

back to square one.

> *""and so, we would like to extend an offer for you to return to our company.""*

i think my heart stopped at that point when i processed what he said. by this point they were already going on and asking when i would be able to fill out my employment paperwork and officially start.

six months of homelessness, surviving off of the bare minimum i needed to survive. six months of incredibly unstable living conditions because the company i moved out here for no longer needed the role they hired me for. and now i'm going to finalize my employment next week, at 60k more than what i used to make, in a more senior position.

im gonna go watch avengers to celebrate, because i have been struggling to stay alive, and now i finally have enough peace of mind to think about how crazy the cliffhanger was in the last movie",12
"how relieved i am to hire someone who doesn't need to be trained.. the man just got out of prison after doing 10 years. shows up early for the interview, immediately starts working. don't have to show him anything, he knows our machines (street sweeper trucks) inside and out from past experience and knew exactly what we were the second he saw it. 

didn't say a word to me, until i finally told him he was hired. told me after that he'd been to several different local shops looking for work, was denied due to his stint in prison and was desperate for work. decided he would just show rather than tell. 

he's been working for me for the better part of a month now and is the most knowledgeable, respectable and easygoing guy i've ever met. doesn't complain and works his ass off. gets on with everyone in the shop. hope he sticks around for a while! we're working on getting him his cdl so he can go run jobs for us. 

need a few more good men like him to keep our fleet running strong!",12
"my fiance committed suicide and i can't bring myself to tell our loved ones how everything went down so i'm posting it here.. in may of 2018 my fiance committed suicide. we were together ten years and over the last month or so of his life i had noticed a change in his behavior. he had become more aggressive and hadn't been sleeping very well. i combined the two and figured he was just grumpy from not sleeping. his aggression wasn't physical, he would just pick fights and get extremely drunk like 6 nights a week.

my final straw was one night he came home 5 hours late from work in a complete blackout and screamed at our dog for no reason. he loved our dog and thought he could do no wrong and let him get away with everything so this was way out of the ordinary. the next day when he was sober i talked to him and basically just told him the drinking had to stop because it was affecting his personality, his health, and our relationship. we had a long and, i thought, productive talk. he agreed to stop drinking and he did for about a week.

the day he died he came home early from work, which i thought was strange, and he told me he was going to a coworkers birthday party and he'd be drinking. he didn't even pretend i was invited to come along knowing this particular coworker and i weren't the best of friends. i was irritated and kind of flew off the handle about him drinking again, he took the whole fight as me being pissed he was going out without me. which was not the case.

i told him i wasn't going to sit around and wait for him to come home hammered, that i was going to go out with my friends and i'd see him later, but i was still pissed. before he left he kissed my forehead and said ""i love you."" i replied ""uh huh."" i'll regret that for the rest of my life as it was the last time i saw him alive.

i texted him throughout the afternoon, apologizing for having an attitude and said i hoped he was having a good time and getting to relax with his friends. he never responded. finally at about 1130 i called him and didn't get answer. i called a few more times and finally he picked up. 

i asked him where he was, he said he was at home. i asked him why he hadn't responded to me all day, again annoyed, and all he said was ""i'm at home"". i told him i'd be home in an hour or two and he hung up. when i got off the phone it occurred to me he sounded sober, which i thought was strange considering he was at a party all day and he's never said no to offered booze in his life.

i texted him and asked him if he was going to be up for a bit. his response was ""why did you drink all my beer?"" which i didn't and i told him so. he responded ""nvm idc"". that was the last thing he ever said to me.

i came home about 2 hours later and he had hanged himself. i couldn't get all the way in the door because his body was blocking it. i was able to get my head in and the first thing i saw was our dog cowering in the corner at the end of the hallway. i turned my head to the right and saw his feet, and then his face. the image of the love of my life, hanged, will never leave me. ever. 

i shut the door and stood there for what felt like hours but probably wasn't more than 30 seconds. i called 911 and it seemed like before i could give all the information needed the police were there. a nice officer stood outside with me and gave me water. another officer came down as the medical examiner pulled up and asked me for my dogs name because he had to bring the dog down since he wouldn't let them near the body. 

even though i saw my fiance, and the officer said ""body"" and i saw the medical examiner my brain still thought he'd be ok. it wasn't until i was sitting on the bench outside our apartments, holding my dog, and saw the flash from the me's camera taking pictures of my fiance bouncing off the building across the street that it hit me. that's another image that will never leave me. i looked at the officer that was with me and asked if it was really happening. he nodded sadly and my whole existence exploded. my brain shattered into a billion pieces and i sobbed.

while the officer comforted me the me came out and explained to me that they were bringing his body out now. she recommended i take the dog on a walk around the block so i didn't have to see it.

i turned my back and walked about 5 feet before i heard the stretcher come out. i froze. i didn't turn around, i just stood there holding my dog. when i heard the van door close its like my brain instantly pulled as many pieces as it could back together. i turned around and the me asked me for a lot of information, which i gave cooly and calmly. i then asked her if i was supposed to notify his parents. she said someone from her office could do it but if i felt i could inform them it was always best coming from a loved one. 

i called a friend who came and picked me up. i sat on her couch in a daze for about 20 minutes. then i called my mom. at this point i think shock set in. i was very monotone. i told her what happened and she lost it. i told her calmly i had to let her go because i had to call his parents. it was about 430 am at this point so i had to call repeatedly to wake them up. obviously they were hysterical and i just kept apologizing over and over in a flat monotone voice. his mom asked me where i was and if i needed her to come get me. i told her i was with a friend and i didn't know what i needed right then. 

we hung up so she could call his sister and that's when i shattered again. i lost my entire mind in my friends kitchen.

i went home again to try to sleep but it was nothing but nightmares. for the next 4 months i slept little and ate less. my mind exploded, pulled itself back together, and exploded again over and over and over, intimately rearranging who i was as a person each time. 

9 months later and i've stabilized for the most part. i'm still in the apartment, which became a museum to him for months after his death, but i'm working on putting his stuff away and moving out and moving on with my life. it's not easy. today i found an old hat he had lost years ago wedged way down in his chair and sobbed for about an hour before angrily throwing it away. that's what made me decide to post here, with the hope that just getting it out there will heal me further.

i know leaving the home i shared with the love of my life for ten years will be a new trauma i have to endure, and i can't find hope or happiness right now but i still have curiosity about what's next for me and who i will become when the dust has settled in my heart and i get used to the hole he left.


edit: i wanted to edit this to address some of the comments from people talking about their own suicidal thoughts. i want it to be known i am not angry with him. i was, but i've come to realize that he didn't mean to hurt me or anyone else. he genuinely thought our lives would be better without him. he was incredibly wrong. his thought process and his inability to ask for the help he needed, through no fault of his own, leveled many people. for my part what breaks my heart the most is actually the good things that have happened since he left. those good things break me more than that one night because he isnt around to experience them with me. we spread his ashes where he used to camp with his family when he was little. the area is beautiful and he and i never went. he didn't get to see the look of awe on my face at the mountains and rivers we saw. he didn't get to hold my hand next to one of the most beautiful scenic spots imaginable. knowing that i will have beautiful moments in my life but cannot share them with him is heartbreaking on an indescribable scale. 

the people around you love you, and want you around. you make their lives better. the problem with addiction and depression is that they are twin liars who convince you of all the negative things you think about yourself. don't listen to them. there's always something new coming, always a new chance to thrive.

edit 2: u/spectralhues pointed something out and i want it to be visible as well. if you or someone you know is struggling with alcoholism do not attempt to quit cold turkey. the withdrawls can kill you. my fiance struggled with alcohol abuse throughout his life and our relationship. while i know for a fact he was able to go a day or two he could have, and probably did, lie to me about consuming alcohol when i was not around. if you feel you have this issue i encourage you to seek professional, supervised help. again, do not try to quit cold turkey.

"i'm turning 90 in october and i'm truly and earnestly terrified to die.. i'm not ready. i don't want to die. i feel like i'm the only person my age that wants to live. i have my health, my independence and am in great shape. all my elderly friends are all prepared to die. they say once you hit 90 it's anyday....anyday. i like seeing my great grand-kids, i like drinking, i like being retired and doing whatever i fucking want. i want to spend the next decade living life to the fullest. i've only just retired recently after working myself to death for 89 years. 

i think about it constant. every ache, ever pain i feel is this going to kill me? i fear everyday i'll die in a hospital in a vegetative state shitting my self or worse live as a senile old man. i want to die as a man should, free. but, most importantly i want to live long. i want to see my great great grandkids, i want to see the future. i love living in this day and age. i've always been tech savvy and theres so much going on it's truly exciting. 

nobody understands my desire to live. people just assume once you get old you're ready but, it's not true. death is final, death is scary. ",12
"thank you to the hotel maid who heard my cries through the wall. today i experienced one of the greatest acts of kindness from a complete stranger. the past 2 months have been quite difficult for me. i lost two dream job opportunities, almost lost one of my siblings, and have half lost the love of my life. i've managed to get over the first 2 items, but every day i can't help but to feel sad that someone that i love so much is so easily able to not love me as much in return. more so, i can't help lift the feeling that i clearly didn't mean that much to him. today was a tough day and i cried in my hotel for nearly half an hour before i heard a knock on the door. before i could ask her to come back, she spoke through the door asking if i was okay. when i opened, she said she could hear me from the other room and asked if i needed anything before offering to keep me company on her upcoming break. she left for 15 minutes, only to actually return

i cannot stress how much this act of kindness positively impacted my day. her english was quite broken, which oddly enough made me feel better. my mother herself only speaks spanish with a bit of broken english intermixed, and i've yet to tell her i'm gay. talking today with a stranger felt like i was able to have the conversations i'm not able to have with my own mother and it brought a lot of happiness out of me. we talked for nearly her entire break, and even shared some food. none of which she needed to do, but chose to do out of the kindness of her heart

i wholeheartedly hope that anyone reading this gains the encouragement needed to aide those in need, even if you don't know them. you have so much potential to change someone's day. don't let it go to waste.",12
"my 4 year old son is autistic and i hate him. i hate being a parent. i hate everything about this.. i am so tired of having to ""deal"" with it all. the tantrums, the lack of comprehension, the aggression, and the inability of us being unable to do anything or go anywhere because of him. i. hate. my. son.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of people will hate me for this but i truly just want to get this off my chest without anyone who knows me knowing. i want to finally spill all the beans and get it out there and i'm hoping this will be cathartic for me. i already know i need personal mental help: alas no monies for that. people will also suggest getting him help as well: no money for that either, though he already is in a local state sponsored 2.5 hour daily program for kids with disabilities. it's helping, but it only goes so far.

&#x200b;

there are many things i despise in the world from politics to health care (or there lack of) to business practices to just people in general. i also love many things around here, so no ... i'm not a grumpy old man who just hates anyone and everything. there are even people i'd be oh so happy to see suffer a slow and painful death. but there is one thing i would never wish on even them: a child with autism.

&#x200b;

i'll start off by saying i truly don't know how single parents and happy/good parents with kids with disabilities do it. i truly do not understand how you have so much strength to get through the day and still be in one piece mentally. i wish i knew how.

&#x200b;

today all i wanted to do was something seemingly simple and it even started off well. go fuel up the car, then walk around the block a bit to get coffee. he had fun in the car, but as soon as the car right was over and we had to go left instead of going right the tantrums, screaming, scratching, pinching and all started. he wanted this instead of that: more tantrums. right instead of left the next time. and worse and worse. all i wanted was a damn cup of fresh coffee that i didn't have to brew myself.

&#x200b;

we (wife and i) work from home, and a decent amount of time we have to spend ""dealing"" with him. i use that word specifically as it's not the ""oh cool, that's a cool car you have! let's play a bit!"" .... not that kind of stuff. it's the ""for the thousandth time, do not stab the dog with the stick"", ""please play with the bouncing ball not against my head ... again"", ""we've talked about this a million times, do not touch the audio equipment"" and on and on and on. i'm getting tired of having to repeat the exact same very simple things over and over and over day in and day out.

&#x200b;

you might say, ""but dadwithautistickid, kids don't understand stuff you have to be nicer to them. they'll get it!"" ... i hear ya. but there is only so many times at this stage you can repeat the simplest of things without getting frustrated. be it how to put on shoes (just putting them on, not tying them), we need to go right instead of straight, this is how we go up stairs, please wait here for 5 seconds while i order coffee ....

&#x200b;

i'm tired. i should never have been a dad. this truly has been the worst decision of my life and i regret everything about it. save for a few minor points here and there, these four years have been horrible and only getting worse and it's largely because of him.

&#x200b;

logically speaking, it's not because of him it's just my perception and view of the world in which i cause myself to get angry on things that i should not such as his inability or ability to comprehend differently than us. logically, sure. emotionally .... emotionally this took a hour type up.

&#x200b;

i'm trying to get better. i'm trying not to get mad. i'm trying not to yell at him. i just can't help but be frustrated and yell at him sometimes. i know it's wrong, and there is no excuse for me acting the way i am. i feel like shit for yelling at him and dragging him home while he was wailing because he wanted to go 'that way' and i wanted to go home so i can go back to work. he doesn't understand the stressed of work, of time, of other people's desires/needs. i understand he doesn't comprehend most of what we're doing (both because of age and because of his autism).

&#x200b;

and it breaks my heart seeing all these normal kids his age doing normal things and he just don't ""get it"" and probably never will. i feel like a failure for having a kid like that. i feel like a failure for not being a better and good enough father, parent and man to be able to help him properly.

&#x200b;

i just don't.

&#x200b;

we're currently back home and to try to make it up to him he's gotten some hugs, some of his favorite juice and i turned on his favorite lego game. so whoever you people are at nintendo and lego who make your games accessible to kids: whoever you are thank you very much. without you i don't know what i'd do. the lego games are always fun, and we figured he'd like the lego city game ... and he adores it. it's the first real video game he's played and pretty much first thing other than just cars and trains he's truly ""played"" with. thank you. and yes for those wondering: he and i do play it together sometimes in the evenings or weekends.

&#x200b;

as for now, i'm going to go sit in a corner, drink my coffee and cry and think about how shitty of a dad i am. am i the worst father out there: no. that type of comparison doesn't help me. no matter what, i always end up comparing myself to parents with ""normal"" kids. my wife already knows what i think of him, though she doesn't know i ""hate"" him. she will never know. whatever i do i know i need to be better and do better.

&#x200b;

at least to round this off on a few positive notes: writing this out has helped clear my sinuses out a bit as well as being a good load off of my shoulders. the school program he is in has helped immensely since he has started as he's now able to put several words together into a mini sentence with some prompting and direction. he is getting surprisingly better rather quickly at video games, so i hope to find more he can play soon. he does like cars, so i'm going to try to find 'city' oriented ones ... though i hear the new yoshi game it nice. maybe he'll like it, dunno. i think they have a demo to try. my mother helps out sometimes which is amazing when she's able to. and when times are good, things are sometimes kinda fun with him around. i hope he can be both my gaming and hiking buddy in the future.

&#x200b;

thank you for reading.

&#x200b;

evening edit:

&#x200b;

thank you everyone for all your kind words and suggestions. i have never even considered contacting disability services for him, local community (such as church) groups and local fellow 'parents with kids who need help' groups.

&#x200b;

you'll be pleased to know i've given him extra hugs, kind words, snuggles, and playtime. we've both calmed down a lot. many of your heart felt messages truly made me tear up, thank you. tomorrow i'll be looking into local disability services and since it's a day off from school (good friday), i'll take some time off of work and walk around with him (weather permitting) or play a lot with him.

&#x200b;

i will be heading to bed now. thank you all very much. truly. everything you've all written has given me a lot to think about. thank you and good night.",12
"i saw my dead husband in a dream and i'm so happy right now. he died of suicide in 2002. he had become addicted to opioids after a work related accident that required 2 surgeries. during the last one, the surgeon accidentally severed an area near his spine which resulted in a near fatal infection. he was left with the grim prognosis that he'd never work again and he'd probably always have pain. he was prescribed pain killers and began abusing them when he had to double up to get relief. he doctor shopped and had 2 doctors prescribing him meds. after 5 years, they decided to wean him, but the damage was done. he started buying them off the street, stealing money from our bank account, stealing from the kids, pawning our things, nearly bankrupting us. he killed himself after i kicked him out of our home, telling him he couldn't come back unless he went to rehab. but this dream!! he was young and energetic. he was happy. he was laughing. he had no physical limitations. he was smiling and joyful. he was absolutely gorgeous. he was the man i had fallen in love with. i was young too, and we were back in our courtship days. he kept smiling at me and holding my hand. he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me. he bent his head and kissed the side of my neck, the way he used to. in the dream, i was elated. in the dream, i kept thinking to myself, ""look at him! he's gorgeous!"" his face was right up next to mine and he was staring at me, and in the blink of an eye, he was gone. i jolted awake saying his name out loud. i looked around to make sure my present husband hadn't heard me, but luckily he was still at the gym. i spent the next 30 minutes sitting on the side of the couch hugging myself, rocking back and forth, with an idiotic grin on my face. i'm agnostic - i don't believe our souls go someplace (heaven) when we die. i believe we just end. but i have to admit, i kept thinking, ""i hope i'm wrong. i hope we do go someplace, and i hope he's in the place where i just saw him.""

if you've gotten this far, thank you for reading and letting me get this out. i rarely remember a dream for very long and i wanted to always remember this one, so i decided to write it down. i just can't get over the happiness it left in me - it felt like i actually saw him again after all these years - the way he was in the beginning, not in the end.

update: it's been a little over 12 hours since i posted this, and i want to say that i am absolutely blown away and overwhelmed by the response from you incredible people of reddit. all these comments and private messages and not a single negative one. think about that. this entire thread is a veritable lovefest! i wanted to respond to each of you individually, because i felt it was the least i could do after you took the time to write such nice things, and i especially wanted to respond to the comments that crushed my heart, but there were so many. let me just say that i thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your sincere well-wishes and your heartfelt outpouring of love! you guys rock and are the reason i love reddit! thank you to those who shared similar stories of visitation dreams. after reading them, i'm more inclined to believe that maybe there is a place we go to when we die, and maybe our loved ones can visit to let us know they're doing ok and are watching over us. what a feeling! what a comfort! so, to all of you - thank you so very much, i love you all, and keep dreaming!

i'm sorry that the picture is so shitty, but for now it was the best that i could manage. this is a veeeery sleepy bonnie!(https://preview.redd.it/g5c8lrrjd8s21.jpg?width=2592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b40ebe492efc1f42c118df382b49bc28b6c8221)",12
"i am dying, and am unsure how to tell my wife and family. i dont want to leave my children.. throwaway.

i started losing weight in december. this nicely coincided with me quitting any form of alcohol, and starting a diet. i was amazed by the results! i am 6'4 and in january i weighed in at 268lbs, and dropped down to 185lbs by july. 

i truly assumed that intermittent fasting was a miracle weight loss technique. 

during this time, i began developing new back pain. as the pain worsened, i made contact with my neurologist who assumed with was a bulging disc. he previously performed a laminectomy and discectomy on a herniated disc of mine. 

ct showed nothing, and i was sent for an mri. doc didnt like something he saw on the mri, so i was bounced over to another doctor. long story short - i was diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer. 

i have kept my wife in the dark about this. she assumes that it's just a bulging disc, and i've kept it on the down low. she definitely noticed the weight loss, but like me, attributed it to dieting. 

i need to tell her, and dont know how the fuck to start. i'm scared, and dont know how to do this. 

we have two boys. our oldest just started kindergarten, and his brother is a year younger and enjoying pre-k. i am the primary breadwinner, and my wife does not work. 

if you know anything about pancreatic cancer (i didnt, i do now)...the survival rates fucking suck. i'm an optimist, but also a realist. 

it is crushing me inside thinking of her and my boys alone. them growing up without me there. fuck. fuck. fuck. i'm sorry. its terrifying. it's horrible. i don't like it.

and the thing that really sucks? is that besides back pain and a lack of appetite, i feel absolutely fine. constipation is annoying, but doable. i dont feel like i'm sick. but the doctor assures me that i am, and that itll worsen in the coming weeks. 

i dont know why i'm posting here. i just wanted to tell someone. i know, i know...i should've told her before internet strangers. but fuck it. i need to practice. 

i love my wife and kids. i've been with her for 8 years, and she is the sunshine in my life. shes my best friend, and the person i most connect to in this world. shes my person. 

my sons are sweet, loving, kind, and my pride. i love those two tiny men more than they will ever know. i love seeing them grow. i love spending time with them, and being with them everyday. helping my youngest build lego's, and my oldest figure out a recipe on minecraft. theyee everything to me. 

i don't want to leave her. i dont want to leave my boys. 

i dont want to.

edit: good morning...thank you for all for the responses and advice! you've given me so much to think on. i promise i am reading every response, and i'll respond in kind when able. i have to go to work now, but i will be talking with her after work and will lay it all out on the table. i'll update as soon as possible.

edit #2: i told her and she took it as well as one can. being my wildflower, she told me ""if you fucking die, i'll kill you."" lol this is why i married her, and why i love her with my every being. were going to keep fighting this, and shes coming with me to appointment tomorrow to see options that doc can lay out. if interested, i'll provide updates on this thread or profile. for the sake of privacy, i will not use my main account. i showed my wife this post, and she told me in stupid for telling strangers before her, but she understands the misplaced logic behind it. if anything does happen, she has access to this account now and can update as needed. you all have given me so much support that its bringing tears to my eyes. i appreciate each and everyone of you. please know that i mean this from the bottom of my heart. the outpouring of love is amazing. were discussing how to explain this to our sons, but are still unsure how to approach it. my father passed from terminal colon cancer when i was 7, and it took me a long time to understand why it happened. this will be a challenge, but i'm doing everything i can to prepare life for those i love. i dont want to die, and i dont want to leave my family, so i will fight. i know several of you mentioned life insurance...dont worry there. i'm a young male and was perceived as healthy when i initially received life insurance through my employer. i have not told my employer, but they've been supportive of me since i was hired. i work as a therapist in the community, and will continue doing so until i am unable. again, thank you all for your support. 

and...

*please stop sending me these fucking holistic cures. its horseshit, and will not cure anything. me eating daffodils five times daily isn't solving anything.  if you choose to continue sending them, please know i will continue ignoring them. these ""cures"" are dangerous and delay treatment. think before sending this to people who are ill. for every person that ignores treatment to go the holistic route, please understand you are culpable. it is dangerous and stupid to send this shit to people.*",12
"""the worst part about a breakup is their pets don't know what happened to you."". i have never liked cats. i was very hesitant to move in with my boyfriend because he had a cat, charlie. i hated that asshole cat. he was a good boy with a good personality, but god he drove me crazy. he shed everywhere and all of my work clothes were covered in hair. he would dig around in my purse and pull everything out, or even open my dresser drawers and steal hair ties. a few times, he escaped and fell in the river and we had to rescue him. whatever you did, he was right in the way. he needed attention constantly. i hated him rubbing all over me and jumping in my lap at every second. at some point he decided i was his mommy and started sleeping with me. one night he had a seizure while sleeping and peed all over me. i was his favorite person even though i hated him. 

a few weeks ago i had to break up with my boyfriend after a year and a half. he's a great guy, but not the guy for me. he was understandably upset and yelled at me to pack up my shit and get out immediately. i threw everything into a suitcase and walked out the door. as i was leaving, charlie the asshole cat looked at me with the saddest, most confused eyes. i wanted to stop and hold him one last time, but my ex was yelling and i was doing all i could to keep from crying. i just looked at him and walked out. it's been 3 weeks and i'm not over it. 

my ex says he looks for me and sleeps where i used to sleep. i never got to say goodbye and my ex won't let me. i worry about him. i don't want him to be sad and i wish i could tell him why i left. they say that cats don't miss people, but i know by the way he looked at me that that isn't true. i feel incredibly sad over the stupid asshole cat i never liked, more sad than i am over losing his owner. i was right to leave that relationship, but i wish i could have said goodbye.",12
"i tipped a waiter. throwaway 

i just need to tell someone about this. i don't want to tell anyone in my personal life. 

back story 

i am a surgeon. i make one million dollars annually pre tax, after tax i make around 550k ( almost 46k a month ). i grew up poor, i'm a daughter of refugee/immigrant parents who came to canada for a better life for me. all my life i was taught that education was the number one thing. i love my job and i am living the most comfortable life. i am debt free, my parents were able to retire when i paid all their debt and now they are living comfortably just outside the city. 

now the story:

i always come to this family owned restaurant and over the years i have gotten to know the family very well. they are a family that escaped from north korea and came to canada for better life for their son. they have one son named jin. i've known jin since he was 15 years old because he worked at the restaurant to help out his family. jin is a very outgoing boy, when i come to the restaurant and no one was there we would talk about anything, he loved physics. i'd eat at that restaurant around 5 times a week and every time jin was there working. most times he would have his textbook and notebook there doing his homework when he had the chance. so fast forward 3 years. jin is in university, still at the restaurant working after his classes. we were talking one day and he said that he might drop out of university because he needs work full time and help out his parents, money was tight for them. this was very troubling for me because jin loved the stuff he was studying. 

then i decided that i needed to help jin out. 

i went to the restaurant a few days later when they were closing. his parents and him were cleaning up. i offered to pay his tuition for all 4 years of university. jin and his family at first didn't accept out of respect, i'm assuming. after a couple minutes of them refusing and me begging them to take it, the father started to cry, then the mother, then jin. i told them that the only contingency is that jin had to keep an average of 80% on his classes. 



fast forward to 3 months ago

jin graduated from university with honours. 4.0 gpa. i was there at his graduation and i couldn't have been prouder 


fast forward to last week

jin called me and said that he got accepted into university of toronto's medical school. 


edit: thank you all for the kind words. to answer some of your questions. i am in ontario. i don't make all of my 1 million/y salary from my job, i have investments too. i make about 700k from my job (i do a lot of overtime) and 300k from investments (pre tax). also to clear up the medical school acceptance, jin is going into ms1 this month. jin didn't tell me when he got accepted into medical school (december 2016), he told me now (september 2017) that he is going to medical school this month.

"im getting fucking married. yesterday was a normal tuesday. i got back from traveling. he was already home. we had sex since we haven't seen each other in a few days. it was so passionate and amazing. we got into pjs and made dinner together. steak, asparagus and salt potatoes. we played mario kart wii and he was kicking my ass as usual. he got up to get a drink but came back with a blue velvet box. i stared at it like it was something from another planet. he went down on one knee and i immediately started bawling my freaking eyes out. he asked me to marry him and i was somehow able to somehow say yes cry at the same tome. i held him so tight i didn't want to let go. he had no idea which finger to put it on he was shaking so much. 


i'm marrying the man of my dreams. ",12
"employee requested a payroll advance. i could not bring myself to do it.. his family is behind on rent. for the first time ever, they're looking at no christmas as well. he wanted to borrow half of his next paycheck to pay rent, late, this month.

this is a classic snowball. there's no way out. he'd be late in january, setting up the same situation moving forward, lather/rinse/repeat. his family shouldn't sign up for that. i'm not signing up for that.

i told him no. i told him why. i told him that i valued him as a person and an employee. then i paid his outstanding december rent, with a little left over for holiday gifts. i called it a christmas bonus.

i'm taking a chance on this guy. i'm investing in his well-being. i want him here for a few years at least. it was a risky, but pragmatic decision - and it also happened to feel like the right thing to do. i hope it's the right thing to do.

i don't know his family. he's a bright guy, six kids, a wife he's been with for 20 years. i have a good feeling about this.

let's be brave this year. let's choose risk, strength and investment. let's be kind to one another where we can and how it matters. maybe we can build a better reality.

edit: thanks y'all. this turned out to be really uplifting. i don't feel right talking about this kind of thing irl, so i came here to get it omc.

keep the love alive, folks. ",12
"parents should not act like providing necessities is doing the kids a favor.. my mom constantly shares posts about how kids are ungrateful, and how they need to be thankful that their parents pays the water/electric/mortgage etc. i no longer live at home but i have a young sister who does, and i feel so sad for her. providing necessities for your children is not doing them a favor, it is fulfilling a parental obligation to care for your child. i'm so tired of toxic parents who make their kids feel like a burden because ""i don't have to pay these bills. you can move out if you don't like it here."" using necessities to guilt trip your child who is too young to care for themselves is fucked up.",12

"they named their kid after me, and i feel different..  i just had a video call from one of my best friends showing off his two beautiful twins, one of which is named after...me!

soooo after spending at least the last two/three years suffering from horrendous depression, struggling with anxiety and doubting my self worth or point of existence, i managed to start crawling out of my hole this past year.
and i can not begin to describe how much this gesture was the cherry on top of the cake.

i feel like i've had an adrenaline shot of self worth!
knowing my friends thought highly enough of me means the world.

trust me, i know they might have just liked my name... aaaaand i know it might not be that big a deal but for me i'm taking it as a win and am gonna do my best to be the perfect role model for future mini me!

p.s. thank you for the gold! very kind 😁 i've been reading everyone's comments, sorry i can't reply to all but know they all mean a lot to me xx",12
"my husband passed away and i've never felt so relieved..  

six months ago, my husband passed away in a car accident. i remember his father calling me and telling me that i needed to get to the hospital as soon as possible; initially thinking it was regarding my grandmother, i got there asap. i was told when i arrived that he had been in a nasty accident and it was touch and go; many hours later i was told the 'bad' news, that he hadn't made it. i don't remember ever feeling more relieved in my entire life.

i do remember collapsing in floods of tears, but they weren't tears for losing him - they were tears for me realising that my demon had finally gone. tears for the fact that i would no longer have to go through the hell anymore. tears for the fact that there would be no more bruises. tears for the fact that there would be no more excuses. i finally felt free in that moment, that i wouldn't have to endure the physical, emotional and mental abuse anymore. i remember my own father trying to comfort me, just thinking this was a natural response to the circumstances, not realising that it wasn't. no one knew what i went through with him, no one knew that the 'holiday' we took just weeks before, was just me sat at home covered in bruises, with a broken arm, because of him. they didn't know that the substance abuse i was so deep in, was because i was trying to block it all out. they thought he was trying to help me. they thought he was trying to convince me there was more to life. in short, they thought he was a hero. in reality, he was anything but.

i remember sitting at his funeral and i couldn't cry, my face was just like stone. i couldn't conjure up any emotions about him being gone. as his family and friends spoke about how much of a good person he was and how much he loved me, i was just emotionless.

i feel heartless. i know that in a way, i'm in the right to have these feelings, but once upon a time, i loved this person and i married this person and we had good times, before the darkness settled over him. i sit at his families house for dinner many times a month and they talk about him, yet i can't get emotional or even sentimental over any memories, because they're overshadowed by the bad. i haven't told anyone. they think i'm getting 'better', because him dying has shook me up enough to stop me using. in reality, i reached out for help for my addiction, because i didn't need to block anything out anymore.

i don't miss him. i'm happy that he's gone. and that makes me, heartless.",12
"my wife is asexual and i want to debunk a few myths that annoy the crap out of me.. my (29m) wife (27f) is asexual, meaning that she has no interest in sex and does not experience sexual attraction. sometimes we get told things on the internet or irl that annoy the crap out of me. 

my wife and i have been together for seven years and married for four. we are extremely happy together and she is legit one of the most attractive women (especially after we both started working out... i mean she always was hot, but now.... dayum) that i have ever laid eyes on. she 'came out' a few months after we started having sex (i was her first), when over time, she realised she wasnt enjoying it as much as i was. 

the first myth i want to get off my chest is, she does not hate sex! that does not mean she desires sex, she doesnt, like at all. however she is not repulsed or hates it. what was different initially was that sex was awkward for a while. she would get very distracted, bored and felt uncomfortable (while consenting) throughout the entire thing. she has gotten better, and more used to it over time and to be honest (having had alloromantic (non-asexual) partners in the past) the best sex that i have ever experienced has been with her. she understands as a raging heterosexual male, i have desires and she willingly let's me have sex with her to meet those desires. that will be something i will always be thankful for.

asexuality isnt caused by '""not having good sex"" she just doesnt want it. she doesnt masturbate, watch porn or anything like that. she never had any interest in sex before she met me and she wouldn't care if she never thought about sex again.

finally asexuality doesnt mean she doesnt want kids. having kids is something that we both want and she always talks about wanting to be a mum. a few weeks ago we found out we are expecting our first. this has made us both really happy and she cannot wait to start a family with me.

i love my wife to death, and do not want anyone else. she everything to me, and i could not imagine being with someone else.",12
"i f***in did it!!!. for the first time in my miserable life i just said fuck my social anxiety and outright asked a girl out! and she said yes!!! i'm so goddamn proud of myself right now!!!! i'm done now lmao just needed to let this out somewhere

i will definitely update y'all after the date. 

also i seen at least one comment asking how exactly it happened so i figured i'd tell y'all it was on a dating app. this girl and i have been talking for the past couple days but the conversation was dying out and i didn't want yet another ghosting situation, so somehow i got over the idea that her saying no was the worst thing in the world and i just took the plunge.

"my wife's grandma finally called me ""mijo"". alright so first of all i'm white as hell. like total cracker. 195% saltine american. my wife is so mexican that she can lob her chancla from the kitchen and hit me upside the head no matter where i am in the house. because of this, my wife's family has always been very suspicious of me and concerned for my wife for marrying a white boy. fair enough, i understand mexican culture pretty well enough to know how important family is to them and for a while i thought i was contaminating their family because of all the dirty looks they would give me for being so white. well, a few weeks ago my wife's grandma drove up from san antonio to dallas where we live and we spent the whole day together. it was a lot of fun besides the fact that they spoke spanish to each other most of the time and i couldn't understand any of it. when the day was over and it was time to go home, we were saying goodbyes when my grandma maria hugs me, kisses my cheek and says, ""thank you for taking care of my grand daughter. i love you mijo."" for those who don't know what mijo is in spanish, it technically means ""son"" but it's so much more than that. it's a term of pure endearment. to her, to my wife, and to me it was accepting me into the family with open arms. needless to say i cried that whole day. it was one of the greatest days of my life and i have never felt so accepted and loved than in that moment. 

edit: the support i'm receiving from this post has been overwhelming. i never would have expected to see so many people in the same position as my wife and me. thank you so much to all who support us!",12
"i had an abortion & i'm not ashamed.. this may offend people. i don't care.

planned parenthood has been there for me since i was 16 years old. ever since i decided to go on birth control for the first time and didn't feel confident in telling my parents. i was in love with my boyfriend and we were becoming sexually active. i also went on birth control because i had irregular periods and cramps that were beyond painful. i went to them for affordable contraceptive and a safe space to talk to other women about the changes my body was facing. especially since my dad was the one raising me and my mother was never around.

in 2007, i got pregnant. i was a freshman in college, on birth control and it happened. i was at the beginning of my adult life and i wasn't about to put my life on hold because of an accident. my boyfriend and i agreed it would be what was best for both of us. i had an abortion and i am not afraid to admit it. if you have a problem with that, then you are the problem. i did not murder anyone, i discarded a blob from my uterus before it had a heartbeat. i prevented an unwanted baby and for that, i am not sorry.

in 2018, i donated 36 of my eggs to a couple i don't know so they can try to have babies of their own.

i don't want children. i am not selfish. i am not a murder. i am 1 in 4 women who have had an abortion and i am not ashamed.



edit: thank you all for you're kind words &amp; support about this. some have not been super nice but that's ok. i have responded to you accordingly.

edit #2: thanks for the platinum kind stranger!!

edit 3: wow. i am beyond grateful to everyone who has responded to this! i can't believe how relieved i am that so many other women and men have shown their support to me and everyone one else who makes this decision. it's not an easy thing to admit considering so many different reactions to the abortion issue. there are so many responses i can't get to everyone but i appreciate the love. if you're have a difficult time or need to talk please pm me. love this community!

final edit: 
the bills being passed into law in some states have had me and so many others in a tailspin. access to safe abortions and the right to choose what is best for our bodies is vital, not just for women but for men as well. women will continue getting abortions whether it's legal or not, and whether you like it or not. luckily i live in a state that has protected these rights, but if i didn't, i would be doing whatever it took not to have my rights taken away from me. i hope women ( and men) will stand up and fight for the right to choose.",12
"i didn't kill myself today. i just wanted to let someone know without alarming people close to me. i prepared, even tested the branch of my favorite tree in my back yard to see if it would hold my weight. i had spent the morning crying and begging ""god"" the universe, anyone, to send me some sort of sign that i am seen and am an important part of this world. i got nothing. but then as i was standing on my deck looking at my tree, making myself comfortable with the idea of death, i realized i do not want to die i just want to live differently.  i'm ok, i will get some help today. just needed to put it out there that today .......i chose to live.

update!
i am still here! having no medical coverage has made getting the medications i know i need a bit difficult but i have found someone to talk to and that feels like a step in the right direction.  y'all touched my heart with your encouragement and excitement for me and my choice to live.  i will always remember the day i saved my own life and a multitude of strangers cheered me on.  much love to you all.",12
"dear professor, i see you.. last class, you let the students decide whether class would be held in person next session or not. i could see the hurt in your eyes when cheers erupted in the classroom and students started shouting ""no class!"" it's a university setting, and maybe you were hoping for a more mature response. you deflected the situation with sarcasm and awkwardly waited for the excited yelling to stop.

&#x200b;

you are a caring, kind, and passionate teacher. you give minimal homework because you understand there's more to life than busywork. we have to live to truly understand ourselves and our environment. the subject matter is fascinating and you're excellent at making complex topics palatable to all audiences. the lack of compassion and consideration in class that day wasn't a reflection on you, but the state of students now. those students were probably thinking about the lack of sleep they've had, the upcoming midterms, that overdue assignment they couldn't complete because they work evenings and weekends, and generally how much could be accomplished in the extra time they now had. they weren't thinking about your feelings, and how rude and hurtful it would feel to a teacher to have students cheering about class being essentially canceled (other than watching a video online).

&#x200b;

you've mentioned overhearing students discuss how boring the class is. you've brought it up in examples multiple times. i can tell it bothers you. dear professor, i see you. i appreciate you. every day you get up in front of the class and present to hundreds of students. you put in so much work for so little reward, banking on the legacy that you'll create in your students. you take the responsibility of opening minds and exposing them to a wider world of hardship, joy, differences, and similarities seriously, while approaching topics with empathy and sensitivity.

&#x200b;

dear professor... thank you. you are important. even if it's not the same circumstances, i know how you feel. it hurts when others are dismissive of your passion. it feels like a personal attack when you're vulnerable and share this fundamental part of who you are, only to be met with disinterest, boredom, and complaints. the effort you put in feels misplaced, maybe even wasted. doubts creep in about yourself, your passion, your career, your decisions, and more. please rest assured that someone is listening with eager ears and watching with understanding eyes. i see you.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you to everyone who has given input. i will definitely be sending these sentiments to my professor, probably through an anonymous letter (though i'm still deciding whether to include my name or not). i think a letter would be a good format for this rather than face to face, because a letter can be read and re-read over and over if desired, where as a conversation might fade over time. i also like the idea of giving feedback to the dean and department chair, too. special thanks to all the teachers who read this and/or comment. :)  


edit 2: i sent the letter through an anonymous email, that way it's in writing and the professor can print it off if they want. also, this allows the professor to reply if desired, and i can follow up at the end of the term with another email or by speaking to him in person. i'm going to send an email to the department chair too once i have some free time.",12
"i'm giving my son the best graduation present.. so some back story. i was in a rock band back in the early 2000's and we had some success. we toured with breaking benjamin, seether, three days grace and did a bunch of festivals. about 10 years ago my son found one of the bands old cd's and he loved it. he would always beg me to ""get the band back together"" but i would tell him it just could not happen. people moved on. then about 2 months ago we all met up one night just to visit. it was amazing everybody fell back into the way we used to be. so i decided to ask them if they were up for a reunion show and they are. so we are going to play a private show for my son. he has only seen old videos of me playing. he is going to love this. and he doesn't know about it. and i am going to bring him up and we are going to play a song together.",12
"my girlfriend's kids woke me up and surprised me today.. my girlfriend has two kids and i love them so much. they have so many issues with their biological dad because they are starting to realize how narcissistic, controlling and manipulative he is. so i try my hardest to be someone there for them because he won't. they tell me often how they love me and they even call me dad. 

tomorrow is father's day and in the custody agreement, they have to go back to their dads tomorrow. usually they'd go back on monday after school but since it's father's day, it changes. i'm sad that me and my girlfriend lose a day with them and they're sad they can't spend father's day with me like they wanted to. 

but today, as i was sleeping in, i was awakened by feet jumping on me and my girlfriend's bed. both kids were jumping on our bed like a trampoline trying to wake me up. i could see my girlfriend leaning on the door frame, watching with a smile on her face. both kids then started saying, ""wake up dad!"" a bunch of times. i grabbed both of them and we play wrestled. i was half asleep still so they got a major advantage on me but i didn't care. i love them. 

after our mini match, they both grabbed my hands and lead me to the living room. they had a table set up with breakfast that they made (my girlfriend helped them) for me and a cupcake that the youngest made at their dads house for me. there was also a piece of paper that read, ""happy father's day dad. we both love you very much. thank you for spending time with us, listening to us and showing us love from a dad."" 

i legit had to hold back tears from pouring out of my eyes. i rarely ever cry. my girlfriend and her kids mean the world to me and i'm extremely grateful they let me into their lives. 

my girlfriend then came and kissed my cheek and hugged me and said, ""i told you from the beginning that they'd love you because you're everything their real dad wasn't and never will be."" 

i'm in a state of aw and i'm really happy. i love her and those beautiful kids.",12
"the first in my family and i fucking did it. i fucking graduated!. molested when i was 10. dad died when i was 13. raped at 14. started drinking and doing drugs at 15. first in my family to graduate from high school at 17. dropped out of college at 19. got sober at 22. escaped and survived an emotionally abusive relationship at 25. graduating just 3 days before my 26th birthday.


i hope my list of heartbreaking hiccups helps at least one person believe in themselves because you can be the best version of yourself if you want to be. i'm trying hard not to cry, but this feels so good!

**edit: holy shucks! i know everyone says this, but i did not expect this to get remotely noticed. i will try my best to respond to all of you once my family goes home. thank you, thank you, thank you!**

**second edit: wowza! this exploded and i haven't had the chance to respond to everyone. thank you all so, so much for your kindness. it fills me with so much joy to know that this post actually made some of y'all smile. how nice is that? please take care and love yourselves and others.**",12
"first day in 5 years without a cigarette. i'm quitting smoking and yesterday was the first full day in 5 years i haven't had a cigarette! i can do this! 

update: 3 days down - still doing this! currently trying to decide how to treat myself for this little victory! 
update: incase anyone is still interested, 2 weeks!!! ive developed a shitty cough which i believe is my lungs recovery and expelling all the crap they've collected over the years. fun times!",12
"in two days i will start a job making $80k. growing up was not fun.  i didn't know what being a kid meant.  i did know how to differentiate between the different screams my mother would make as to whether or not it was a typical beating or her life was actually endanger.  

my parents were not well off, at 16 i witnessed my first eviction.  twelve police cars were parked outside and men came in with shotguns and side arms drawn.  i saw all of my favorite belongings get placed into a large rental truck and told that i'd be able to get them back, not to worry.  

from 16-18 i lived with my two parents in a single hotel room out of a suitcase.  dishes were done in the bathtub and there was no stove.  

from 18-19 i go to community college in the morning and work graveyard shift at mcdonald's.  i save enough money to buy my first car.  i painstakingly learn how to drive manual and scream when i can't understand it.  eventually i learn.  

after my first year of community college i transfer to a private university.  judging by the title you think you know how this is going to go but you'd be wrong.  

at 21 i am expelled from the private university for having too low of a gpa.  i am accepted back into the program, and have about $40k in debt racked up.   i have one chance to get it right.  

at 22 my father strangles me on christmas eve, places bruises upon my neck for weeks, then kicks me out of the house.  

at 23 my gf of six years kills herself.  the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that my co-signer will inherit all of my debt.  

at 24 i am one semester from graduating with no job in sight.  10 weeks before graduating i am seriously considering suicide as an option if i can't find a job after i graduate.  

at 25 i have graduated college with a bs in the most sought after field today and landed a job making $80k starting with plenty of room to grow.  it allows me to live anywhere.  

in two days i will start that job.  in two days my life begins.  

i fucking survived.  

edit 1: holy shit, this blew up.  thank you for the silver, and gold, and platinum.  they are my first.  thank you for all of the wonderful posts, thoughts and wishes!  i am trying to get to all or most of them.  

edit 2:  i knew there would be a second one.  thank you again for the currencies.  it's also really cool hearing how my story is encouraging all of you.  it's also neat to have this experience and feel a bit special.  when i woke up this morning i had over 150 notifications.  i may have even walked by you today, which is neat to think that someone browsing reddit might be reading my post, nudging their friend and telling them to read it, something i wrote.  that's just so cool.  

edit 3: the field...  i haven't seen anyone get it right but it's definitely grouped into some of the guesses i've seen in some programs.  remember degree seekers, school is an investment.  ",12
"i knew a kid in highschool that never spoke.. i knew a kid in highschool that never spoke. i was kinda a loner myself but it easy necessarily by choice. 
he sat alone at lunch , and i didn't have anyone to sit with so i just quietly ate with him every day. 

i soon noticed he was in a lot of my classes and i started just sitting with him. 
when he thought no one was looking he would smile at jokes or start to doodle , but as soon as he knew someone was watching he would go blank. 

naturally kids started picking on him a little, trying to get him to talk or asking him why he never spoke. none of it seemed to phase him and he would just shrug or smile. 

but what really got me mad was when the teachers would draw attention to him . when they would call roll they would pause at him sometimes and poke fun at how he wasn't going to answer. he would go really numb and still when this happened. 

one day i snapped at a teacher to ""leave him the fuck alone"" and ""if you feel the need to look cool in front of a bunch of high schoolers by making fun of a child than your a pathetic person""

i'll never forget the way he looked at me when i was sent to the office. he had his mouth open like he *wanted* to say something. 

at the office a councilor sat with me and explained that his father died in afghanistan and he hasn't spoken to anyone but his mom since. 

i learned a lot about people from him. i leaned how cruel they can be , i leaned how kind and compassionate they can be. but then thing i learned from him that was most valuable was the power of listening. 

i tried to take my life in november of that year, and i was gone for a few weeks. the entire school totally new because of my brother .  i was a stupid teenager who didn't realize the value of her own life.

when i got back he was waiting by my locker. 

he said hi. 

i thought it was someone else but he gave me a hug and said hi again. 

it was the most meaningful thing anyone had said to me during that time. 

i cried a little and after that he began to speak to me really quietly . it was little things at first like hello and good bye but soon he was asking how my day was and before i knew it he was rolling in laughter at my dumb jokes. 

he knew more about me than anyone because he listened.

after i graduated i moved , i still wonder about him almost every day. 

just wanted to share this with someone.

edit: a lot of people are saying i should find him on facebook and such. i have tried recently but he still doesn't have one, and he's not one for phone calls due to him not speaking much. its hard for him , and i didn't want to push contact like others did.
i get updates from friends in my hometown and they show him picture of me and tell him how i'm doing. 

he's currently living with his boyfriend who is a psychology major , i plan to try to reach out more and may be back in town for a visit. 

thanks for the kind words and encouragement :) 

edit 2: this has blown up more than i expected, i'll try to reply to all that i can ! thanks to you awesome redditors i am contacting his boyfriend and will hopefully soon write him a letter :) 

update: last night i contacted his boyfriend who was very happy to hear from me. apparently my quite friend had tried to find me in the past but didn't know how to spell my current last name since i got married. i got his address and i'm writing him a letter today :) i'll let you guys know what i put :) 



i also woke up this morning to so many kind words and amazing stories,( and my first gold!!!) i'll be sure to reply to all that i can . thank you so much!!!

"i love you. to whoever is reading this, i love you. you've got no fucking idea how much i love you, even if i don't know you i fucking love you. i'm drunk right now so don't judge but to whoever is reading this i really fucking love you and you really fucking matter.",12
"pedophilia is not a sexuality, it's a fucking crime.. i've personally never had an encounter with pedophilia, but seeing all these pedophiles trying to make another move for their *""sexuality""* to be legalized and hiding behind lgbtq+ as a talking point. pedophilia is **not** a sexuality. age is never just a number.

&#x200b;

~~pedophiles make me sick.~~ you are not, and should never be a part of lgbtq+, as people like you (that cannot control themselves and don't see a therapist about it, so than rape little kids) are **fucking criminals.** 

edit: i honestly didn't know that this would blow up as much as it did. i think that i should clarify and apologize for a few things i said. 

1. i misused the word pedophile. pedophiles aren't inherently bad, but what i was referring to were the kind that don't see help and go out and satisfy their sexual needs ( child molesters.)
i understand that contrast makes a lot of difference and i'm sorry for the mixup.

2.  after hearing out the replies, i now understand how clouded what i said was. i'm sorry to any pedophiles currently trying to get help that i may have offended.",12
"my relationship with my fiance will never be the same after this weekend.. my fiance 28m and i 27f have been dating for about 6 years- and engaged for one. a little over 2 years ago, he came out to me as a cross dresser. it wasn't the easiest thing to find out, but i assured him that i would love him regardless. 

this past weekend we attended a pride event in the city. this was his first opportunity to finally leave our apartment dressed up. he was beyond nervous, and so was i... but i tried my best to not let it show. people can be cruel, and i couldn't bare to see him hurt. 

saturday night finally comes. after 2+ hours getting ready and a few shots of tequila later- we make our way downstairs to the lyft. this was his (rather, her) first time being dressed in public. together, we walk into the party matching with black and gold outfits as our theme. 

we had the most amazing night. people were beyond friendly. he (she) was showered in compliments the entire night.  after the party ended- he (she) wanted to keep partying so we ended up at our local bar that we frequently go to. they were so happy to see him (her) as the true person under his masculine self. 

i wish i could personally thank everyone who made that night incredible. he was a different type of happy.  i'm honored that i was the one he decided to step out the house with and take a risk. cheers to all the lgbtq+ community. you guys rock.

update: thank you for everyone sharing their kind words with me! my fiance is a fellow redditor.. and i'll make sure to spread your love to him too.  

-on a serious note though- if there is anyone out there that is dating a cd, please feel free to reach out to me. it's quite difficult to handle when you have no one else to talk to about it... which is what led me to post this. it's hard not being able to sharing an amazing experience with your family and friends. i'd be more than happy to share some personal experiences and hardships that come along with something like this.",12
"to the family who sat behind us.... thank you. i'm a young, black, gay guy in alabama who walked into a waffle house with a much older white guy. you could tell from how much we were laughing and smiling at each other that we were into each other. so what did you do? you left us a note thanking us for being who we are and paid for our meal. you have no idea how much that small act of kindness meant to me, so much so that i've been crying happy, ugly tears ever since i got home. so from the bottom of my heart, thank you, for making me a little less afraid to be myself in this world.

edit: thank you everyone for continuing to blow up my phone with kindness. all of your words are going straight to my heart ❤️. and thank you strangers for the silvers!

edit 2: thank you for the gold! i'm trying really hard not to cry at work right now but y'all are making it really hard.

"i've finally made the decision to leave my husband who has been grooming me since i was 16. we started dating when i was 16 and he was 24. i put everything i had into our relationship because i felt like it was the only thing that could save me from my abusive household. 
i lost my virginity to him and soon after he would pressure me to have threesomes and foursomes with guys he would find on the internet while he video taped it. he would never say anything positive to me because he said i was young and arrogant. 

well when my religious parents found out about him they forced us to get married because he took my virginity. we got married when i was 21, i'm 26 now. 

i posted about our relationship in a different sub reddit about 2 weeks ago and i didn't realize how fucked up the situation was until then. 

i can't take this anymore. he won't touch me, call me attractive, or show any kind of affection unless i go along with his weird sex things. i'm tired of thinking i'm the fucked up one.


i have a college degree in economics and a subpar resume. im just going to be applying to different places all over the country so i can start over and maybe live a semi normal life. luckily i didn't sign a pre-nup so i won't be homeless after i leave him",12
"holy shit i just ordered food for the first time ever!!!. so, to explain why this is so important to me, you have to know about me. i'm 19 years old and have social anxiety, and i have it pretty bad. i also have autism, so i haven't really got much experience speaking to people and doing things most people would find easily socially🙈. 

however, just literally 15 minutes ago, me and my brother who's 16 were discussing how we're hungry, and considering our parents aren't home for another 2 hours, we wanted to eat something. so, we decided on getting ourselves a little kebab take away, and we decided i'd speak and i was absolutely shaking and everything. but it turned out great and it's literally just arrived i'm so happy!!! i phoned my mum and told her and text my girlfriend about it too, this is honestly massive for me!",12
"my boyfriend (25) thought i was asleep.... the other morning i was really sick. it was my time of the month and (due to pcos) i was in a lot of pain. i stayed home from work and spent the night using my boyfriend as a heating pad. he babied me all night and did whatever he could to take care of me. i ended up falling asleep in his lap. he moved me to my spot in the bed, which woke me up, but i was enjoying him doing this that i shamelessly faked being asleep.  he laid down behind me, wrapped his arm around me, kissed my forehead, and said, ""baby i love you so much. you mean the world to me. thank you for making me so happy. i hope you feel better. i love you."" i had to fight back tears. i didn't mention to him that i heard it because i'm afraid he'll stop doing it. i've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but hearing this made me feel at peace for once.

edit: i know there's some of you that don't want to believe this because the title is ""clickbait"" and ""this has been posted before."" i understand that and i hate that people have become so numb to this stuff that they don't believe it can happen commonly. admittedly, i didn't even look through the sub before posting. i was swooning and caught up in my feels and wanted to share. i figured that with all the negativity going on in the world, along with all the mental health struggles i have endured myself, posting something happy and positive would be a good thing. obviously i can't force anyone to believe me but i wish people would try.

but for those that do, thank you for all the nice comments! i wish i could show him but i'm not ready to scare him away from doing this just yet ;)",12
"to the father who walked into my work with his three kids.. you ordered large fruit punches all around. the kids were so happy. you asked about our adobo pizza, said the kids were interested, i told you you wouldn't regret it. the little one asked for a mini adobo fried rice omelette. you said whatever she wants.

i asked if anyone wanted anything else. the big kid wanted the lechon sisig cheese fries. you said before anything else, what was my total at. i told you you about $34. you politely said no, that would be it. i noticed the two $20s you had crumpled in your hand. 

my father, raised me and my brother pretty much by himself and even though we struggled, he always made sure we ate. i lost him last year. now i don't know if these kids' mother was not in the picture, or just at work or something, but it was just so nice to see a father being good to his kids.

i wish i could have given you those lechon sisig cheese fries. but all i could do was keep those fruit punches coming to your kids, who were chugging them down enthusiastically, but being so polite. i wanted to just take those fruit punches off your tab; i would have paid for them myself (i wouldn't steal from work lol) but the owner was right there. i then wanted to give you big jumbo cups to go so your kids could take home all the fruit punch they wanted (something we offer to those who ask,) but i was rushed to cash you out.

all i could do was give you the best service i could, despite it being busy and other customers being demanding, and say, ""happy early father's day"" when i cashed you out. i hope that was enough to show you how much just you and your three angels' presence made my day. 

but the look in your eye when you said, ""thank you, i really appreciate it,"" told me that you sincerely did.

"i'm suspending my business because of what's happening in china. i design and produce stuff in china, then sell it for profit either locally, or on amazon. 



what's happening in china is disturbing, and it's just not hong kong. ughyr muslims are facing a genocide. i don't know what it is, i don't know why hong kong is getting much more coverage, however their mission is important, ughyrs have no one to call for them. 



so i suspended production, stopped it completely, paid what's due and stopped. 



i hope that the rest of people like me follow through. i understand that this will hurt us, but hong kong and ughyrs depend on us. apple, google, nba, blizzard, and countless other companies have bowed down to their chinese over lord's, it's time we show hong kong and the ughyrs that if these corporations are not with you, we are. we the people.",12
"for the past 5 years i've been living a different life and nobody knows long.  i grew up in nebraska, living with my dad because my mom took off when i was 2 and we never saw her again. my dad was extremely physically abusive and would spend all his money on drugs, which meant unless i could stay with a friend i most likely didn't eat that day. my dad didn't keep tabs on me, so as soon as i was old enough to work i was supplying my own food secretly, because if he knew i had money he'd take it. i bought an old car off a friend, fixed it up, saved up a couple grand and took off when i was 17. i didn't tell anyone. i didn't even really plan it. i just packed up my stuff one night and left. i worked odd jobs over the next few years, working long enough to make a paycheck and taking off again. my goal was california, and by the time i was 19 i had made it there. i changed my name, started going to college and after a few months got a decent job. i have a pretty nice apartment, friends who like me and even a girlfriend i've been seeing for a few months now. none of them know who i used to be. i tell everyone my parents are dead, and answer personal questions about my past and the scars my dad left on my body with vague responses. to my knowledge, nobody suspects a thing. every single thing i am i have made myself, and that's how i want people to know me. the stuff i went through with my father growing up deeply affected me, and still does. but i am done being scared of him and i am done letting him control me. 

edit: wow. just...damn. i'm floored. honestly i didn't post this with the intention of thousands of people reading it; to be honest, this secret has been eating at me lately. i wanted to make this post just to see what it would feel like to have it out there, so that maybe i would be more comfortable telling someone. and...just, holy shit. thank you so much for the kind words. upon reflection i believe that in part, distancing myself so much from my past gives me an excuse not to deal with it. i never had anyone supporting me when i was young, but i do now. i have friends that have done so much for me emotionally, and of course my girlfriend. i don't know if we're going to last but i'm serious about her, and i think everyone was right in saying that she deserves to know. i know everyone in my life will be supportive if i tell them, and i will. i'm not sure if i'm 'ready', but if i keep waiting i never will be. thank you again everyone for the kind words and encouragement. you've all done so much for my self esteem and confidence regarding my situation, and i can't thank you enough. thanks for reading, and sorry for the long edit.

"i met my brother that was ""missing""!. here's an update for you all: 

the day after i made my last post, i woke up and called into work. i told my wife (who is essentially my confidant and i tell her everything) the whole story. she wasn't really surprised; she's not a fan of my parents much. but like many of you, she told me to call the number i was given for my brother immediately. she insisted on it. she took herself and my son out for a day together so i could be alone to talk with him. 

i dialed the number about seven times before i actually pressed the ""call"" button. it started ringing and i hung up. then i got frustrated at myself and called the number back. it rang and rang and i got a voicemail, but it was the automated voice, not anyone else's. i didn't leave a voicemail. i thought the whole thing was ridiculous. i called my wife and told her to come home and she refused until i had talked to *someone* on the other end of the phone. 

about an hour of pacing and drinking two glasses of scotch at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, i called the number again. it rang three times. i panicked. i hung up. but this time, the number was calling me back. i swear to whatever god(s) above, i thought my heart was going to stop. i almost threw up right there. i answered the call. 

the first thing i heard on the other end of the line was a guy laughing in the background. there was wind on the phone. the person on the other end was outside and it was windy. ""who is this?""

it was his voice. i knew that voice. it was my fucking brother. my brother! who had been gone for my entire life! i covered my mouth with my shaking hands and just sat there. he kept asking me who it was. the guy in the background was trying to talk over him. he hung up on me. i called him back right away. he answered again. 

me being a creepy ass, the first thing i said after decades of not seeing him and thinking he was dead, i blurted: ""i got your number."" 

he asked me who i was and what i wanted. i said, ""it's me."" there was a really long pause. i thought the call had dropped. then i heard him tell someone to turn the radio down and roll the window up. the sound of wind stopped… and then he asked me my name. i told him and he said that i was lying. i told him i got his number from the missing children's network and detectives. i heard him gasp. he asked me what color shoelaces he wore to a picnic when we were kids, and i remember my mom getting mad at his orange laces with blue shoes. it was the last time we were together as a family. 

i could tell he was crying. the first thing he asked me was: ""where are you?"" and i told him i lived a few hours away from home. without hesitating, he told me, ""i'm coming."" 

he went straight to the airport without any luggage, bought a plane ticket, and flew straight to me. we stayed on the phone with each other the whole time. when he was walking through the gate, i knew who he was right away. he is middle-aged; salt and pepper hair, muscular. he looks just like our dad, only better. i know if i told him that, that would make him mad. 

i literally pushed an old lady out of the way and i just hugged him. he's about two inches taller than me. he was able to pick me up. he was crying, i was crying. i was having a breakdown. we went to a bar at the airport. he wouldn't let me out of his sight. he kept holding onto my arm. he kept telling me how unreal it all was. he apologized to me. he kept crying, telling me he felt horrible. i told him to forget everything and tell me about his life.

he's married. his husband is a doctor—a pediatric oncologist. they live in the pacific northwest. they have two children—girls, 12 and 8. he works as a legal consultant and has his own firm. he has an amazing life. he told me that he thought i hated him and wanted nothing to do with him. we sat at the bar for hours. literal hours. i think we sat for about six hours before i begged him to come home and meet my wife. 

we got home, and my wife was a mess. she hugged him and insisted he stay with us. at this point, his husband was going insane and kept calling him. he had no idea what was going on. he thought he had eloped or something. it was crazy for a couple of days until everything was explained and out in the open. 

my son and my brother were like two peas in a pod. honestly, i never wanted children. my son was an amazing accident, but i'm not good with kids. i'm always afraid i'm going to break them. but my brother is a pro. kids love him. 

he stayed with us for two weeks. and in two weeks, everything about my life changed. his husband and two daughters flew in to stay with us. my brother-in-law and my two nieces. my family. they were my family. they are my family. 

my brother wants my wife and i to move to be closer to him. my wife is on board. i work as a professor at a university and have already started to send out feelers to see if there are any open positions, and i've found one that is actually tenured and higher pay. 

i do not plan on forgiving my parents, but my brother still loves them. he went by their house and knocked on the door. my father shut the door in his face. my mother gave him a hug and told him to take care of himself. then she shut him out. i can't forgive them for that. i have no reason to stay close to them. i want to be with my family. i want to make up for all the lost time. 

it's 2am right now and i'm drinking a tall glass of scotch and grading papers. my beautiful, wonderful, smart, amazing wife is asleep on the couch. she likes to watch me grade papers. my son is asleep in his room cuddled up with all the stuffed animals his uncle brought him. and i'm here, so happy, so fulfilled knowing that my family has grown and doubled in size so suddenly. my heart is happy. i am so happy right now, reddit. i am so happy.

when i spoke to some friends today about not wanting to go in for my 8 hour shift tomorrow, all i got told was ""it's an 8 hour shift, that's a normal length shift.""

fuck you. i know it is. this will be my 6th day in a row. that's around 35 hours in that amount of time. i have some chronic pain in my shoulder, i don't sleep well at all. i have no life at the moment. all my friends are gone, visiting family for the summer. 

i get it. i'm 20. but i'm allowed to be *fucking tired*. jesus christ get off your fucking high horses you pricks. you're not me. this is why i tell nobody anything, because even at 20, going on 21, having financial struggles, mental health and personal issues, and schooling, i'm not allowed to be fucking tired. 

people spwed this shit during the school year too (it's summer now, back in september). i was working 20 to 22 hours a week. i was going to school for 24. i spend 8 to 12 hours a day at school, including classes, 5 days a week. i've been going at 100% since january. i get it, it doesn't seem like a lot to you, but you don't have to tell me my feelings don't matter. 

jesus. fuck off.

edit 2: thank you for all your kind and supportive comments! i hope you all are doing well, and follow the advice you have given me. i do take time to myself, in fact, i ordered a violin to learn how to play this summer! i'm doing my best, and mentally i'm in the best place i've ever been in. i'm glad i could write something that so many people related to.",12
"a drug dealer saved my life. i know it's a hated area. so many drug dealers are the worst people in the entire world but some of them are just people evolved from their surroundings. my dealer was a 35-40 year old black dude named b. and b sold me things for a long time about 3 years. well one day i call b and ask for stuff and he tells me that he concerned on what's out there right now and his last batch wasn't safe. he told me he's known me too long and as he put it he ain't gonna let his young bull go out like that. 

so i make another call to a friend of his named curtis and met him bc i really wanted shit as i am an addict. well i show up and as i am about to do shit none other then b walks through the door. he slaps the shit outta my hand and scares the shit out of me. not even 3 min later curtis gets a call that someone was found dead and it's probably his shit. this is fetenyl it kills. 

b didn't stop there. he brought me outside and i dunno if it was the day he was having or what but he never looked like this before. he told me that he's done given me shit and that i need to.open my eyes and this isn't a lifestyle. he told me i'm too good for kensington ave and it's deaths and i need to move on. he said he was stuck but not me. and then i left.

b kept his word. no one would answer my calls. the few other guys near his block would tell me keep fuckin walking bc they knew me. this led me to really think and go get help i needed especially from withdrawl

today i am 1 year and 7 months clean. i got a good job and and clear head. so when you hate a drug dealer it's understandable but just know they are human too and some of them wish they weren't trapped by drugs whether they use or not. i can tell you by the look in b's eyes that day, he would do anything to have not made his early mistakes and been in jail and be out of the drug scene.

update: wow is all i can say almost. this is crazy i never thought this would blow up like this. thank you all so much for the support your an amazing group of people. i thought for sure people would hate this because of the topic but i am blown away. obviously maybe i was the closed minded one thinking people wouldn't like it bc 1. it's another drug addict post and 2. that story about b and people tend to hate dealers. 

but really thank you all so much. as for anyone wondering about b from what i have heard is he might be back in jail. he refused my calls so i never got to talk to him again but i am going to try and maybe write him a letter if he is in jail. he really did save me and maybe he's done a million things wrong but he saved me from a sure death. again thank you all and please anyone trying to get clean seek help. also in my own personal philosophy look out for signs. when u buy that bag of dope if there's a rehab billboard in front of you maybe the universe is telling you something? good luck to all of you!",12
"today i faced my rapist and won. today i faced down my rapist in federal court. 

i won. 

it was heart wrenching, terrifying, painful, sickening, uncertain at times and empowering. 

this has been years coming. 

i am both so sad for what i went through then and now- but also so relieved. there is some kind of peace with this validation that my soul has been searching for a long time. 


i am so grateful for my wonderful lawyer and paralegal. i am so grateful for the judge- and the support of my sister who showed up when i was most vulnerable. 

i am so proud of myself for conducting myself in a strong healthy manner. that event entirely changed the course of my life- and today is one of the first steps to closing that chapter and engaging back in live again. i'm so proud of myself. 

due to the fact that it hard to handle how uncomfortable it makes people to raise the issue of rape (ie makes me feel worse than if i hadn't said anything at all- and how it can make me feel treated differently), i haven't really had that many people to celebrate with- and i don't really expect much here. i just wanted to share the letting go of something that had been so close to killing me for such a long time.

update: i want to thank everyone who has shown their love and support. i wrote this last night before going to sleep because i needed to get it off my chest and expected maybe a few comments- then to wake up to this support and outpouring has meant a lot. i haven't taken the time yet to read all the comments because i become emotional - this was all a lot and still raw— but wanted to say from the bottom of my heart: thank you.",12
"(anorexia outpatient recovery) instead of starving myself today, i ordered pizza. i really didn't want to eat anything, been taking a few steps back with recovery lately. but i ordered a pizza today and ate a few slices. and you know what? the pizza tasted glorious. i feel like i won a battle today.

edit: wow, thank you all for the support! thank you for making my day brighter :)",12
"my bf spends 10 minutes on my balcony each day. he just stares at all my plants and says ""you've done a good job"" and proceeds to patiently listen to me explain every single new plant development in great detail.

"i laugh when i think about my best friend's funeral.. my best friend lost her battle with cancer about 15 years ago. she fought strong and hard for most of her life and she was 25 years old when she passed away. 

the service was at a baha'i temple and it was hours long. i remember thinking she would have been so pissed if she had to sit through something like this. but, it was lovely, nonetheless.

at the burial site, a fucking crane, carrying her coffin on a small, loud-ass bulldozer (she was a very big girl) was reversing while its back-up-beeper is just blaring, and echoing throughout this tiny corner in the cemetery. the person speaking was literally yelling over this truck/crane/fucking back-up-beeper.

then... the crane starts swinging and her coffin hits and breaks a nearby headstone. all the cemetery guys have been called over. they're on their walkie-talkies, frolicking through our funeral and shit. meanwhile, the god damned fuckin tractor is still running.

the step-mom, overcome with emotion, faints. upon seeing this, the mom pretends to faint, so the step couldn't one-up her.

now come the fire department and the police, with their sirens blaring.

now, the women refuse to leave the scene until their daughter is buried in the ground, so the emt guys stuck around and kinda awkwardly  joined our funeral.

it was a scene from one of the most amazing movies i had ever witnessed in real life. every time i think about it, i fucking crack up.

i sometimes feel guilty when i am telling other people about it and legit can't breathe because i'm laughing so hard.

my friend was one of the most inappropriately hilarious people i had ever met in my life. i know she's laughing with me.",12
"i can just step over this thing, but my colleague in a wheelchair can't. what is wrong with people?. went to a meeting on the third floor of a building. met a colleague there who gets around in a wheelchair. she's funny, and smart, and competent, and it was my first time sitting in a meeting with her. she made jokes about how she brought her own chair and didn't need one of the provided ones. she was amazing and good at her job. 

she had a hard stop, and we left the meeting together. she had a lunch appointment to make. on the way out, i waited for the elevator with her. it was an eternity. there was a tremendous cacophony of bangs and noise coming from the elevator shaft. when it finally came, it was packed full of beer kegs, a dolly, and a man. he smiled, and apologized, clearly sorry. there was a restaurant on the ground floor, and they have to store their beer somewhere. fair enough. not going to carry it up the stairs. we waited again as he unloaded it. when the elevator finally did get back to us, we were relieved. 

until we got to the ground floor, where there was an electric pallet jack sitting directly in front of the elevator door. with an empty pallet on it. what the fuck would she have done if she was alone? this woman would have been forced to yell for help until someone came to move the jack. i didn't know how to operate it. i had to drag that heavy thing out of the way. 

i had my privilege checked. big time. i wouldn't have given it a second thought if i was alone. hop over it. be on my way. i honestly don't think it would have occurred to me either that leaving something in front of the elevator could have been so damaging to another person's dignity, mobility - their freedom of movement. i should have thought to take pictures. 

i hope after reading this you will think about it now too. i certainly won't forget it. i can't stop thinking about it. i want to reach out to her, tell her how angry i am about it. tell her that i see the world differently. but that would just be for me, it wouldn't do anything for her. she carried on with her head held high. probably not the first time she had to deal with this. and she's not alone out there.",12
"i overheard my boyfriend asking my dad for his blessing.. on christmas! i had gone to bed, and they were chatting by the fire in the room next to mine. unbeknownst to them, i could clearly hear their conversation as my dad gave my partner his enthusiastic permission to marry me. 
a few moments later, my boyfriend came in and i pretended to be asleep. he kissed me sweetly on the forehead and held me for a few minutes as i snuggled up to him. he seemed to be extremely relieved. merry christmas, indeed! :-) 

edit: wow!!!! i went to sleep and woke up to so many sweet messages and comments! thank you all so very much- it's so awesome to be reminded to hold gratitude during this time. 

edit 2: this is coming up in the comments a lot, so i thought i would address it! my father was not at all expecting or requesting to be asked, as we are a pretty liberal and non-traditional california family. asking the father's permission is not common in my boyfriend's culture either. one day i offhandedly mentioned to my so that if we were to get engaged, i thought giving my dad a heads up and asking for his blessing (more like 'hey, are you cool with this?') would be an awesome way for them to connect without me, and would make my dad feel comfortable and respected. it makes me feel so loved that he made that extra effort :-) 

thank you for the gold!!!!!

i may be schizophrenic, but this isn't normal at all for people to do. it's more insane than i am.

today is the catfish festival, and my brothers came by to visit. with a ton of racial slurs. i kicked them out of my apartment. screw that festival, and their freaking confederate flags. i don't want to identify with these people. it's not mentally healthy for me and it's wrong. i've never been so angry in a long time.

edit: thank you all for reaching out. thank you from the bottom of my heart to those of you guys that offered to help cover the tip, that means more then the money itself. seriously life's been hard lately and it feels really good to be on the receiving end of some positivity!! so don't worry you all have done enough.  the guy ended up leaving his real name and number under the reservation... so hopefully something will come of it. your all awesome thanks again. also i feel like i should clarify i'm a dude haha",12
"an ode to my cheating husband, from your wife who can't sleep. you are a compulsive liar

one might say your pants are on fire

you couldn't keep away from tinder

and now our marriage is a cinder

-

you had cyber sex on messenger

i even had to question her

you gaslighted me, got mad, denied

but your mouth twitched every time you lied 

-

this time when you cheated

i finally admitted i was defeated

four years of love, two of marriage

done. finished. a relationship miscarriage.

-

you haven't even moved out yet mate

and i saw you on the street with your tinder date 

what lies have you told her about us?

i guess you're ready to destroy another girl's trust

-

i lie awake at night, i think and cry

i constantly ask you why, why, why

you can only say 'i don't know fam'

'i need space', 'don't tell me what to do, damn'

-

you're mentally ill and i can't fix you

i've tried and tried, it won't do

i understand you're very depressed

that's no excuse to treat me 10th best

-

i helped you grow from a boy to a man

i must've failed somewhere in my plan 

i'm no longer proud of who you are

lying and cheating: a memoir

-

next week you move out, i'm all alone

i'll waste nights lamenting by phone 

about the man who was my best friend

the man who vowed to stay til the end

-

i'm proud to say i'm not a doormat

so now it's just gonna be me and the cat

my heart hurts so much and i love you so

but i know i'll be alright. you have to go.",12
"i got a free chick-fil-a sandwich. i sold back three textbooks to my campus bookstore today, $85 of books for $1.50 cash. feeling depressed and disheartened, i walked up to chick-fil-a and handed over my $1 bill and two quarters and asked if i could use them towards a basic chicken sandwich and put the rest on my debit card. 

the cashier turned around, grabbed a sandwich, and handed it to me. she told me to just take it and have a nice day. if she ever sees this reddit post, thank you for the free lunch, it means more to me than you know.

"my dad would hate me if he knew i did this.. i'm 27 and male. i work at a hotel where most of the rooms are empty and don't get used. i very often find myself with maybe 40 minutes to an hour of free time at work and i use that time by going to one of the empty rooms where all the items are pushed to the sides against the walls and covered in dust sheets. i close the curtains and i put my bag on the bottom of the curtains so no light comes in and then i wait for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. i then proceed to warm up and put my headphones in and i do ballet. i have been doing it for years and i teach myself the techniques and ""moves"". my dad is against anything that shows flamboyance in the slightest and would always refer to me as a sissy if i did something less than manly. 
this confession is mostly embarrassing because of the way i hide it. i often stop myself mid pirouette to put my ear against the door in momentary worry. i must look a fool.

"my loving girlfriend. the other night we were watching a film together, we were cuddling and i was really tired and ended up falling asleep on her. she kept cuddling me for a while then rolled me over onto my side of the bed. i woke up a bit as she did this and as she kissed me on the side of my head and i quickly fell back to sleep. 

when i woke up in the middle of the night i realised she had filled my water bottle up for me in case i needed it in the night (which i almost always do) 

i know this seems small but i just felt so loved and warm inside because of this and wanted to post it here because i don't want to bore my friends by gushing about how great she is.

"today i cried over the lawn. i am a woman who knows no bounds. i used to be married to a man who did all the ""manly"" things and made me feel as if i couldn't do them simply because i didn't know how or i wasn't strong enough.

since he up and left me for a girl he met on tumblr 8 months ago with only himself and his own happiness on his radar, i have changed my flat tire, got my oil changed, changed the filter on my furnace, fixed my garbage disposal, recaulked my tub and a final task that i have been dreading.

i mowed my lawn. that part wasn't the hard part. getting the mower to start was the hard part. i put the gas in, checked the oil, put starter fluid near the carburetor, figured out how to push the little bar down and pull the trigger at the same time, and eventually cleaned the spark plug. it took a good half hour to get it started but i did it. all on my own. 

when i finished mowing the front and backyard i stood looking out over my lawn and i cried.

after all he put me through, moving across the country for him, getting a new job, being promoted in a year and a half, him leaving me in a place where i don't have any blood family, having to adjust to live by myself after 9 years, paying for everything on my own, and mowing the lawn i cried for everything i never thought i could do.

i cried because i claimed my independence and my house today. i can do anything.

"today i properly cleaned my room for the first time since my suicide attempt, and i'm proud.. on the 11th of october i swallowed about 30 pills.

i've been struggling with my mental health for 2 years.  
first came a depression when i was about 13, which slowly turned into mood swings.  
i don't remember not hating myself for longer than a month at a time.  
everything that i didn't do correctly would feel like a character flaw, everything positive was just ""normal and everyone should be able to do that"".  
i am failing school, i've neglected my life.

but today, with the help of medication and my loved ones, i finally cleaned my room.  
it might not seem like a lot, but for me it's the first step in breaking the invisible wall i created for myself.  
i'm going to change my bad habits, i don't want to be a slave to my own mind.

and for once, i think i'm actually proud.  
maybe if i just love myself a bit more, i'll be able to keep this up :)",12

before i left to go to work this morning, just as i'm standing at the door i always say "" love you pickle, have a good day at school"" and today she turned to me and said ""have a good day at work daddy too, love you"".

i almost broke down in tears. i've not cried in years, even when my nan passed last year, i hold everything in. she really made my day saying that. it really is the smallest things in life that get you by and that sentence she said almost broke me. i've been in such a good mood all day so far because of her, even if work is currently stressful, she's getting me by.",12
"next week i will go from making $180 a week to $43,000 a year. secretly, i was/am terrified of success, and so, i only emailed out two resumes in the 2.5 months following graduation (i told everyone else i was applying everywhere).

 turns out one of those places was an excellent company that loves to give unexperienced graduates a chance, while mentoring them into the role. most of their staff end up staying on for 20+ years. 

next week my life changes, 10 years ago i was hopitalized for multiple suicide attempts, and while i never thought this could be possible, i'm not scared for my future. i can't believe that i believe this, but i earned this. i deserve this.

edit: i really appreciate all the response, but i'm not going to giving out the name of the company i work at. i work in law so you need certifications. the best advice i can give to break into the professional (office) world is to take a administrative course and seek a entry level position as an assistant and work your way up 😊",12
"stop sexualising my job.. i work as a nurse. i'm currently seeing a guy who's amazing etc but when i was on dating sites or just irl almost every single guy would make some comment about how sexy a nurse is. ""oooo a sexy nurse"" ""bet you look good in that outfit"" etc. 

i've dedicated my life to saving and improving other people's. doing cpr on a patient for 20 minutes waiting for the ambulance to arrive because i'm on a community posting. working 13 hour shifts spending most of it dehydrated with a full bladder because i'm so overworked. getting covered in blood from a road traffic collision. comforting family members when their loved ones die. constantly monitoring my patients to ensure they recover as best they can. i spend 40 hours a week working in a super stressful environment whilst studying another 40 hours in the same week to make myself a better nurse. seeing more dead people at the age of 23 than most 70 year olds have through their full life. performing cpr on a choking child at a restaurant on my day off and saving the child's life and seeing the pure relief from the parents. 

this is why i'm a nurse, not to fulfil your sexual fantasies. 

my career is saving lives, not giving you a hard on. 

i'm dedicated to saving peoples lives and maybe yours too one day. 

please don't sexualise my career. it diminishes everything i've done and do. i'm not an object for your desire. 


rant over.

edit: thank you guys for all the kind comments. i hope you all have good health and happiness. here's my time to preach, please learn proper cpr technique, you may never use it but if you do you can save a life.

edit 2: some people asked for a reliable source on current best practice for cpr. here's a link from the nhs that gives technique for all age groups, from new born babies to adults source(https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/). if you're in an emergency situation doing cpr you can recruit members of the public to take over as cpr is exhausting.",12

"staying home with my ""daughter"". my girlfriend has two beautiful kids. male and female. 

this week, instead of being in my girlfriend's custody, they are going into camp. it's something they do every summer before school starts again. 

but on monday, the day they usually come back to my girlfriend's, her daughter called us and said she wants to come back home cause she misses us. 

so my girlfriend goes and picks her up and brings her home around 12am, monday night. 

it's been me mostly home alone with her for a few hours in the morning and afternoon due to my girlfriend's mom in the hospital. 

it's only wednesday and i'm already so fucking happy i get to spend time with her. 

we play games, watch movies and tv together, go for breakfast, play outside on the play structure and a bunch of other stuff. 

both kids call me dad and i literally just feel my heart melt every time she calls me dad. 

then when my girlfriend comes home, the fun doesn't just stop there, we all hangout and wrestle with each other. usually it's them against me but oh well! 

i miss her son too but i'll get to see him on friday and spend time with him too. play video games or code some programs or our very own little video games together. 

i love her and ""our"" kiddos. 

they are starting to see how their bio dad is controlling, emotionally abusive and manipulative. there's been many nights of talks i've had with both kids talking about their frustrations with him or crying about shit he's done.

"when did we loose our humanity. okay so yesterday someone reversed into my car while it was parked at daycare where i was dropping my kid off at, i had just gotten out of the car myself with my kid. the person who reversed into my car pulled over to the side. this person was very clearly shaken. they were trying to hold back tears. 

i myself have been in a similar situation where i accidentally caused damage to someone else's car and i remembered the feeling of guilt so well (it's not something that will ever leave me).

so when this person got out of their car and kept apologising i remained calm and asked them where they okay, they said they were. i also asked was the baby in the car okay, and they replied that the baby was fine. the person kept apologising and shaking. they gave me details on how to contact them. so we both went and dropped the kids off to. while walking back out i noticed this person was still shaking and crying. i comforted them and asked them where they okay to get home, they said they were. 

as the day continued and i was at work something clicked with me that i actually knew who this person was and i was friends with their daughter. i decided to contact their daughter to make sure they were okay, because i couldn't get the worry out of my mind (they had mentioned a health condition when i was reassuring them). the daughter got back to me to tell me that they were still in shock and that they were soo sorry. they also asked about the damage to my car. i told them that i would get it assessed when i left work and let them know. i also told them that i really just wanted to make sure that the person was okay. 

after work i got the damage assessed and the person gave me a number of quotes depending on how they fixed my car... i told them i wanted the cheapest option as this person had been through enough and they didn't need extra financial concerns added to their worries. the repair man seemed shocked when i said this and said ""most people go for the most expensive option and get panels replaced"" now why would i do this when the damage could be repaired for a fraction of the cost baffles me. 

later on i was talking with someone else about what happened and they said ""why aren't you claiming for whiplash"" to which i replied ""well i wasn't even in the car and more importantly it's not true""  they were like ""well i would be saying i was in the car and i have whiplash""...

when did we start going down this path where all we do is claim? why would we make life so awkward for another person? 
can't we all have a bit of humanity and realise that we are human... we make mistakes... accidents happen! don't make life harder for others than it already is! 

disclaimer: i know i'm not perfect and sometimes i do make things harder for others even though i do try my best not to.

thank you to anyone who read this... i just needed to get this off my chest!

edit: thank you to everyone who replied to my post. i will do my best to get through all the comments as soon as i can. 
also i would like to thank those who gave me an award. 
i can't believe how much attention this post has received.

also sorry about the spelling mistake in the title i can't change it now 🙈",12
"living in hong kong, reddit is the only place that reminded me what normal is. everyday, there are news of teargas going off somewhere, it's just the matter of which street or which train station. and i've been to all of these places, maybe to visit a friend, or maybe it's where my special pizza place is at, or maybe it's just a 20-minutes walk away from where i live. now it's all so suffocating... and not just because of these damn teargas.

after the teargas, people would be brutally beaten then arrested. those are nasty scenes, and you can see pure hatred in their eyes. some high-ranking officers called us cockroaches. you whip out your pesticide and stomp those creatures to death. and it just so happens that these creatures are us.

the local forum is a mess, seeing so many people trying to navigate this when we're equally clueless, trying to make sense with the broken pieces we could gather. people have gotten ptsd, and for those who haven't... for me, i have trouble sleeping. i'm lucky enough to be able to pay for therapy, at least. but not the others who need it direly.

i don't see a future. i don't even know when i'll die. maybe this sunday, during another upcoming march, shot dead by the incoming chinese army.

browsing reddit today, the normality shocked me. cats, something to do with weddings, entitled shoppers, tea with biscuits, lawns... it is so easy to forget i had a normal life just a few weeks ago, in a modern, commercial, vibrant city.

don't take it for granted.",12
"i'm fucking doing it!!. i've paid off 80% of my debt, i'm busting ass in my amazing job, i finally cut off the abusive asshole i let dictate my life for over a year, and i'm going to be saving to fix my totaled car i worked my ass off to buy brand new two years ago.

the last two years have been filled with drugs, alcohol, arrests, abuse, homelessness, fear, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and being an irresponsible mess of a human. but fuck it you guys i'm finally on the right track again and i've never fucking felt better.

thanks for listening, just needed to let that out!!

"i was raped by my girlfriend. i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.

edit: thanks a lot everyone for the support, i am in therapy, i'm okay. 
for those asking, yes, i did have an erection, and no, i was not enjoying myself.",12
"so now i have a toothbrush at his place. he(30m) asked me(27f) if he could leave a toothbrush for me at his place, and i answered something like ""oh, no need to worry, i always carry one with me"". he looked crestfallen for a second, and then i understood what he meant. quickly, i said ""but it would be really easier to have one here. now i can leave the one i always carry around at work!"".  


his face just lighted up in a way i can't describe. really, he is so very handsome, he is so very sweet.  


in retrospect, i should've get the meaning of his request at the very moment he asked. maybe these last 5 years alone, recovering from the worst relationship you can imagine, that left me a little rusty. but now i'm ready. and i want to do this with him. i have a healed heart, a healed mind, and so much love to give. after so long, i can finally say i love myself and i love someone else. so now i have a purple toothbrush at his place.",12
"my son told me ""good night"" all on his own. my five year old has autism and for the most part is nonverbal. he usually requires prompting to say anything, and doesn't always understand the meaning behind the words he's speaking. 


tonight he came up to me, leaned in for a kiss and very clearly said ""good night"". no one told him to say it. we didn't even tell him it was time for bed. he was simply ready to go on his own and voluntarily told me good night. it caught me so off guard. i'm absolutely over the moon :)",12
"i got my skull caved in and it's simultaneously the worst and maybe also, the best thing that's ever happened to me.. i'll start with the bad stuff first: 

so i'm 3 days into my spring break with 4 friends in colorado. initially, i didn't want to go because i had a bad feeling about it. i actually called my mom a few days prior to leaving, trying to get her to convince me not to go. but she didn't, so i went. me and my friends made it there safe and we went sightseeing everyday, and so i'm actually having fun at this point. night comes and we all smoke some weed that we got at a dispensary earlier that day. some time passes and i don't feel high so i take one on my edible gummies that i bought. one of the friends that's with us is a giant stoner and tells me that there's no way that just taking one will do anything to me. i know that's not true at all but, i listen to her anyway and take 3 like she told me to. within minutes, i go from having a great time to being way too uncomfortably high, and she thinks it's hilarious. and everyone else does too. 
	
so i watch tv and try to stay calm until it wears off. when it finally does, i go to bed. before falling asleep, i lay out everything that i'm going to wear tomorrow when i finally get to ski for the first time in my life. i go to sleep so excited, it's insane and i'm still a little high. 
	
i start dreaming, at first they're regular nonsense dreams, but then i start thinking that i've been asleep for a very long time. it's like that little alarm that goes off when you've overslept for work or something. anyway the dreams start getting really weird, the first one that a remember is being wheeled into a japanese hospital, then blackness for the longest time. after that i would would have little flashes of waking up in a hospital room, with a view of a tokyo skyline out of my window and then i would start to vomit uncontrollably, which is something i'm used to because i have stomach problems due to anxiety. sometimes i would hear my dads or moms voice. but those didn't happen often, it was mostly black. blackness with only thoughts. as time went on, i started to become aware that i couldn't wake up no matter how hard i tried. at this point, i know that something is really really wrong. 
	
all the sudden, i have one of those hospital room dreams, and in walks kurt cobain and he asks if i want to talk, i say yes and then we're on a bench outside. he's asks if i know what's going on and i say no. i don't remember what he says happened to me but i had the understanding that i was in a bad way. then he said that i'm going to be fine and this is all about to end. then blackness again. 
	
then it finally happens, i wake up for real this time. guess what? i'm in a hospital room. my parents are sitting across the room, both on their phones. i can't believe my eyes. i go to run my hand through my hair and there is none. my head is shaved and a line of staples going from the part in my hair to my ear in a huge u shape. my parents see me awake and rush over to me. my mom asks me if i know what's going on and when i go to say no, i realize that i have absolutely no clue how to actually say no, or any other word for that matter. 
	
anyways, this is what actually happened. the night that i fell asleep high wasn't the end of the story. i actually woke up the next morning and drove with my friends to the ski rental place in the snow. on the way there we hit some ice going around a corner and started to spin. we where on a mountain road and ended up in the other lane right in front of a suv going over the speed limit. we were t-boned and so hard that we spun back into our lane and got rear ended by the truck that was behind us. i just don't remember any of that happening at all. 
	
no one in the car knows what i hit my head on, but i was out cold immediately. the stoner chick that i mentioned earlier was sitting next to me and broke a couple of fingers in the impact and demanded to get out. her door was smashed shut and so she decided to crawl over my body, knocking me over in the process, she also wasn't wearing a seatbelt. i started to bleed profusely out of my nose, mouth, and ears. this was because i had sustained a 3 inch depression fracture on my temple in the crash which had shifted my brain the the other side of my skull, as well as two other skull fractures. i also broke my nose, both cheekbones, and my tailbone. i was loaded into a ambulance and taken on a 2 hour ride to level 1 trauma center. i was intubated and sedated. my parents were called and left work the get on a flight from texas to colorado immediately. i got my skull put back together with hardware and i remained in a coma for 4 days until they realized that i had gotten pneumonia, which almost killed me. so 8 days later, i woke up. 
	
the expectation for someone with my injury would be a pretty dramatic change in quality of life, but i woke up and mentally i was pretty normal, it took some work, but i started to walking again. and quickly i basically learned how to talk again, although i talk very slow. every doctor i've talk to since, has said a that i'm beyond lucky. i'm a little slower now and i can't function without stimulants. but everything is different now, i don't even feel like the same person at all sometimes. i think of the person i was before the accident in the way you'd probably remember a friend that had passed away. it's fucking weird. it feels like i had all these memories uploaded into me. the whole thing has been such a colossal mindfuck. 

here's the good part:

	i sat in that hospital bed and thought about my whole life and how since early childhood i've felt this dark cloud over me, and suddenly it was gone. like i had been miserable my whole life. i've thought all of the horrible things about myself my whole life and i realized it's all bullshit. i am attractive, i am worthy of love, i am smart, i have great judgment, and people fucking love me. for so long i was paralyzed by these feelings and after almost losing my life, i realized what i really have. and beyond that, i'm not afraid of anything. what else can life do to me? what's the pain of rejection compared to the pain of that i've already gone through? it's nothing.

it's been just 3.5 months since the accident and i spent a month in the hospital but i'm finally back to life. and i'm determined to live it the best way that i can. i've found the power of positive thinking and i know now that's the only way that i made it through this. i've started to take up for myself and believe in myself. it sounds crazy, but i feel like this experience has taught me so much that i'm actually grateful for it in some ways. life actually looks beautiful to me now. i'm so glad i'm only 24 and there's still time to enjoy it!",12
"i'm going to live rent free as soon as i leave my parents house. i can't tell anyone in real life because i don't want them to look at me differently. when my siblings and i were young, our parents bought a nice flat for each of us in a good neighbourhood for when we want to move out. we didn't know about this until this year. my older sibling is 25 and i'm 23 and we both have plans on moving out soon. we literally don't have to look for somewhere to live neither will we have to worry about paying rent! we both work good jobs and only need to pay a $25 service charge for rubbish collection and security. i feel so so lucky and blessed and thankful to my parents. such a huge burden squashed. a lovely 3 bed flat all to me. the title deeds are going to be changed to our names by the end of this year. i am so excited for this! i feel really so so lucky.


edit: i did not expect this to get this much traction! thank you so much to everyone who's been so kind to me and wished me well! i'm trying to reply to everyone but i'm back at work now so i might be kinda slow. thank you as well to anyone who's been unkind because you've reminded me why it's a bad idea to tell people in real life.

and i've always wanted to say this: thank you kind stranger for my first precious stone!!! 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛",12
"i opened a restaurant this year and not a single family member or friend has been in.. it hurts.

we're busting our butts and doing so good only 6 months in!

my mom will ask questions like ""so these are really people just coming off the street and not people you know?"" kinda stings. we've created a dope space with amazing food, why wouldn't people off the street wander in? guess you'd have to actually come in to understand that...

update: damn, i just needed to get that off my chest real quick! haha. sorry for a later reply. we've been preparing for a little event this evening. i appreciate all the support thoroughly! it means so much to see all of the encouragement. it's been a process. we've definitely made new friends along the way and i'm forever appreciative of that. no need for any fake reviews cause i know we are killing it, i just gotta get over proving that to my mom and friends.",12
"today is the first day in years that i woke up and didn't immediately think about killing myself. i feel great.. i've had severe depression for almost 5 years, and i've been suicidal for about as long. when i woke up this morning, instead of having to fight the urge to kill myself, instead i lay awake and couldn't stop smiling. it felt amazing.

i put on an outfit i haven't worn in years, and i felt so good about myself walking through the city listening to music on my phone. it was like i could all of a sudden see everything i've been missing for the last 5 years. i saw beauty in the trees on the side of the road, seeing kids playing at a park made me genuinely happy, the weather was gorgeous. everything felt wonderful.

i put fresh strings on my guitar and played it for the first time in months. it felt so nice to finally be able to feel joy from something that i used to love.

i just finished watching some favourite movies of mine and i'm sitting here browsing reddit and my guinea pig is eating lettuce next to me.

this might not seem like much to anyone else, and there's a chance that no one will ever see this, or even care, but i just feel like i need to shout it from the roof tops!

the world is a beautiful place and i can't wait to wake up again tomorrow.",12

"i got hired!! it's been a rough jobless year.. only 50$ bucks left in my account. thank god. okay so i still can't believe i got this job! it feels so unreal! 

so i have been job searching since last august, and the last four months of the search i basically lost all motivation and felt like there was no where to go. luckily, i still pushed through it. 

i was actually hired a week prior for min.wage position that offered no benefits and just bad. the day before i started that position i got an email for a phone interview. i squeezed it in before heading to my first day of work. a couple hours later they wanted to set up an interview for the next day. i quickly went to the manager and asked if i could leave early tomorrow since i had a prior appointment ( i felt bad but i figure it was a good excuse because they hired me on the spot with no notice on the start date) but they said no. i went home and realized that i really wanted this job, so i took the risk of resigning after one day of work. the next day i was about to head out for the interview but i got an email saying they needed to reschedule. my heart dropped and the rush of regret of quitting set in. my mind started racing and i started to realize that i probably won't get this job. i quickly rushed back on indeed and starting sending out my resumes yet again. luckily, we ended up rescheduling for the next day. i went and the interview went food, but i knew i messed up a couple times. when i got home my anxiety was to the roof because now i had to play the waiting game. the next day i felt so bad and constantly checked my email. i was prepared to get a rejection letter or to be ghosted. then around 11 am i got an offer email!! i couldn't believe my eyeballs lol. 

the location is great, the pay is over 45% more then what i was getting, i get to wear jeans, and i get benefits!! 

i'm so glad i took that risk and can't believe i got such a good paying job with a political science major. 

i can't wait to buy a new outfit and buy a beer with my first paycheck. it's been way too long since i had a meal other then ramen and eggs. i'm so relieved that i can pay of my student loads and start trying to bring my credit up.


edit- 

i want to really thank everyone for congratulating me! i feel extremely excited and motivated by everyone's good words and i am so happy to be able to share this with people since i really didn't have anyone to tell! 

i am also glad this motivated people who are also still searching for a job. don't give up, and don't sell yourself short! 

thank ya!! :d",12
"i experienced my first kiss last night. i'm a 19 year old male who went on a date last night. this is the first time i've hung out with this girl outside of work. we basically spent the whole date talking and getting to know each other. the last 15 minutes were the highlight though. we were sitting in my car listening to music and we started to share really personal stuff with each other to which i brought up the fact that i've never kissed a girl. she originally thought i was kidding but i reassured her i wasn't. she wrapped her arms around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder saying she didn't want to go home yet. i was terrified, i didn't know if i should make a move but i knew deep down i would hate myself if i didn't at least try. i asked if i could kiss her, she sat up and asked if i really wanted her to be my first kiss. she was surprised but in a good way. i said i was positive. we kinda stared at each other for a minute and then i just went for it, i leaned in and kissed her for about 3 or 4 seconds. she smiled afterwards and then went back to laying her head on my shoulder with one arm wrapped around my arm while she held my hand with the other. some of the best 15 minutes of my life.

tl;dr - i experienced my first kiss with a girl.",12
"i've gone 2 full days with no fast food or regular soda!!. i know it seems stupid but i've been addicted to fast food and soda since i was very little. i grew up in a household where i was given soda at 6 months and fast food as soon as i could eat. i'm finally over 300lbs and a single mom. i'm doing this for us. i won't have my daughter feel the way i've felt my entire life. small changes first! this is the hardest change for me but i'm ready. i just wanted to tell someone. thanks for letting me get it off my chest!

edit: i never expected this to blow up the way it did! thank you strangers for all the support and encouragement! i've never had this kind of support in my life. i'm so grateful for everyone who read my post and left me tips and nice words. today is day three. if i feel like eating bad or drinking soda i will come back to this post and read all these comments.

"so, i just started reading a book to my girlfriend.... my (long distance) girlfriend has always liked going to sleep to the sound of my voice. every night, even when she's about ready to collapse from exhaustion, she'll call me up, crawl in bed, set up her camera so we can see each other, and wait for me to start talking. she says it's comforting and that she doesn't like being/feeling alone when she drifts off. i don't mind, she's so sweet and watching her slowly fall asleep is the goddamn cutest thing ever. 

and so, for the past year, i've tried a lot of different things; sometimes i'll make up a story as i go, other times i'll just tell her about my day or what's on my mind. you name it, i've probably done it. recently however, she told me that she wanted me to read her a story. i can't believe i didn't ever think of that! of course i said yes, i even drove all the way to her place to pick up a book of her choosing from her sizable collection.

last night we started reading the tale of despereaux together and i've never been more happy. it's small things like this that remind me of how much i love her. she relished every second of it; sometimes she'd ask me to give certain characters goofy voices, other times she'd sit there in a tense silence waiting to hear what happened next as i flipped the page. in the end, when she was only about half awake and only occasionally murmuring, i whispered my normal good night.

""good night, i love you so much!! have good dreams and a nice day tomorrow, i'll talk to you later.""

after barely managing to mumble out the sweetest ""i love you to,"" i've ever heard she went to sleep. it was so perfect, it was as if we were living out a charming love story of our own. now all i can think about is tomorrow night, i just want to spend more time with her. i want to hear her giggle at my bad french accent, i want to see the particular face she makes when a character she doesn't like does something, most of all i just want her to wake up so i can tell her how much i love her. she really is a blessing, i'm lucky to have someone so kind and pure.

tl;dr: my girlfriend wanted me to read a book to her, it went very well. i love her to bits.

edit: i took a brief nap and damn did i reach a helluva lot of people. thanks for all the lovely vibes, recommendations, and even my first ever reddit gold this'll only make our story time that little bit sweeter when we do it again tonight. i'm glad this post was able to touch so many people; love is contagious and anything i can do to spread it around a little bit is good by me. love y'all so much!!",12
"i just spent 3 hours with the newly arrived refugees from syria, and they made me cry.. excuse any spelling mistakes, i'm on mobile.

yesterday 78 refugees arrived in my small town in germany. many people have already been talking about how dangerous they will be and women will be disrespected by them and they'll kill us. that type of ignorant bullshit.

my friend went yesterday to the encampment, inside what once was a small shopping center. she said the men were so nice to her and her daughter that she wanted to go again today to see if they needed help with anything else. i asked if i could go as well to help.

we arrived there at around 9:30 and most of the men were still sleeping. i thought it would be rude to take pictures so i didn't get any of the inside... but just imagine a place where the walls are white and inmates are put 4 to a cell in bunk beds, and each ""cell"" was sectioned off with metal fences they use for construction sites, with some white plastic attached to it so the men had privacy from anyone walking in.

my friend had brought cigarette lighters for the men since all of them smoke (except the youngest, 16). the people in charge didn't really know what to do with us, but then i told them my first language is english, and they right away brought us to a syrian doctor who could speak excellent english. 

he told me what the refugees needed and i translated that to the boss running the encampment. at one point some men told him they needed shoes, because theirs were falling apart (literally). we split the people into groups because others wanted to go get groceries, and others wanted to take the bus into town for other stuff. we went with the group to get shoes and jackets.

5 men came with us. they all had thin jackets on and no umbrella,  and it was raining like cats and dogs as we were walking.  they got completely soaked on the way over. i had an umbrella and didn't use it because i felt shitty that i could stay dry and yet they would get soaked. however, one of the guys (a 16 year old) told me in hand gestures that he would hold the umbrella for me, and he held it over us the whole way to the store.  and i'm supposed to believe now that all muslim men disrespect women? no. never again. 

in the store my friend bought them umbrellas, because their money that they had (200 euros for one month) could be spent on better things. she doesn't earn much either, and i thought that was really kind of her to do.

on the way back i was trying to learn some arabic words, and i asked about mama and papa. one guy said his mom and dad are in syria still. then he said brothers, showed me two fingers, and then made a shooting gesture and said is. he said freedom as he showed me the gesture for handcuffs, and said ""gone"". i cried. i looked at him and the brother that is still living (the 16 year old) and i fucking could not stop crying. these poor fucking men. they have nothing but broken shoes and a few clothes, had a third of their family fucking killed by is, and then they get stared at by fucking germans with looks of disgust on their faces. 

i apologized to the two brothers. it made them sad to see me sad,  they said. they called me ""sadiq"", which means friend in arabic, and that touched me. they showed me pictures of their mom and dad and little sister and asked if they could take pictures with me so they could send them to their families. i'm glad that they and their families know there is someone here that wants to help them.

fuck stereotypes. these people want to be happy just like everyone else in this fucking world. and even though i only helped them by showing them where the store was, i hope that they know now that there are people here in germany that want them here. i want these men to be safe, to be able to go back home one day to their families and be fucking happy.

i wish with all my heart that everyone in this world would want the same for everyone else.


edit: i just would like to also say that there are *so* many people in germany who want to help the refugees. just today alone i picked up 10 bags of men's clothes from different people for me to donate to their living place. i mentioned they needed electric kettles to my son's oma, who isn't a fan of refugees, and she offered the two that were in the cellar for me to take. the people here are overall good people, but some buy in to what the media or hate groups say about the refugees. if they'd just take the time to help their minds would be changed. at least, i hope they would be...",12
"i never knew one sentence could end a marriage so abruptly.. i (31f) have been married for 5 years. i love my husband very much, but lately hes been really mean and disrespectful. i can't talk to him about anything concerning us without him flipping out and getting mad. we haven't shared a bed in 3 years and our sex life is next to nonexistent. we don't communicate well and its just getting toxic. we have two children together, and i have an older son with my ex. 


when my husband and i argue it escalates quickly so i always try to remain calm. if it gets bad enough, i take my kids to my moms house until things smooth over. tonight, my husband pushed it too far and i'm seeking a divorce asap. we got into an argument because i was wiping down the counters and his phone went off. so i picked it up, took it over to him and said ""your mom just texted"". he flipped and immediately assumed i went through his phone. i didn't. i happened to see a text come in because he has his notifactions turned on (oops my mistake). 

i asked him why it was a big deal, and he said ""cause i pay the fuckin bill. stay out of my shit"". i'm spent at this point so i just walk away. i hear him mumbling under his breath and slamming things around so i go back. i asked him if its ok if i take the kids to my moms for awhile and he said fine. i let my daughter play with my phone on the way to my moms. by the time we get there, hes texted me going off and calling me names. unfortunately i'm used to that part so i just brushed it off. 

my oldest son from my previous relationship is autistic. i meant to mention that sooner. anyways, brushing off his earlier comments pissed him off so his texts started getting worse. then he sends me the worst sentence i've ever read. 

""have fun changing your sons diapers when hes 30"". my son is 11 and is still in diapers at night. i literally gasped when he sent that. i haven't responded. i can't. i have kids with my husband. i can handle him calling me names and shit, (handle, not like lol) but he crossed a line. i'm done.

"good friend rapes my girlfriend while i'm in the house.. sorry for the format as i am typing this on mobile. this happened back in 2015, and to be frank, i haven't really been able to get it off my chest since. tldr is the title.

story is as follows:
we had been out to a good friends 21st birthday. all was going really well until the bar we were at closed and everyone there left for home around about midnight. a very good friend of mine was crashing at my house that night, along with my girlfriend of 3 years.

we got home, opened a few more drinks and continued the party - just the 3 of us. a few hours went by and i decided to head to bed around 3am. my friend and my girlfriend decided to stay up and keep drinking, which was totally fine by me as they could go off to bed at any point they chose.

fast forward 2 hours and i am awoken by my girlfriend in absolute hysterics. she jumps onto my bed and curls up in the corner, trying to tell me through her tears and hyperventilation that my so called ""friend"" had just raped her. it should be known that whilst i was trying to calm her and find out what she was saying, i could hear someone moving around downstairs which i assumed was my friend as we were the only people at home.

i curled her up in bed and told her to stay put. i then ran downstairs, through the family room and to the kitchen, where i see him entering the door, fully clothed and confront him. 

me: ""why is she upstairs telling me that you've raped her?""

him: ""what are you talking about? i've just gone for a walk and have been gone for an hour!""

me: ""then why is she telling me this? don't lie to me, you were the only people in the house!""

him: ""i don't know, she's just being stupid and making stuff up! why would you accuse me of this?!""

me: ""wait here and do not move!""

i head back upstairs and ask my girlfriend what she remembers. i trust her wholeheartedly but as she was drunk at the time, this is the bit i struggle with. apparently she had passed out from the drinking and been woken up with him on top of her, her trying to get him off and him forcing himself upon her, holding her mouth closed. 

when she managed to break free, she ran up to me and told me what had happened, whilst he quickly got dressed and ran outside to make it look like he wasn't even here.

i kicked him out of the house before i did something i would have regretted, and believe me i wanted to. 

the rest of the day consisted of police visits, forensic examination of the scene and tears. you can't even believe how many tears. the police wanted to press charges, but my girlfriend didn't want to. not once did i think she was lying, but i don't think she could have handled reliving it in detail in court. we had all the evidence we needed to press charges, including his dna from inside her.

fast forward to 2018 and we received a call from the police asking if my (now fiance) could testify against him in another court case. he had raped someone else, and this time would be going away. she refused, and i supported her, although it would have been good to see the look on his face as we stood in front of him with evidence from years prior.

these days we are still together, happily married, have bought our own house and are doing well financially. it still haunts me to this day what happened, and what i or her could have done differently to avoid it altogether or the aftermath. i don't think my wife is over it yet. she doesn't want to talk about it, and wants to deal with it in her own way. in my country, if you are a rape victim you automatically qualify for free counselling for the rest of your life. maybe she should take it up, maybe she shouldn't. i'm not sure. but one thing is for certain, i'll be beside her the whole way.

edit: thanks for the silver! also thanks so much for the 99% of you offering support and your kind words. unfortunately the last 1% just want to offer opinions and blame us for not putting this guy away. all i can say to you is that i truly hope this never happens to you or anyone you know, as acting rationally and with full focus under these circumstances is difficult to say the very least. to those of you wondering why we never pressed charges, it is because in a police interview he agreed that ""something"" happened. in court it would only become a he says/she says scenario and would have been difficult to prove to a jury that it was rape. 
in saying that, in new zealand the police themselves can press charges on a perpetrator if they feel they have a strong enough case, but as he agreed that something happened and was quoted in saying that it was consensual, it would have been difficult to put him away. he was put on the sexual offenders register and it went on his record.

"i got accepted into an ivy league school!!!!. i am so shocked. i'm finally accepted into cornell university. i never thought i'd make it to an ivy. since freshman year of high school i have worked my ass off in and out of the classroom, even going to cornell during the summers of the past to meet with professors and admissions counselors so often to where they know me on a first name basis. everyone told me to aim lower but i really reached for this and i made it. considering that i am from a really small town in upstate new york where no one moves farther than an hour away and almost always goes to a community college i am astounded. this feels great especially as a half native american boy off of the reservation i can proudly say i made it out of the little dead end town that consumes everyone in it. this is truly a miracle. god bless.

"i accidentally killed my pet. naw. i can't stop crying.

it was feeding time this morning, and they always go crazy for food.  i was coming to the room, and stepped over the gate, and loki, one of my bunnies, came running and got right under my foot.  i crushed his head.  he started spasming and had blood coming from his mouth.  i immediately grabbed him and held him, and he passed within a minute.

it was a complete accident, but i feel horrible and i can't stop crying.  he didn't deserve that.  he was one of my favorite guys, and i hurt him the worst way possible.  i hope i can be forgiven.",12
"it's been six years since i died.. i don't know how to start this. i wish i could articulate it beautifully and have it be touching, but i'm unsure i'm gifted with that. however, i'll do my best here.  


specifically, seven years ago, my life spiraled down. my best friend since grade school committed suicide, and to cope, i started taking any drug i could find, or get a hold of. over the counter meds, cocaine, meth, heroin, mushrooms, ecstasy, opioids, literally anything i could get my hands on that i could use to drown the pain out for a little while. i'm bipolar ii, and i stopped taking my psychiatric medications in the process of all this and just let it all escalate to hell. as a result, i lost my family's trust for a long time, my boyfriend at the time left me, i was alone. and i wanted it to end. so i knocked back an entire bottle of pills and crawled into bed.  


if it wasn't for my sibling who came to ask me for a cigarette, and found me incoherent, throwing up, and barely conscious, i wouldn't be here. they had to restart my heart. took three times, but i'm here today.  


i'm here today and i'm six years sober, even off marijuana (it's legal for recreational use in my state). i have a fiance, i'm in nursing school, i have a three year old (turning four this month) daughter. i have a happy life. i'm content. you really do have to get worse to get better.  


i still struggle with suicidal thoughts, but there's no intention behind them.   


so if you, any of you, feel like there is no light, there's no way to reach your end goal, i'm your proof that it is possible. keep trying. keep trekking. it'll take a while, but you'll get there. no matter what means you need to use.

i'm rooting for you.",12
"yesterday it was 2 weeks after me and my best friend found his son(3) hanging on a rope on a slide in their backyard.. we just got back from the gym when we walked in the house. his girlfriend was there with 2 of their children, they have 3 but the little daughter was still in school. she was in the living room with the youngest, my friend noticed his other son is not there with his mother so he inmedeatly asked where he is and she told him he was playing in the backyard. they have a playhouse in the backyard with a slide, 2 swings and different ways to climb on to it, i think it is a typical playhouse you see on many playgrounds for kids. he told his girlfriend why she'd let him go alone and she replied that it was only for a couple of minutes and she was heading there as soon as she was done cleaning the youngest, the playhouse is not in eyesview when you are in the house. so my friend mumbles something and went outside to the playhouse, i followed seconds after him with their youngest in my arm. when i got close to the playhouse i heared my friend screaming and yelling and i heared him say my name and that i should call 911, i did not know what was going on at that moment but i knew it was bad,  so i rushed back inside and told his girlfriend to call 911 after i put their youngest down on the floor i rushed back to my friend. when i got to the playhouse i was shocked at first, i saw his 3 year old son hanging halfway in the slide with a rope around his neck and the first thing i thought, he's gone. my friend was in total state of panic and could only scream and cry. as i got closer i noticed his head was blue and again i thought he really is gone. i grabbed on to his body with one hand as i remove the rope around his neck and picked him of the slide, his body had no tension and felt cold, i lay him down on the ground next to the slide and moments after i started cpr. his lips were could and wet and i thought cpr is not going to help him, but i continued for some reason. from here i don't know what exactly happend but what i know is that i saw his mother running towards me and took over the cpr, i was totally fine because i knew she is a fully schooled nurse. i picked up the youngest, she carried him outside when running to the backyard, and walked to my friend who was still in shock and tried to calm him down, by now there was police, firetrucks and a lot of people in the street surounding the backyard. i went back inside with theire youngest so he would not see his brother or the commotion around him.

after 30min or so they left in a ambulance to the hospital. he had a heartbeat before going in to the ambulance and still had when they arrived at the hospital, there they putt him on artificial ventilation and he was in controlled coma. i don't know how i telt about that, is he alive, will he stay like this forever or will he wake up with braindamage? nobody knew at that moment. 

fast forward, yesterday it was 2 weeks after the accident happend and 1 week after he got to go to home, so he is already a week at home, still recovering but damn he is still alive.. never thought it would be possible. as far as they can notice for now it seams that he lost his filter/boarder meaning he does crazy stuff like jumping on the table or just acting goofy but with no limit, his parents have to step in to make sure he ""calmes down"". the other 2 kids are still staying at their grandparents just to take it slow and steady with their 3yo.

i am very happy that he is still alive. a lot of people told me i am the hero in this story, but i sure don't see it that way. after thinking and talking a lot with people who where theire i think that a lot of things happend at the right time so he could live. for example, when me and my friend got out of the gym i told him i wanted to go to the barbershop, he hesitated and told me he first want to go home to drink a shake en then we would take the boys and go to the barbershop. if we went right away his son probably died. and so there are a lot more things that seemed to happend at the right time and as i see it there are many hero's in this story! 

if you lasted this long i want to thank you for reading this and i'm sorry for my english. take care.

edit: he took the rope of one of the swings and used it to slide down, the rope was still connected to the playhouse and it got tangled around his neck when he wanted to slide down. his mother feels guilty, but nobody blaims here, it happend in a moment were she did not see the danger. she played in that same house when she was a child and never thought something like this could happen.

edit2: the boy is doing great! he has passed all of the tests in the hospital. physical he is able to do everything, he does have to build up some more strenght and control in his movements. mentally he is doing great, the only thing is that his boarder/filter is weak or gone(thats uncertain) meaning that he is quickly tired and sometimes exaggerate the typical behaviour of kids his age and needs to be calmed down. but they say it can get better.",12
"i like my crappy life. seven years ago i was 27 and living in chicago with my beautiful girlfriend. i was working a fairly coveted job making 130,000 a year. my girlfriend was pulling in almost 100,000. marriage, buying a home, all that good stuff was right around the corner. 

tragedy stuck and two people really close to me died and it made me question everything i knew. i expressed my hesitation with my life path and she gave me an ultimatum - put a ring on her finger within two years or it would be time to part ways. 

that was best thing she could of ever did. she left a few months later and caused some serious introspection from within myself. she knew what she wanted and i couldn't provide it. 

i look back there now and laugh a little. now i own a sweet 1 br cottage in the woods, but still only 80 minutes from the city. i drag my rickety boat with my rusty suv to fish multiple times a week. i go on the weekdays so it's quiet. i can do that because i work for myself from home - making a modest 60,000 a year, but i am my own boss.

i am relaxed. i am happy. i am healthy. i have met (and lost) some wonderful people. deep down i know that 9-5, a wife, 2.5 kids and soccer practice were not for me and that's ok. 

a part of me does want a kid though, just to tell him it's okay to go off the beaten path, it's okay to aim for something else other than marriage and kids, its okay to climb something other than the corporate ladder. it's okay to listen to yourself.

i wish someone would of told me those things growing up, but i figured them out eventually.",12
"just had sex for the first time, twice!. i (27f) recently left a strict religion and decided to make decisions for myself. after talking to a guy for a few weeks, i decided to have sex! 

he was great and patient and made sure i had a good time, but most importantly it was my decision and i feel so damn free. had sex twice, in several positions, and have never felt more confident in my own skin. 

at 27, i finally had sex and i don't feel clingy, or as though i've lost my value, or anything negative at all.

now to catch up on 10 years worth of sex. woo! ",12
"my dog saved me from making a bad decision last night.. sorry in advance for any rambling. i'm not sure who to talk to about this, or if i'm just making it a bigger deal then it is. also on mobile. 

i went to hang out with my friend last night, just a girls night with some wine. i brought my dog with me because i hate leaving her alone and with wine night there was a chance i would be staying over anyways.

thing did get crazy pretty quickly last night and her boyfriend invited his friends over after dinner. it wasn't a big deal, we all had a merry time drinking, playing games etc. 

i don't remember going to bed, i just remember being in the guest room with my pants off falling asleep, just me and my dog. and then there was a moment when one of his friends opened the door. he kept trying to get into bed with me and i remember saying no, get out. he kept pushing though and walked to the bed and that's when my dog lost it. barking, snarling, showing teeth. he got out of there quick and i fell asleep. 

the whole night she was a total love bug, playing with everyone, letting everyone pet her. she's never had issues with anyone else in my bed before, not that it happens all the time, but generally she just wants to be the center of attention. 

i can't help but to feel like she saved me last night. i don't think she slept a wink because when i came home this morning she went directly to bed and has slept since we got home. 

she'll be getting lots of love and treats today. 


edit: 
i finally had a chance to sit down and talk with my friend about what happened. she told me that her boyfriend tried to convince his friend to not come into my room since the dog was there, and she said that the guy claimed it had ""worked for him before"" so he was determined. he came back stating that all he saw was teeth so that's why he didn't go in, but when my friend heard about the incident the next morning she was furious and told her boyfriend that this guy is not welcome over anymore and when she's hanging with myself (or any of her any friends) he is not welcome to join us. 

overall i'm glad she and i talked, i'm glad my puppy was there to stop him and i hope he learned his lesson, although i doubt it. ",12
"my girlfriend turns me down for sex. ..and i couldn't be more happy about it. we've only been dating for a few months, and she comes from a background with some sexual abuse. she made it clear to me that most of what she had done in the past was done out of feeling obligated to, and not actually enjoying it. with me, she'll initiate sex when she wants it, but she also will turn me down. 

her feeling comfortable enough with me to tell me she doesn't want to do anything makes me so happy. i'm ecstatic that she doesn't feel as though our relationship is sex dependent, and that she's confident enough with me to tell me what she wants.

we haven't been dating for all that long, but this coupled with other factors makes me feel like this is the strongest basis for a relationship i've ever had, and the future of it excites me like nothing else.",12
"mentally healthy people put too much hope in suicide prevention hotlines.. so these people think that tony's wife never listened to him?  that tony didn't have a therapist, or that he didn't take medication?  that he didn't have thousands of hardcore fans, each of them willing to listen to every problem or concern that crossed his mind?  they must think that none of these things were true to suggest that calling some random person who knew nothing about his issues or personal struggles could have magically talked him out of something he has probably been contemplating for a good majority of his life.

imagine if you had a car that broke down.  imagine further that your significant other is handy with a car took a look at it, but was unable to fix the issue.  so then you go to a real mechanic and they look at your car and do what they can to get it running, but it is still having issues despite taking it back to them weekly and paying out the ass.  then imagine that someone tells you not to sell the car but to instead call a mechanic hotline and that they will fix all your problems over the phone by asking you minimal questions and telling you that everything is ok with your car. 

what that analogy doesn't capture though is the absolute weight of that car being broken down, or how long that car has been causing problems.  i am 36 this week; i have had suicidal thoughts since i was 7 or 8.  that is 28-29 years of baggage.  baggage that stuck with me when i had a lot of friends, baggage that i carry to a therapist, baggage that i carried through a happy marriage, baggage that i carry when i am with my daughter, baggage that i medicate.  baggage that is so heavy and integral to my being to expect a random person to somehow come along and pick it up for me would be absurd.

this isn't me saying don't call the number if you are hurting.  i am not saying that it is a useless thing that shouldn't exist.  what i am saying is that just quoting it willy nilly to people who are hurting is a kin to trying to save someone who fell off a boat by just tossing the life saver ring out into the water and not holding onto the rope to pull the person back on deck.  maybe you gave them a little more time or a little break, but you sure as shit didn't rescue them.

it was just natural and comfortable and all my fears and negative build-up in my head about sex just disappeared instantly and it was just really awesome.

"two women changed my life and they don't even know i exist. these two ladies profoundly impacted my life and i will never be able to thank them personally, so i will do it here.

first, to the random teenage girl on the train:

you were talking with your friend. she seemed really depressed because she could not get a boyfriend. i was half listening to the conversation while dozing off and heard you say:

""why do you want a boyfriend so much? what do you think will change in your life after getting a boyfriend?""

that woke me up. at the time, i was obsessing over getting a particular ""dream job"". i was depressed and anxious about it, i was crying over it. i was feeling like such a failure. it was all i could think or talk (and complain) about.

as soon as i got home, i made a list: ""things that i think will change if i get my dream job"".

it ended up being such a long list. i was basically blaming all of life's problems, big and small on not having this particular job. not only that, but i was also putting things ""on hold""' until after i got this job for no good reason. like i needed a particular job title to join a gym or practice my hobby.

so i took that list and started doing everything i wrote down. i started addressing the problems directly and finding outlets for the things i was not satisfied with. i still wanted the job, but my happiness did not depend on it. since then, when i find myself obsessing over a particular thing, i always take the time to think if i'm using it as an excuse to not work on other problems i might have.

thank you, teenage girl on the train. you were trying to help your friend and changed a stranger's life instead.

second, to the woman that lives in an apartment somewhere above me:

you moved to the building shortly after i did. i heard some people move what sounded like a very heavy object up the stairs and you thanking them with such happiness in your voice. and then i heard music. you almost didn't wait for the movers to leave before you started playing that piano. and you kept playing. every day.

every day i heard the piano and i remember thinking ""she plays beautifully, i wish i was that good at my hobby"". and then i felt like an idiot. because i was hearing you play every day while i was wasting time online. so i closed my laptop and got practicing.

i'm trying to build that habit now. sometimes it's hard to find that motivation, sometimes i forget. but every day i hear you play, and every time i stop what i'm doing and practice for a little bit. i'm still not great, but i'm getting better.

thank you, lady who lives in my building. you are just practicing a skill you enjoy and you inspired a stranger to do the same.",12
"i hired a cleaning service and living in a clean home has lowered my depression 95 percent.. for many reasons, including hoarder parents and an abusive childhood, i'm extremely messy. twice in my adult life i (m52) have been threatened with eviction by landlords for being so messy.

my wife and i separated last summer and my place has gone downhill since then. it's such a draining feeling to see a messy living room and kitchen. i can't ever get motivated enough to do it and then it becomes overwhelming to even try once it gets bad.

i hired a cleaning service awhile back and just had my second monthly appointment. my kitchen bathroom and living room are clean. i now can have guests over. i can cook food.

my mood has lifted. it makes me so happy to sit in a clean living room and to use a clean bathroom.

i was here yesterday when the cleaning woman came and she was very cool and nonjudgmental. she said she has adhd and ocd and it helps her with her issues to be able to help people and get paid too.

now my goal is to keep it tidy. i'm cleaning things as they get dirty and not putting it off.

it's like any other psychological issue. unless you have it, it seems like a minor thing but it cripples me emotionally to be this messy

please wish me success at turning this around.

edit: i am overwhelmed by the positive response to this post. i appreciate the kindnesses shown me. to clarify: yes, being messy is nobody's fault but mine. therapy taught me it is tied in with the abuse i suffered as a child but therapy hasn't yet fixed my messiness. when i was living with my wife, we shared the responsibility for chores and i did all the laundry and dishes. we didn't separate over cleanliness issues but rather a combination of other factors.
yes, i should have broken out of these patterns long ago. i've tried. i'm filled with shame and self-loathing over it. but i feel i've gotten a new lease on life and can only go on from here.

"my mother passed away from lung cancer 10 years ago. my dad just told me something about her that is just as terrible as her diagnosis.. a little background about me, i just turned 30 this past may, i just bought a house with my fiancee, of whom i proposed to on the day we closed on the house as a way to symbolically seal our relationship for good. it was a beautiful day, and to say i'm fortunate just isn't truly enough to describe it.

my family is small, but we're very tight knit as of late. my fiancee's family is massive and a little rambunctious. so in that, we find many differences. one of the key differences is that my family doesn't stay apart for very long. we try to interact often despite our busy schedules, and we're very open to each other, within reason.

i thought i knew everything about my mother. my mom and dad, my little brother and i lived a happy life together, my sister is 6 years older than me and she became independent quickly, so i didn't see her very often growing up. so us 4 lived like any normal family for many years, until near the end of my time in high school, when my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

she smoked cigarettes constantly. a pack a day, maybe more. for pretty much my whole life. and it didn't stop even when she was diagnosed. i was furious with her, but she was my mother. what could i have done?

she was too weak to see me graduate, and slowly withered away in a hospital bed at home. one night, my dad told me and my brother that her time was nearing its end, and he told us that it would be best to say goodbye to her. that night, we did. it was very anti climactic, almost as though we were totally prepared for it. i must have been, because a few nights later, it happened.

around 3-4 am, she died in my father's arms. my brother cried, but i didn't. i think i had made peace, but i still felt this depth that i never had before, i felt alone, because she was my best friend.

flash forward some 10 odd years and my dad is standing with me and my fiancee in our new kitchen, he tells us how proud he is of me and how well we've done as a couple, praising us left and right. this is a big deal to me because i've felt underwhelming as a son, as well as an older brother. as he's about to leave he stops and says ""you know, i wasn't sure if i should have this conversation with you and jake (little brother), but it just feels right at the moment. you and your future wife are off to a great start with your lives, and i figured i'd give you some insight on what it is to be married, to be there for your wife.""

he proceeded to tell me that, through most of his relationship with my mother, she struggled with an addiction to heroin. dad would find things missing from time to time, including money from his account, and knew that she was using just from looking at her. it went on for 15 years, and came to a head one night where she told my dad she didn't love him anymore, screaming at him to leave. he almost did, as he was about to walk out she stopped him, and begged him to stay. she apologized up and down, and from what he said, she detoxed in their bedroom, all on her own, over the course of a few days. he said after that it was like they fell in love all over again, that they hadn't been that happy since they met.

it would've been a beautiful ending, but then, cancer happened. we were on vacation in disney world, and she was weak. she barely participated with us, and once we got home, she went to the hospital, and was diagnosed right then. a year or so later, she passed.

i've never smoked, drank, or taken any hard drug in my life, and her cancer was the cause of it. knowing what else she went through has only further cemented my foundation.

"step-dad called me ""him"" today!. i've been out as trans for five years, transitioning for almost two. he and i were walking the dogs when one of them got nervous when i was a bit behind and stopped. irritated, he said, ""stop whining, he's coming!""

it was the first time anyone in my family has referred to me as a man, and i felt elated! i'm very glad he finally sees me as who i am.",12
"kid got kicked out of his lunch table on his birthday and it broke my heart. so today was this kid from my schools birthday. his name is anthony but i like to call him felix. today he went to sit down at lunch and his friends wouldn't allow him to sit with them. they literally said ""you can't sit here"" because some other chick was in his spot. so he went and sat on the floor all by himself. i walked past and asked why he was sitting on the floor and he told me and that shit broke my heart. so i basically dragged his ass to come sit at my table. he got sad and silently cried. it hurt my heart so much. he just kept saying, "" i don't know why they let her take my spot"" and stuff like that. i did everything in my power to cheer him up. i luckily got a smile and giggle out him by whispering, ""it's free real estate"" in his ear lol. but basically, to the people who wouldn't let him sit with you, fuck you. and on his birthday, of all days? he'll be much happier sitting at my table with my friends from now on. and to felix, happy bday buddy, ur one of the only people i actually like in this school

edit: wow! thank you for all the love, and plus, my first silver and gold ever!! thank you all so much! i will be sure to let felix now how many of you wished him a happy birthday, you guys rock!

edit: another award. platinum too!! thank you all! i honestly didn't think too deeply when i invited him over, but you guys have showed me how anyone can make a difference in someone's life with just a small act of kindness.",12
"i complimented a girl today.. she was eating strawberries in class. once she finished, she smiled and asked if i could spot any seeds in her teeth. i froze for a few seconds, then, after stumbling over my words, i managed to say, ""you have pretty teeth.""  yes, eventually i did actually answer the question, but it was only an afterthought. it ended with her smiling but not because she was concerned about her teeth. just to clarify, i'm an adult. downvote me all you want, i'm proud.",12
"i (14m) think i just had the cutest brother sister (17f) moment in school today.. so me and my sister have the same lunch and me and my friends had a big fight earlier that day so i didn't want to sit with them so i went and just sat a table that didn't have anyone there then my sister came over and said ""hey bud want to come sit with me and my friends"" i told her no i'm fine so instead of leaving and going back with her friends she just sat there with me i thought it was cute so i wanted to share it.",12

"my boyfriend cried in my arms. my boyfriends is pretty masculine, wears a beard and is pretty buff and not the kind of guy that is super into cozy stuff. 

so one night we took a bath together and i sat behind him and started washing him. he was  a bit  defensive at first but started to relax after some time. i massaged his head and washed his hair, kissed his neck. we didn't had sex or something i just felt that he needed some love and some body contact. after the bath we didn't talk we just kind of communicated without words. we went to the bedroom and we laid down. he laid his head on my chest and i put my arm around him. after sometime i grabbed a book from my nightstand and started reading to him while stroking his hair with my fingers. after some time i noticed that he was crying. i didn't say anything just put the book aside and hugged him really tight and kissed his forehead. he just said a really quite ""thank you"" and fell asleep on my chest. 

i just wanted to share and tell you guys because i think that doesn't matter how ""manly"" a guy is or how thug he acts they are all just humans after all and need love and care too. we do this now at least once every 2 weeks and he really loves it and our relationship was never so intimit and loving.

sorry for using ""after some time"" so often. english is my second language and pretty much self thought.

"my boyfriend asked me to marry him and i haven't stopped crying since. i have never met anyone funnier, or more caring, than my boyfriend. i am so, so excited to be sharing this man's last name, household, future. 

i can't believe this is happening! every time i catch myself just having normal thoughts or doing day-to-day things, i start crying because i can't believe how lucky i am to be marrying my best friend soon. 

i can't believe he's choosing to spend the rest of his life with me. so, so blessed. ❤️",12
"i stole a lot of money from my parents as a teen, and now i am slowly slipping money into thier belongings to repay them.. when i was a teenager, i was pretty broke like most other teenagers. my family was a bit poor for a while, and in order to support my habits and wants, i would take small bills out of my parents' wallets. never more than i needed, but it surely stacked up over time. i know that they pwe're aware of money going missing from time to time but i was never confronted. i grew up and moved out when i was 20. 

7 years later and i have moved back in with them for the time being until i can get an apartment with my girlfriend. i've changed over the years and regret my past thieving ways. they allow me to drive thier cars from time to time (like today since my truck broke down). they leave their wallets and purse out in the living room. i have been taking cash out every payday, which is every friday, and slipping $20s into their center consoles, sun visors, wallets, and my mom's purse when i can afford to do so. i don't know if they have noticed, but i am going to continue to do so. i have to repay them for the money i took for my own selfish reasons. on top of that, even though they have not asked rent of me, i have been giving them 'rent' money to help atone as well. 

i just hope i can replace what i have taken from them in time.

(ps, i'm a lady)",12
"sure isn't a yes. when hooking up with a friend last weekend, he asked me about sex and i initially didn't give him a straight forward answer. flash forward an hour he brought it up again and i proceeded to say ""sure"". this boy looked me and said ""sure isn't a yes. be clear, it's okay if you don't want to"". thank you for being aware, you're a good guy.

edit#1: thank you to those with kind comments! i just want to say that the reason he asked for a more enthusiastic answer was because my tone was off. 


edit #2: i said sure due to us being friends.  yes, i agree that i needed to be more direct. on one hand, i wanted to, but i was also contemplating what was going to happen to our friendship.

edit #3: whether it ended up happening or not is between us. i understand the interest but the post is focused on consent! thank you!!",12
"today i showered. this is not a big thing for the majority of people, but to me, it's huge. 

i've struggled a lot with mental health in the past and i could feel myself slipping back into a deep dark hole. it's been two weeks since i last showered. 
i've taken time off work because i just couldn't face going in and pretending everything is okay. 

a lot of people won't understand this, but when you're going through it it really is a big deal to do mundane everyday things such as shower or brush your teeth. 

i don't want to go back into the dark place. today i have showered and i'm trying to force myself to go the gym. 

wish me luck.",12
"to the random girl who stopped and made sure i was safe when my boyfriend shoved me, thank you.. you were quiet when you asked if i was safe, because he was right behind me after having just thrown me to the ground. i had mascara tears running down my face. i looked up in shocked when you asked me, because for the first time, i realized that this was not normal. this was not okay. this wasn't a one time thing, just like the other times weren't a one time thing. thank you for helping me realize that i don't deserve this. thank you for the genuinely concerned look in your eyes, because now i know. thank you, kind stranger. i haven't taken any action yet, but awareness is the first step, right?

&#x200b;

edit: update: we broke up. it is taking everything within me not to crawl back to him. i feel alone and heartbroken.  i miss him. but you were all right - he was abusing me, and it wasn't going to stop anytime soon. no more excuses for him. without you all, i would have married this abusive boyfriend.",12
"i let a man come over tonight. he didn't have a condom, so i told him we could still hook up, just no piv stuff. he wasn't gracious.. he brought it back up at every turn. saying he wanted to be inside me, asking me to let him, etc. probably about 6 times and i kept saying ""yeah dude, you don't have a condom. not happening."" i was going down on him trying to finish him when he pulled me on him and tried to put himself in me unprotected and i finally just jumped off of him and told him to get the fuck out of my place. 

he got really fucking defensive. he was like don't be like this, blah blah. and i was like dude i had to tell you at least 5 times that penetration was off the table completely and you literally just tried to penetrate me. and he was just like "" i didn't penetrate u tho. u said no and i stopped"" and i was like yeah i also said no more than enough times before having to fucking yell that for you to know. as a grown ass man that shit is unacceptable . that's more than enough for me to not want you in my fucking house.  

i hate this. i can't stop crying. 

edit: wow, i can't thank you guys enough for your kindness and support. after i made this post i calmed down a bit and went to sleep and waking up to this was so wonderful. thank you so, so much. i hate how many of us have had experiences just like this. sometimes we kick him out, sometimes we don't, and in either case it isn't our fucking fault it happened. i am so proud of each of you and your resilience in the face of such awful circumstances. keep fighting, and remember you deserve just as much support from yourself as you've offered me. i love you guys <3

"left my abusive wife and reported her to the police. now everyone hates me. my wife cheated on me at least 3 times. she berrated me, hurts me, yells at me for the smallest mistakes. 

the last incident was when i caught her sending nudes to some guy and she chased me with a knife. i caught her on video assaulting me while trying to leave and i had reported to the police. 

i files for an emergency protection order as advised by family violence support program. i included my kids in the order.  now she might have criminal charges bought up against her but unlikely i think. 

most our friends sided with her and they post pictures together showing how happy they are. most people we know either believes she is the victim and im the abuser while people who believes me thinks that reporting to the police is a bit too harsh, specially the part where i included the kids in the protection order. 

she had started telling everyone that i had been besting her up over the years hence the reason for her actions and people believe it more than my video evidence, texts, etc. 

if gender were reverse im sure people would be more supportive of me. unfortunately i feel like she wins no matter how hard i fight for the truth. 

i feel lonely, and i feel like i was the one who made a mistake. i never hurt her or even emotionally abused her. yet someone how i'm the one who ends up alone and labeled a bad guy. i

i just want to sleep and pretend this is all a dream.",12
"i let an abused child go home with her abuser. i'm a teacher and i love my job. it's the best job but sometimes it takes a toll. yesterday one of my students came back for the first time since the week prior. she has spotty attendance. she also has lice that has been untreated since the start of the school year.  i was excited she was back but annoyed at her constant absences. 

when she came in, she had ink on her hand. i didn't think much of it. later i realized it was bruising and not ink. i took her to the nurse where she said she had extensive bruising on both thighs as well. she said she was beaten by her mother. it took everything in me not to fall apart in front of her. just watching her curl into a ball while telling us and admitting she was afraid to tell because she didn't want to get taken away again. she said she was worried she would be in trouble for telling. 

i called cps and waited on hold for 45 minutes. when i finally got through, the woman taking the report didn't know what lice was and wasn't familiar with the common household item that was used to hit her. after an hour and a half of hold time and reporting, they said they weren't going to come out today! how?

they must have called the family to say they wanted to see the kid because the mom came to pick her up early. i asked my admin if there was anything we could do and the answer was no. we had done the most we could without committing kidnapping. it broke a little bit of my soul to send her home. 

i'm waiting for my kids to come in right now. they will be at my door in 2 minutes and hope that she's here today. i am not confident she will be. i know they've run away with the kids to other states before to avoid charges of neglect. i also hope that if she comes back she will still trust me and the other staff. 

update: she isn't here nor is the other child. i had not considered calling the police but will on my lunch and will update! thank you for the advice. it's hard to consider the other options when you are told there aren't any. 

update 2: i called cps again and requested a call back for an update but couldn't get through to a real person. hopefully i'll here back soon. i also called the police and asked to check on the welfare. the problem is that the address we have on file is incorrect and i know they live in another city but have this one on record for the school. i don't know their other address. the police are going to her address on file and then will proceed from there. alas, nothing is simple or speedy. 

update 3: i just heard from the school nurse. a social worker was in touch but they deferred to the police. the police caught them trying to flee. they did end up getting them and the student is being evaluated at the hospital and she is being removed from the home!!!!!!!  i'm so happy they found her before they got away. the family is trying all sorts of things to try and confuse the police about what happened, but it will work out.

minor update 4: i told my assistant principal about the call i made just so she wasn't blind sided by it and she was happy i called. i was worried she would be mad that i went around the system but she wasn't. also, she can stay at our school technically. being removed from her house means she is homeless and she is allowed to remain at our school even though she is out of district. it's a little victory that i hope her temporary housing family will help to maintain for her.

"i have been living in poverty for years now. i almost committed suicide a few months ago. i just got an inheritance from my grandmother of nearly 800,000 dollars..  

i  made a lot of mistakes growing up. my parents were drug addicts, and i  did a lot of drugs (not heroin like they did) and alcohol growing up. i  also grew up in a horrendous, violent neighborhood. i struggled with  ptsd from being exposed to so much violence there at a young age,  shootings, beatings, everything imaginable.

at  17, i got a girl pregnant. i tried to be a good father, i really did,  but as the years went by it was just so difficult to provide for them  financially. i spent my entire 20s literally up my ass in bills, paying  for healthcare, rent, childcare etc. me and chelsea (my kids mom) never  got married but we lived in the same apartment building so we basically  were still mom and dad, even though we never actually really were in a  relationship, we still were together, a lot. then she got pregnant  again, by me, when i was 27 years old. i was sort of able to provide  before then, we were poor but not too poor, but after the second kid? it  was just too much. i was scrapping by for literally any money i could  possibly find. i was working 70+ hours a week at low wage jobs. i was  content with my first child, i loved him, but at the same time i wanted  my life to actually begin when he turned 18 and went to college and  such. now a second child? another 18 years of me working to death to  support them? i love my daughter more than anything but i was  distraught, basically suicidal for years after she was born. i was 27  years old, i would be 'free' and finally be able to live my own life and  go to college and get a good career... by 45 years old. the thought of  it was so horrible to even imagine, it felt like i was in a prison.

when  i was 29 years old, i ended up nearly killing myself because of the  stress. not just the work, but everything, i was mentally destroyed.  every single day was like torment. i recovered, but not really by much.

a  year has passed by since i almost committed suicide. my grandmother  died. i never knew her, at all. i knew that she lived in nyc and that  she was a russian jewish immigrant. my mom ran away from her when she  was 19 years old so i never really met her except twice in my life.

turns  out my grandmother left me 773,000 dollars, and she also left me  countless items of inheritance. her apartment in the upper west side of  manhattan, a ton of gold and silver jewelry. when i found out, i just  could not stop crying.

i didn't even tell  my chelsea right away, instead i took our family to a surprise dinner  at a fancy restaurant. she was upset and confused as to how we were  getting the money to afford this, and then i told her and she just  couldn't even contain how happy she was.

its  been 3 months. dealing with the legal process of the apartment and the  inheritance is difficult, but we are dealing with it. we plan on taking  150k and putting it for the college fund of each of our kids, then  taking another 250k and putting it in savings, then we have the rest to  decide what to do with. buy a home most likely. then once we sell the  apartment (worth 1.5 million\~)... then i really don't know what the hell  is gonna happen. its so much money i almost don't even know what the  hell to do.

i am just blown away at this.  everything. it feels like i died and went to heaven. every time i think  about it i just start crying in happiness.",12
"when he didn't show up to our halloween party, we didn't really think anything of it... (suicide trigger warning). then on friday we get a text saying that he died the day before. we saw him on wednesday on his way home to commit suicide. we were walking to class and said ""you're coming to the halloween party tomorrow, right?"" he laughs and says yes. we tell him he can crash on our couch, and he accepts. we chat a little more and he says life isn't going great. we tell him ""that sucks man, we're sorry."" but we had no idea. i didn't think anything of it, i mean we're in college, everything generally sucks right now. we had to get to class and we fist bump and part ways. we tell each other ""see you tomorrow."" that was the last time we saw him alive. we come to find out he went home, took one of his parent's guns, told his parents goodbye, pretending to go off to work, and went to a park and shot himself. 

the world is different now.

i hope you can at least finally rest easy now, camden. we love you and i'm sorry

"i'm sick and tired of constantly being a target to men and i'm even more sick and tired that people see this as something that can't be changed or isn't worthwhile addressing. i understand this site is mostly men and that a good portion of those men probably won't truly understand how ridiculously prominent this is until they've walked in a female's shoes.

i make this post cause i got my first apartment and my dad literally came in and made sure it was ""pervert proofed"" as he called it. 

so like the awesome dad he is, he switched out my door screws and added an extra lock cause the original one isn't a deadbolt, this is standard and not unique to my situation of course. but then he started looking for *camera infrared* cause i guess male landlords will put cameras to spy on female tenants. he also checked for microphones as well. i was disgusted when i found out through my dad that one of his coworkers had gone through the court process cause her pervert landlord had been spying on her. disgusted..but not surprised.

let's continue with other ways i've had to ""pervert proof"" for the majority of my life.

at my old job, women weren't allowed to carry things to people's cars or trash to the dumpster alone. you had to use a buddy system. why? cause a chick at a bestbuy down the street had an attempted kidnapper when he asked her to help with a computer tower.

i cannot go to gas stations past 10pm. i don't go because 3 times now i've had very creepy and threatening experiences with guys trying to ""hit on me"" when really they're just belligerently telling me to ride with them. two of those times i've been threatened.

obviously in college there's a 101 ways women are advised to protect themselves. travel in groups, always watch your drink, don't go home alone, use a friend instead of an uber if possible and if you have to use uber make sure it's your driver and that you can jump out if he turns on you. etc etc.

in highschool my mom always told me to sit at the front of the city bus so that the driver can help me when a man inevitably creeps on me, threatens me, or flashes me. two of those things did happen within a year later. bonus points, she told me to always make sure i'm not being followed when i get off as well. thankfully i haven't been.

in middle school i started to get hit on when i hit puberty and this is when i faced the brunt of male perversion at *twelve* years old and had to learn techniques to dodge it which is despicable. 

now it's rubbed in my face now that girls are used as symbols of commodities for advertisement. what i mean by this is when girls my ages get their tits pushed out and are plastered next to whatever product that needs to be sold. there's a radio ad i hear constantly for a bar that says ""college girls go here"" as a form of advertisement and it's so gross and predatory. 

i hate it. i really do. i understand most male violence is on other guys, but women get the brunt of male perversion and it's terrible and needs to change. societal values have changed before and this isn't an exception. i know if we start frameshifting what is acceptable and normal that less people will do it. won't be gone forever but perhaps i wouldn't have to be constantly plagued by this scenario. 

obligatory ""not all men"" in case someone hasn't deduced that reading this. 

thank you for listening",12
"he blow dried my hair and i started to cry. my mental health is in a pretty bad state almost all the time. months go by where i struggle to do normal things like eating properly or sleeping at a reasonable time. i mostly stay awake till my eyes burn and my headache turns into a terrible migraine, until i finally allow myself to rest, just to feel kinda guilty when i wake up the next morning.  
in the past i got together with guys who just liked me for my looks and my body. when i broke up with my first boyfriend all that he told me was ""shit man, now i am still gonna be a virgin."" he constantly sent me messages with spam bots and called me, harassed my sister and in the end tried to fake a suicide, so i would get back with him out of pity. he started taking drugs that kept him awake so he could work more. he did everything possible to ruin himself, so that he could blame me. 
my second boyfriend lived 600 miles away, so we didn't see each other very often. he pushed me to send him nudes, because ""that's what all good girlfriends do."" he wanted me to get naked while we facetimed and when i did not do it, he pushed me into a fight and made me feel terrible. ""no one is going to love you with your dumb depressed mind"", were his last words before i blocked him everywhere. after that i had something going on with guys, that put a bet on me with their friends or who tried to sleep with me and then ignored me even though we saw each other every day in class. i felt terrible and started to harm myself, thought about the big question, if everything would get better if i just wouldn't be here anymore. after two years of just being at home and struggling with myself and my past i went back to college and in my last year i met my current boyfriend. he saw me when i walked to the train station after class in summer. ""where are you going? hop in, i'll drive you home."" everything started with that sentence. he constantly tried to make me happy, helped me with my problems. he was here for me. he bandaged my wounds, bought me food, was patiently waiting while i ate. i went on my first concert with him, had the best summer of my life and started loving myself a little bit. recently we had a kinda bad fight. we sat in bed and both cried while discussing our problem. i needed to shower, so he went with me, even though we were angry at each other. i was exhausted and fell in bed. after a short while he started to blow dry my hair, massaging my scalp. he kissed my head and told me how much he loved me and that we will work towards a solution. i instantly started to cry out of happiness. i never had experienced such a honest love and understanding. he stayed, we talked. no one screamed, there weren't any threats, just love and the need to solve it. i fell asleep and when i woke up again he was still there, rubbing my neck to make sure i feel comfortable. i think i found him.   i hope everyone finds someone like him.

"i cannot stand boomer work culture. i work at an office where i am, by quite a few years, one of the youngest people in the company. it is also relatively small, so i frequently see my boss's boss, and even work with them directly for some things. however, the other day, he saw me at my desk on my phone checking news and email, when i should have been ""working"". the problem was that it was literally 10 minutes before 5 (which is when i usually leave) and i had basically committed to staying an extra hour to handle an account who decided to work with us last minute. i was on my phone because i was simply waiting to hear back from this account so i could actually do some work. but my boss saw me on my phone, instead of twiddling my thumbs like a good 'ol boy and complained to my direct supervisor. and a few minutes later she pulled me into her office (when i actually had gotten word back from my account and was actually trying to get work done) to chastise me for not ""looking busy"" even though she knew i was working and was simply waiting on my client to respond. they decided to actually waste my time when i was actually busy to reprimand me for not looking busy for a measly 10 minute window even though both knew i was simply waiting to hear back from someone. their problem wasn't that i wasn't doing anything, it's that it ""looked bad"" that i was on my phone rather than staring at my computer monitor like some sort of mindless drone, waiting for an email to come in.

my bosses also frequently brag about how little they sleep and how few days off they get in a given year. it's pathetic, and i appreciate how people my age actually don't want to give their lives in full to their jobs and become wage slaves like our parents and grandparents. i'm in at 8 and out by 5, and i don't work weekends, period. yet my bosses get angry if i don't respond to redundant emails on my days off that have no reason why they can't wait until monday morning.",12
"so guys...my boyfriend lied to me again and i am jumping with joy!. so. 
he has lied and cheated multiples times. i was trying to trust him ...he said he wants to build my trust but i have been suspicious. then after many suspicious events, today he lied again. 100% lied. he had someone at his place and he wouldn't video call me for 19 minutes after a whispering call. 
so the reason i am joyful is that i am done ...i am free. no more him. 
i don't have time try and save a relationship in so much pain. he is a deceiver. and i can go back to my life. which is simple beautiful and just ok. 
he would be an amazing husband but what would i do with his pampering and affection and fun, if i never feel safe?

so i was sad and heartbroken

"to the ulta employee who called my acne horrible. it's been four days and i'm still not over it. i went to you to get a facial for my acne and instead you called it horrible and treated it like it's contagious. guess what, this is the clearest my skin has been in months. i'll continue working towards my skin and will no longer seek your opinion. i've found another facial person who is much nicer than you.

"my stalker died this last week and i am relieved.. i (38f) realized someone (65m) was stalking me a few years ago. he ended up being extremely dangerous, he was on parole after serving 7 years for attempting to murder a woman by beating her over the head with a wine bottle, breaking it on her head, slashing her back with the broken bottle, strangling her, and attempting to rape her before she was able to escape him. i sent this man back to prison for stalking me and attempted sexual assault in 2017. i went to every hearing i could, i wanted him to know i would not back down and that i was never going to. he was paroled again in may of this year. i had signed up for updates through a victim notification program and had a restraining order against him. i received a call 3 days ago from the notification program letting me know he died. i started laughing and crying at the same time while i was talking to the woman from the notification program. i feel some guilt for being happy about his death but at the same i am relieved that he cannot hurt anyone ever again.",12
"i finally signed up for college today. at the age of 32 i'm actually going to make something of myself.. my mom was neglectful and my dad was always telling me i would never amount to anything. calling me stupid and dumb always making fun of my weight and anything else he could point out that he thought was a flaw. i never thought i would actually make it to this point. my ptsd and anxiety has held me back for so many years...but i did it guys. some day i'm going to be able to help children that are going through what i went through. i'll be able to let them know that it's going to be ok and that they have someone looking out for them. 

edit: wow! thank you all so much for the kind words you have no idea just how grateful i am for every single one of you. ",12
"i was finally able to let the mother of the boy whose murder i witnessed know her son didn't die alone. last fall, a young man was shot and killed on our sidewalk while my husband, our friend, and i were standing less than 30 feet away on the other side of a privacy fence.

it all happened so fast. a car pulled up on the road that runs by our backyard. someone got out. people were talking, there was no escalation in the conversation, no anger. it wasn't a fight. gunshots just started going off. a moment of silence, then the car sped off into the night.

my husband and our friend called 911 while i went to the fence and saw someone lying facedown on the sidewalk. i honestly thought he was dead at first, until he took a gasping breath. i crouched down next to him and gently rubbed his back. i started talking to him, even though he wasn't conscious, telling him he'd be okay. i stayed with him until i had to flag down the cop car and they began trying to save him.

he passed away shortly after. i don't know when. i just know the ambulance left in silence. we were interviewed by detectives that night and never heard anything else about it until last month when my husband and our friend got served subpoenas.

i have thought about that boy every day. i wondered what his family is like, what his laugh sounded like, i wanted to know his name. most of all, i wish i could let his mom know her boy didn't die alone on the sidewalk. i wrote her a letter the day after it happened and then i realized i had no way of getting it to her.

i didn't know any case details. i didn't even know his name. i couldn't find anything online. i couldn't find any obituary, news article, or police reports about the incident. i didn't know anyone involved. he was like a ghost to me. the only reason i knew it had actually happened for a long time was the bullet hole in our fence and the fact there were two other witnesses, though it was rarely discussed amongst ourselves.

the guys reported to court and my husband talked to one of the other witnesses. she was a friend of the kid and she made it clear her and the family didn't know much of the details as to what happened to him that night other than he was shot and left to die.

i got hammered drunk that night and wrote her a letter for my husband to give her the next day. i tried to keep it short and spared her any gory details. i just let her know i was by his side within seconds of the car fleeing and i was by his side until first responders got there and that he didn't spend his final moments alone.

i left it to her judgement as to whether the family, especially his mom, would want to know that. my husband saw her hand the letter to his mom shortly after she read it, so i feel reassured i made the right call.

my heart is broken, but i finally feel a bit more at peace about it. i don't know if knowing a stranger was there next to him will be any comfort to them, but i hope so.

i hope his mom gets in touch with me. i want to know more about her boy. i want to know his name. i want to see a picture of his smile. i want to give her a hug. i want her to know her son will never be forgotten. ",12
"i don't think anyone really cares but damn i fucking love my girlfriend. it's my birthday today and i was meant to got to sleep 3 hours ago because i'm doing stuff tomorrow (technically today) for my birthday but i'm still up because i got a notification saying ""your memories from 2 years ago today"" 

it was a photo of me and my girlfriend on my birthday 2 years ago when we had been together around 7 months and i've spent the last few hours crying looking through old photos and listening to all our favourite songs. say whatever you want about it, i don't care i fucking love that girl with my heart and she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

i am 1 month sober from alcohol today. today marks the day that i (m19) am a month sober from alcohol. i have severe liver disease and my doctor told me that i have to stop drinking so that my liver can attempt to repair itself. i just went to the health services and got my blood drawn for tests. i will know in three days if my results improved or not. i know a month isn't long but it feels like a big accomplishment to me. i don't feel any different than when i was drinking. my friends and family don't seem to care so i thought i would type it out here.,12
"teaching can kiss my ass.. i 38/f am done. kids won't even take their earbuds out of their ears long enough to listen to the short lecture or instructions. i have sorely lost the war against cell phones. the entire time i'm talking, they're sneaking their phones. it doesn't matter how engaging or student-centered or interactive i make the lessons, they do not care. i have worked in three districts and i run into the same nonsense everywhere. 

i have to chase students down to even get the easiest assignments turned in. between missing work, chasing down absent students, having to reteach the lesson to tardy students...nothing productive is accomplished. i have been screamed at by parents because i gave their child a zero for printing his essay off the internet. i have been swung at, cursed at, flipped off, and sexually harassed. you name it, it's happened. i've cultivated great relationships with many of my kids, but i am still putting in zero after zero in the gradebook and begging them to put their phones away (admin doesn't support us taking them.) 

i teach high school and have kids in my class that cannot read or write a complete sentence. i have to modify everything for kids with ieps, leaving the high achieving kids unchallenged and bored. i am only one person, and the system is completely broken. 

the rewards of this job are so profoundly outweighed by the disrespect, poor pay, required overtime, student apathy, and utter emotional turmoil. i find myself wanting to drive off the side of the road rather than make it to school. i cant eat, sleep, relax. i have nothing left for my own three children or husband. i'm out.

edit: it is not the fault of students with ieps. it's the absurdity of the idea that teachers have to teach every level of learner at the same time.",12

"i am a convicted felon, recovery from 6 years of stimulant abuse & i start back to college next week for the first time in 8 years. i just bought a backpack :). i went to college when i was 18 but they didn't offer a degree in.....hallucinogens.

i am 28 years old. my background is going to prevent me from going into a lot of fields.

if anyone has advice about a good field for a felon, please let me know.

i'm worried that everyone will be able to tell that i've been to prison, or that i've been deeply involved in my past with drugs. i've been clean for over 3 years now.

\*\*edit: thanks for all the positive messages! everyone has been great, i'm really surprised at the high response!

\*\* edit #2.  thanks again everyone. i'm driving all day but i will go through and read each reply this evening along with replying to many of you. thank you for the encouragement. it's really heart warming!!

***\*\*final edit:***   i am more optimistic about the future having interacted and spoken with many of you. i have read each of your comments (more than 300), i have saved many of your replies and words of encouragement so i can refer to them later. i feel that i have experienced the very best of the internet today. most people are so quick to brush past those with a background like mine. several of you sent me reddit ""gold"", and nearly all of you have touched my heart in a way that i needed right here at the start of my journey.

some of you are in my position, many of you have family and friends that have been in my position. people from every field of study and practice gave me advice in addition to others who sought out information just so they could share it in the comments.

reading your replies have kept me smiling all day long and will keep me motivated long into the future. never underestimate how even a short phrase of encouragement can impact even a total stranger. i've learned something from this post that i didn't intend. it doesn't matter what i do with my college education. the world has enough successful people. if i can muster an ounce of the compassion that was expressed towards me here for the benefit of others thats where the real ""gold"" is found.

thank you everyone.

"i wanted to kill myself today, but i decided to tell people how much i appreciate them instead. everyone i've had a positive interaction with. even if i only met them once, or if we haven't spoken in ages. anyone that came to mind, i messaged them and said thank you, and wished them happiness in the future and a great day today. i tried to add little stories that i remembered about hanging out with them if i had any.

i've always heard that when you feel like you have nothing, you should always try to remember the things you do have. so i spent 2 hours sending people (what is hopefully) a nice message for them to wake up to later today. i also couldn't stop thinking about people like me who paint a nice picture on social media but are actually pretty miserable in day-to-day life.

i actually really do feel better now after putting positivity in the world instead of negativity. i didn't self harm and i didn't try to end my life.

yeah the feeling of despair hasn't gone away, but now i can also remember that i'm not completely worthless, and i can still put beautiful things into the world too :)",12

"victims of rape should not be held financially responsible for any exams or evaluations. long story short, my friend was raped last night and she told me the hospital made her sign a waiver saying she was responsible for all charges. are you fucking kidding me? how the hell is that acceptable? all i want to do is find the coward that did it, beat his ass and drag him to hospital and have him pay. this is why rape is almost never reported. not only is there almost no evidence in most cases, but the system feels like it's working against the victims. i've never been so fucking mad.

i've never been to this sub but judging by the rules, my post might be removed because of my language.  i just need to vent this frustration.

edit: you guys have been really helpful and kind. i'll sit down with her later and go through some of these suggestions. thank you again.

edit 2: i gave her the link to this post since you guys were so incredibly helpful. i wanted to show the support you all brought. she was handed some sort of victim's compensation form to fill out and she said some random lady was at the hospital with a stuffed bear for her but disappeared. i don't know if this was rva but if it wasn't, she will follow up with them as well. thanks guys.

"i hate the 9-to-5 worksociety. i legit can't handle this much longer. the monotomy of this life is sending me in a downward spiral.

how are people okay spending 8 hours a day doing the same thing, in the same musky office, saying ""morning"" to the same people, drinking the same trashy coffee and not achieving anything worthwhile just being the cog in a machine that has no further purpose than to make money? having to act professional for no reason at all. people ask how you're doing but saying anything else but ""great! you?"" will get you fired or shunned.

"i left the hospital without my baby today. adoption.. my beautiful baby girl was born on may 4th. she is very healthy, has a head full of hair that's the exact same color as the dads, and she's so calm. 

i gave birth with the adoptive parents and my mom and boyfriend in the room. we all gave her lots of snuggles, and i breastfed her for the two days we stayed at the hospital. 

this afternoon i was discharged and had to say goodbye. i breastfed her one last time before i left, and just have her lots of kisses. another baby was born as i was leaving the hospital so that made me smile for the family and the nervous looking dad. 

i've been at home now just cuddling with my boyfriend as we process and deal with this. it's gonna be a long road, and my recovery kinda sucks right now it's defiantly kicking my butt. i'm so sore and tired. 

i got to take her first pacifier and hat and i've not been able to let go of it. i don't know when i'll be able to. i'm just so thankful she's alive, happy, and well loved and taken care of.",12
"i have to choose whether to end my sister's life.. my sister and i grew up in a very broken home. our dad was never around and my mom was an alcoholic who couldn't hold a job. when i got to be about 15, i started work to make sure my little sister could eat every night. i went to school and worked night shifts at the local market to provide for her. i eventually dropped out of school to work full time so she and i could move out. she's currently 11, and i'm 20. at the age of 18, i decided to fight for custody of my sister so she and i could leave my very absent mother. our mother immediately signed custody over and seemed relieved. 

she and i got an apartment and now we're much happier. we don't worry about the gas going out or not having electricity. my mom frequently brought men over to sleep with for money, and i lied awake every night making sure they didn't try to touch my sister. we had mold and other problems, and my sister developed asthma. 

she's kept it controlled, but certain things trigger her asthma and send her into coughing fits. i've taken her to the er when it's bad off. 

two weeks ago, i got a call at work. it was the local hospital telling me my sister had been found unconscious, without a pulse, in the school bathroom. they called 911 and began cpr, and continued en route to the hospital. they successfully got a pulse, but she remained unconscious and has since been intubated. 

she's had numerous mris and scans, and they all say the same- she was without oxygen for 8 minutes, and she has no brain activity. she's not brain dead, but she isn't awake. she's in a vegetative state and likely won't come out of it. 

since i have full custody of her, i have to choose whether or not to retract her life support and let her go. she's been my world and i can't even focus at home because she's gone and her laugh doesn't fill the house. i don't know what to do without her. i'm holding onto the small sliver of hope, but i can't be selfish. i don't want to let her go, but she shouldn't be held here because of my selfish desire.",12
"i was raped by a girl and everyone thinks it's funny. tl:dr got raped by a girl at university, everyone just brushes it off and thinks it's funny and/or that guys can't be raped

to give some context: i'm a male, college student, 21 years old. this happened about a year ago.

i'm at the club nearing the end of a night when a familiar girl comes up to me and tells me she lost her keys, all her friends went home already and aren't replying and she's way to drunk to sleep on the street. since we've met before and i'm close to some of her friends i suggest to her that she can sleep in my bed and i would sleep on the floor. i just figured it would be easier than trying to contact her flatmates.

we go back to mine, mind you i'm pretty drunk at this point but still functioning, i tell her to sleep on the bed and i'll have the floor. she tells me i can sleep in the bed that she doesn't mind. i have a king size bed so i agree, i go one of the ends of the bed turn around and fall asleep.

in the morning, i kindly ask her to leave when i wake up and even call her a cab. as soon as she has left i go to the bathroom and that's when i see myself in the mirror. hickeys all over my neck, chest and abs. at this point i'm very confused, cause i had not gotten with anyone that night. i remember going to sleep very clearly even though i was drunk, i wasn't black out. i look around my room and i find a condom wrapper open, i didn't find any used condom though (she took it? possibly to hide it?).

i call one of her friends the next day, after i slept over it and processed what happened and he tells me she told her best friend we had sex. that shook me. 

for about 6 months i wasn't able to have one night stands, i wouldn't trust a girl i didn't know to be around me. even know a year later i still find it very hard and whenever i do end up having sex it's always with someone i built some rapport with and am very comfortable around. which is a complete turn around of who i was before that event. i was completely broken, i used to cry myself to sleep some nights, i've never felt so gross. eventually i started getting better, that is until now...

i finally told my friends about what happened and why i had that sudden chance of personality. they laughed at me. i got comments telling me i'm a guy so i can't be raped, comments saying ""so what?"" as if the fact that it ended in sex and i should be thankful for. and even to people straight up stop being my friends because they were friends with her. i never confronted her because i cut her off my life and wherever she goes i just can't be around. 

i just needed to get this out! i cut all those people that reacted that way out of my life, and i hope i made the right decision, it made me lonely right now but it's definitely better than being around people who belittle this situation that fucked me up so much.

edit: the response here has been overwhelming good! i'm so glad i decided to post here, everyone is been so supportive. thank you so much, i wish i had the time to reply to each of you individually and say thanks. i've booked an appointment with a therapist to talk about it since it seems like a great idea. again, thank you! it means a lot me.",12

"i (m15) just got adopted (on halloween). so for background info, i until was a foster child for two years until i got adopted today. all of my life i was abused, neglected and surrounded by drugs. i still have scars and burn marks on my back from the abuse. my father left me when i was six months old, and got bullied all my life. and at one point i tried ending my life because it was getting too horrible. at that point i was pulled out of the homeless shelter i was staying in, and put into foster care. since then, i joined the cross country team in high school, and track, and playing flute for the band. i went from failing every single class to straight a's. also recently, as of nine months ago i got a boyfriend. the case finally close today, i completed all of my goals for therapy, and am currently working on basic skills such as cooking (scary). and coincidentally on halloween i just got adopted. this is the closest to a caring family i have ever gotten. and my amazing boyfriend is so supportive of me, and i am happier than i have ever been. i didn't think my life would get better but i was proven wrong.

"my wife is blind and i wouldn't have it any other way. i got married to my girlfriend of six years last month, shes has no sight whatsoever, and i wouldn't have it any other way. 

you see. there are things about her blindness that are so adorable, funny and cute. every time we are in the same room i gently reach for her hand or touch her shoulders so she knows i'm in the same room and i see her face brighten up every single time. 

supporting her blindness, and serving her as a partner and now husband makes me so happy. it's become such a pleasure and joy that if she became a sighted person, while i would be happy for her, part of me would wish to go back.

"i saw a stranger with a blanket i made yesterday. last year i was able to do a nice thing for some community members. i was homeless and made a poor flipping decision on polar fleece (flipping - buying and selling as side income). essentially, shipping costs would have killed any margin and local wasn't working.

so i took the downtime i had at a night job and made double fleece no sew tie blankets and handed them out to fellow homeless people after shift one morning at a food pantry when the frosts were hitting.

it was a brief experience but positive. i made about two dozens people's mornings with a clean new blanket while waiting in the cold.

yesterday, around a year later i saw a homeless person walking down the street with one of those blankets. the fabric choice, my poor technique, all of it. i'm sure i've never seen this person before so that blanket went on a journey and is still providing comfort to someone.

i'm not homeless anymore, but times are hard, and seeing that really brightened my day. i just wish i had some more fleece now.",12
"what my sister will never know. tonight was probably the worst st. patrick's day i've had yet. i was the dd for my younger sister 21f and her friends. we had plans to go to this club in detroit. before we went to the club we stopped at her friends apartment so they could pre-game. my sister was driving at the time because she was sober still and ended up parking in someone's reserved spot.

fast forward an hour or so one of her friends gets sloppy drunk and is throwing up outside. i go to check on him and notice my sisters car wasnt there, so i go inside and tell her. turns out her car had gotten towed by the people who the parking space belonged to. so we all pile into one of her friends car and drive to the tow lot. 

they ended up charging her 380 dollars for her to get her car back. the whole time she is sobbing in the back because she didn't have the money. by this time the night was pretty much ruined so we asked her friend to give us a ride home. 

on the way home she is trying to figure out how to pay the money to get her car, and one of her friends dad (who is trying to sleep with her btw) tells her he'll pay for it, in exchange for a date. once we get home she tells me she is going to do it and i finally talked her out of it because that's... well that's something i never want my little sister to have to ever resort to. 

we moved some money around and finally figured out what to do, so i drove her back to get her car. we split ways and are going to meet at mcdonald's to get some food to make us feel better. while i'm sitting in the mcdonald's parking lot waiting for her i get a phone call from her that she was pulled over and blew a ,074 which is .006 below the legal limit. so she luckily doesn't get a dui, but i have to come pick her up because the cop wasn't going to let her drive her car home.

we had to ditch her car in a liquor store parking lot, and the cop tells us that if we don't move the car before 7 am the owner will tow it. he gives her a ticket for speeding and then send us on our way. 

by this point my sister has probably had the worst night of her life and hits a low that i havent seen her hit in a long time. she used to cut herself and i knew it was on her mind. i assured her that i would get her car back and not to worry. she didn't want to tell our mom because she'd flip, so i told her i'd figure it out. 

i sat up with her until she fell asleep to make sure she didn't cut, and then bundled up and walked around 8 miles to get her car from the liquor store. she will never know that i walked that far to get her car back. and i don't want her to. tonight was horrible for her and i just couldn't bare it getting any worse. sorry this is such a long post, but i just needed to get tonight off my chest. 


edit: thank you so much for the support! family always comes first in my eyes, and i'd do anything for them. i'm sure she would have done the same for me. and i'm her brother, i forgot to identify my gender in there. oops ! 

edit: also as some of you pointed out she was driving under the influence, which i feel like was partly my fault because i let her take her car home, we had to get it that night tho or the price was going to keep going up. still inexcusable and i don't have much sympathy for her receiving a ticket or anything either. but i couldn't let her get her car towed twice 🤷🏼‍♂️",12
"dating the opposite sex does not make me any less bisexual. thank you, that is all.",12
"to the girl who was horribly bullied and abused in high school. i still think about you and i am so sorry.. this was back in the mid 80s, my high school years were straight out of a john hughes movie. i have so many happy memories but every once in a while i am plagued by memories of sarah. this will be very long, i have a lot to get out. **the tl;dr is that i had a friend who vicariously lived her life through me because she was being abused in every way at home and at school. i am wracked by guilt still decades later about what more i could have done.**

abuse, sexual assault and suicidal trigger warnings.

i met sarah on the first day of freshman year. she was the tallest girl i had ever seen.  she was slim, freckled and had a head full of corkscrew curls, bright orange-red, that fell down passed her shoulders. everyone snickered and whispered. but i said ""wow, i love your hair, so pretty!"" and went up and touched one of the springy curls. sarah slightly recoiled and blushed bright red but then burst into a huge smile and said ""thanks."" i said ""very choice"" and sat down. she took the seat behind me, that was how i met the girl who i haven't been able to stop thinking about 31 years later.

sarah didn't dress like my friends and i. or like any of the cliques in school. i was this post punk pre goth who was lucky enough to be alive when that music was in its heyday. my basic ""uniform"" was docs, knee socks, short skirt, band shirt and a bomber jacket. sarah always thought everything i wore was the most amazingly cool article of clothing she had ever seen. when in reality i looked like every one of my girl friends and actually my guy friends too, just exchange the skirt for some tight black pants. 

she was bullied for her clothes, height, hair, shyness - but i liked her. as she opened up she was a really sweet, cool girl. 

i started to wonder why sarah never dressed like us since she seemed to love it so much. then i started to notice that *she too* almost wore the same thing everyday. the same khaki pants or acid washed jeans. the same three shirts. same penny loafers. same windbreaker, no makeup or nail polish. the same earrings that were used to pierce her ears. i realized her family must not have much money. my little group got a lot of our things at thrift stores so i invited her to go with us one day after school. she said she couldn't and i said okay maybe some other time and she said yea maybe ... pretty unconvincingly. when i walked back over to my friends they had a lot of rude things say about her. i was a teenage girl ... so i am pretty ashamed to admit that i said ""yea she is pretty weird.""

she loved looking at my brother's picture, handsome in his uniform. she asked me all about him. i think she developed a safe little crush on him. one day she asked who ""bauhaus"" was because the name was artfully scribbled on my pee chee folder. i gave her a mixtape of all my favorite bands and songs and a walkman. she wore those headphones everywhere. bauhaus became her favorite.

i never ever saw her during lunch or any school events or at the mall where basically the entire school went every weekend. she never went to any parties. she always had an excuse when i asked her to do something outside of school. i only ever saw her in our shared classes or the halls with those headphones on. so sophomore year when she asked me to her birthday sleepover i was shocked but let her know that of course i would be there. i finally learned why she was ""pretty weird"". 

she lived in a very typical split level 80s house. nice car in the driveway. her typical 80s mom answered the door. sarah introduced me to her step dad, a short and plump soft looking man who appeared much older than her mother. she had two half siblings. adorable little spoiled brats. her dad looked me up and down like i was dangerous, but there was something foreign and equally as dangerous in his slight smile.

""you have your ears pierced ... twice."" and then he gave a knowing look to sarah's mom. 

she said to me, ""your parents allowed that?"" 

""yes, mrs. duncan my mom helped me do it."" 

""don't call me that, that is *her dads* name"" 

""oh i'm so ..."" 

her step dad cut me off.""you did them yourself?"" before i could answer he stepped forward and slipped his hands in my jacket looking at my t-shirt, ""what does your shirt say?"" 

""the cure uh mr....""

""randall"" 

""the cure, mr. randall, its a band"" 

""hmmm, we don't listen to that nonsense music here."" 

i realized then that to sarah's parents i *was* dangerous. i was a typical 80's teenager. 

sarah's birthday party was just her family and myself. which included her mentally disabled aunt that sarah shared a room with. her aunt rocked and stared and made a low moaning sound until she would point and grunt at something she wanted. later that evening she pointed at a button on my jacket that was hanging on a chair, sarah's mom removed it and handed it to her and never said a word to me.

during dinner her little siblings treated sarah horribly. her parents treated her like she wasn't there. i did my best to be polite, talk to sarah and wonder if i could get out of sleeping over. i wish i had. i was expected to share a queen size canopy bed with sarah and her aunt. 

during the night i got up, grabbed my makeup bag, my clothes and sarah's hand. we went downstairs to a bathroom and she was both giddy and terrified when i started putting makeup on her. she began asking me all the questions. had i ever kissed a boy? how far had i gone? what did my bedroom look like? could i use my car outside of school? what was my mom like? on and on. i had never heard her talk so much.

i answered all her questions, dressed her head to toe and then turned her towards the mirror. she actually gasped. i think for a moment she didn't believe she was seeing herself. i told her again how pretty her hair was and how i wished i had red hair like hers. i said ""you must look like your dad"" since she looked nothing like her family. she teared up and said that she didn't know she had never seen him. i didn't know what to say with my foot in my mouth and all but then the dam broke.

she told me how her mother hated her and would always tell her she was just like her father. how her siblings got everything and she had to beg for anything. how when she got home from school she had to sit at the dining room table so they could keep an eye on her until bed time. she was never ever allowed to go anywhere without a parent. sarah was born when her mother was 15 and she was being punished for it. i just listened. it was horrible, mentally, physically and emotionally abusive. i hugged sarah for a really long time and she cried like she had never been allowed to cry before.

i told her she could keep my clothes and my makeup bag. she looked like she wanted to say yes but she reluctantly took it all off. we started to sneak back upstairs when her stepdad stopped us. sarah was paralyzed with fear and i was scared too but i tried to play it off. i said ""oh hey mr randall, just heading back up to bed."" i took sarah's hand but he grabbed my other. he then told her to go upstairs. she looked at me for a second then did as she was told. 

he watched her go then pulled me tight to him. he put his hand up my nightgown and cupped my bare breast. he rubbed his hard crotch against my hip. 
he said in my ear ""i can be persuaded to not tell mrs randall about this ... if you pay the sweet tax."" 

i was furious and terrified but i had been raised differently. i looked him right in the eye and with all the false bravado i could muster said, ""my brother is a marine, my uncle is a sheriff and both he and my dad are vietnam vets. so if i were you i wouldn't say a thing to mrs randall."" 

he stared at me for the longest few seconds of my life, he looked a little scared and a little stunned and a little like ""sweet tax"" might be worth it anyway. in the end he smiled and let go. he did a very creepy overly exaggerated courtly bow and waved me upstairs. 

sarah seemed surprised to see me so soon. i asked her if she had ever had to pay the sweet tax before. she started to cry again and kept saying ""i'm sorry, i'm sorry."" i got dressed and got my things. i noticed when i said sweet tax her aunt became agitated, i wondered how many times she had paid it. finally when i heard footsteps pass us and a door open and close i left that house of horrors. 

when i got home i woke my parents and told them, it took everything my mom had to convince my dad not to go back there with a shotgun. part of me wanted him to. my uncle was called and he came over right away. he agreed with my mom, that this could all go very badly for sarah. he said it would be ""he said, she said"" and even though i am his niece sarah would have to admit to sexual abuse for services to step in. he said he would go and take care of him right now if i wanted him to. i didn't know what that meant and i didn't ask. i just said no.

sarah avoided me at school for weeks and i was glad. finally we came face to face in a bathroom and she made to leave quickly. i grabbed her arm and said ""talk to me"".

she shook her head and said ""i can't.""

i had never been so angry in my life and shouted, ""really? *now* you can't talk to me?""

she lifted up her shirt and there were three curling iron burns, that looked infected on her side. ""no i can't and i can't ever talk to you again."" she looked down biting her lip and pitifully said ""i'm so sorry, i know you wish you had never met me.""

""that isn't true."" 

she smiled, the saddest smile and said ""i wish i had never met me"" and left.

we didn't speak again until the following year. before classes started one of my friends told me she saw *big red bag lady* (her school wide nickname) crying in the bathroom. i found her and her hair had been chopped off. it looked like a raggedy fuzzy orange pyramid. i didn't say a word i just took her hand. she let me lead her to one of my favorite teachers. he was so kind. looking back now as an adult i realize he was a closeted gay man and i wonder what struggles he himself was facing. sarah told us her mother in a fit of rage had cut her hair off. i told sarah that my cousin was a hairdresser and i would take her right now to get it fixed. my teacher said he would cover for us. she refused. she said it would only make it worse and it would grow back. she was hollow, she was frail and she was defeated. after she left i told my teacher about how her step dad had touched me. he looked disgusted and like he wanted to cry. he put his hand on my shoulder and said ""just be her friend. she won't be in that house forever."" and he was right.

seven weeks later, sarah slit her wrists while she was in the bed she shared with her aunt.

people came to our school and we had an assembly. afterwards we all had to talk to someone and prove we weren't suicidal. i couldn't eat or sleep and i was wracked with sadness and guilt.  but i had a good and loving family who got me through it.

i went to sarah's funeral. my brother took leave and he, my dad and uncle went with me. we sat in the back and watched as sarah's mom became a poster child for grieving mothers. she even buckled at the knees and wailed at sarah's casket. she cried out for everyone to hear. 
""her hair, her beautiful hair, we knew she had *the sickness* when she cut off all her beautiful hair.""
my brother had his arm around me so tightly because i was shaking so badly that my arm started to go numb. 

at the graveside her stepfather gave us a flourished hand wave and almost sounded jovial as he said ""salutations"". my uncle had a vice grip on my dad but my brother went up to her stepfather and hugged him while whispering in his ear. i don't know what he said, i never asked, but sarah's step dad looked like he had just seen her ghost.

when it was all mercifully over i saw a man who looked familiar. i walked over to where he was watching from a distance.

""are you sarah's dad?"" 

he looked at me for a moment with tear rimmed haunted eyes ""yes, i am."" 

""you have her hair""

i started to cry as i put my arms around him. he tensed up for a moment, then breathed out and hugged me, so tight, so fatherly. i like to think that for one brief moment he felt he was hugging his own daughter for the first time. i noticed a woman in the car with two boys - both looked just like sarah.


i think about you sarah. i wonder who you would have become. i know you wanted to open a cafe and serve sweets and sandwiches. i wonder if we could have been friends once you were free from that hell. i think of you when i look at my three daughters. who are the very light of my heart. i especially think of you when i look at my oldest who is 15 but still looks 8 years old through my mom goggles. my daughter with her pink hair and her father's eyes. when i tell her that she lights up, because she is the light of his heart too. i think about you when my only son, who i probably spoil too much, rolls his eyes at the fact that his father and i are ""still goth"". 

i think about you whenever i hear bauhaus.

and i am so so sorry. sorry that every adult failed you. sorry that i failed you. sorry that some adults take their own baggage out on their children. sorry that some adults are disgusting and cross boundaries. sorry that you never got that feeling of rushing home to make curfew, sharing one beer between 10 friends, that feeling of first kissing a boy. i am so sorry that i wasn't a better friend for you. 

but it is different now, sarah. teachers step in. people believe. bullies are confronted. different isn't seen as so bad now. 

you are still with me, sarah, and you always will be. ",12
"had an encounter with a police officer as a black man that i thought would end my life. i'm posting this aware of the hate i will receive. i am going to post this and not come back to it, because i just need to get it out. i am not reading your hate comments or comments invalidating this experience i had. 

on monday afternoon, i was working late at my job. i was supposed to be working with a professor in the lab that evening (i'm a medical student). i told my professor that i wouldn't be able to meet with him as promised, but i would make it to the lab after it closes if he thought it okay. he said it was fine and said he would speak to security to let them know i would be in after hours. (note: it is not uncommon to have students working in labs at all hours of the night. i go to an ivy league institution and went to an ivy league for my undergraduate education, too. many of my friends have slept in labs.) 

i go to the lab, the security person working at the front desk says i have been cleared by my professor, but she was on her way out and would let the incoming security guard know i'd be in the lab. i said thanks and went on with my evening. 

about four hours later--it's almost 10 pm at that point--i'm immersed in my assignment, trying to get done, because i need to be in bed before midnight. without warning, the door to the lab opened and a security guard i hadn't seen before (a white man) asked me what i was doing. i looked at my white lab coat, stared at him through my thick goggles, and raised the tongs i had in my right hand. ""i'm working on homework,"" i said. my heart was already at about 110 bpm, and i average about 65 bpm. 

the guard asked if i had permission, and i said yes. i told him the earlier guard said they'd let the new guard know i'm in the office. i gave him my professor's info and a business card. the guard didn't care; he immediately asked if i was a student. i said yes. i reached for my campus id and the guard reached for his taser. i started shaking violently and i thought i was going to throw up. i told him i was going to get my id. he told me to stand up and leave the lab and that he was calling campus safety (basically campus police). 

i didn't want to contaminate my sample (i had been working on it for almost five hours), so i tried to cover it gently, but the security guard walked up and pulled my arm away and everything fell off the table. i didn't make a sound. i just followed him as he called campus safety. 

campus safety arrived as i sat in the lobby and i just knew it would all be resolved. *i'm a nice, soft-spoken black guy. i don't have dreads or muscles or anything like that. i'm average height. they won't shoot me. my hands are in my lap.* all of these thoughts were eradicated when a (white) campus safety officer walked through the door and began speaking to the security guard. it was like i wasn't even there. 

""he said he was given permission to be here,"" the guard said. 

""yeah, probably just a punk trying to cheat or steal something,"" the campus safety guy shot back. 

i went against every black person's safety guidelines when police are present: i spoke up. i advocated for myself. 

i jumped in and said, ""no, my professor said i could be here. you can call him."" the campus safety officer walked over to me and asked me to search and frisk me for any ""stolen property."" i said i didn't feel comfortable. he said i didn't have a choice or i can be detained. i let him. as he was searching me, his hand roaming down and up my shaking legs, he asked me what i was studying. i told him, with precision, what i was studying, where i had done my undergrad, where my parents lived. basically my entire resume. i think i even regurgitated a project i had received global recognition for. 

i just wanted him to see me as a person in case he shot me. 

he finished up and told me to leave the building. i asked if i could go back and get my backpack. we went to the lab, the campus safety officer searched my backpack, then told me to clean up the mess i had made when my materials fell on the floor. i got down on my hands and knees and scrubbed the tile while the guard and the officer watched. they made small talk. apparently the guard had just transitioned to nights. they watched me the whole time. 

when i was done, i left and was told to only be in the lab during business hours. as i left the building, i could see other lights on with students in the windows. each hunched over their homework, concentrating, unaware that i was leaving -- devastated, humiliated, and exposed. 

the next day, i expected my professor to completely fail me for not getting my assignment done on time. when i went to his office, he told me he had received a report from campus safety about me and asked what had happened. i told him what i said here. he began to cry. he's an american muslim. he told me in the report i was caught stealing and vandalizing equipment and that nothing i said to him was reflected in that report. i was shocked. 

he said he knew something was wrong with the report the moment he read it, because he knew i wasn't that type of person. even if i was--even if i had vandalized and stolen something--why go to such extremes to reprimand instead of having a conversation with the student? he told me about his experiences of being bullied and targeted for being muslim. he told me he knew what i was feeling and to take some time off. he gave me a full pass on the assignment and a chance to re-do it. 

i sat in my car and cried. my professor asked if i wanted to file a report and make it known. he told me that since i go to an ivy league, it would easily gain traction in the media. they could pull security footage and see that i was telling the truth. it could be a big deal. i said no. 

i just want to be a student, not an activist or another person that's taking social media by storm via hashtags. 

i sat in my car and cried my eyes out. it's really not fair. i don't want this. i love police officers. i do. i respect them. i could never do their work. but why... god, why am i--and millions of others--treated like this? i have only ever had positive experiences with police up until now. when i see hashtags about police violence, i always say to myself, ""well, at least it's not me."" but now it *is* me. 

the only things i want for myself: i want to get my md, be a doctor, make people better, and just live my life. 

things i don't want for myself: to get shot for being black. 

thank you. 

**edit:** while i didn't read any of your comments intentionally, i did feel immense guilt for not reporting this adequately. i reached out to my faculty person and he actually did report it anyway. it was anonymous, of course, but he is scheduled to meet with the dean of the department and i am invited to that meeting. it's next week. 

but i do want to say one thing: i gave in and read a few comments, and i see a lot of you saying it is my responsibility to report this or else someone could die or it could be worse. yes, it can be. it could be. it *will* be, but don't you see how fucked up that is? that it's still my responsibility to bring this up to the very people that don't give a fuck? don't you see how devastating this is for me? i want to be angry at you all telling me to tell people and speak up. i do, but i know you're only telling me because it's what's best. in this situation, i don't get a choice and i'm recognizing that now. i think my choices were taken from me when i was born black. 

this is so frustrating and horrifying. 

another clarification: i wrote in this post that i'm non-threatening and that i don't have dreads or muscles. in no way did i mean those as bad or ugly things to have while being black; on the contrary, i think all black is beautiful. but not everyone thinks that, and i just wanted to add it for sake of showing how absurd it all is. 

to all of my black friends who have read this: thank you for surviving this far, even if you don't experience or racism or bigotry on the levels that others do. your courage to still be black and alive is inspiring to me, and i have to do something. ",12
"my healthy adult cat died from anesthesia today. supposedly there's only a 1 / 100,000 chance for that to happen.

it was just a routine dental cleaning. you don't even necessarily have to put them to sleep to clean their teeth to clean them, but it's usually done anyway because otherwise the cats will struggle.

he had to fast beforehand. we didn't give him his usual breakfast and he kept crying to us, wondering why we weren't feeding him like normal.

we had to shove him into a pet kennel to take him to the vet. he hasn't been there many times before, so he still wasn't used to it and was really stressed out. i told him it would be okay, but it wasn't.

he didn't even make it to the actual dental cleaning. he had a really bad reaction to the anesthesia and had to go on life support almost immediately. after several seizures and a heart attack, his lungs had filled up with fluid and we had to put him down.

it wasn't supposed to be like this.",12
"to all the people blaming the friends of the girl who was murdered by who she thought was her uber driver last week..... for those unaware, a senior at the university of south carolina got into the wrong car last week thinking it was her uber. her body was found a couple days after by two hunters. her murderer was also arrested the same day.

i keep seeing people on social media saying it's her friends faults for leaving her at a bar alone. fuck you all. how ignorant do you have to be to go after her fucking friends like that? sure it always helps to travel in twos but for fucks sake... that does not make the fact that she was murdered her friends fucking faults bc they weren't w her. 

i attended usc my freshman year of college. 5 points is the big bar neighborhood. i was always fucking around by myself. i would uber by myself to work, by myself home from the bars, by myself to a boys house after i had been out drinking all night, by myself to parties or friends houses. obviously columbia, sc is not one of the safest places, but you can't always rely on your friends to do everything w you. 

maybe if people weren't so goddam shitty then people would be able to do things like uber or walk places by themselves and not have to worry ab getting raped or murdered. 

i've lost four close friends since i was a sophomore in high school. i'm 21. four fucking friends. the guilt i felt after their deaths of ""i could've done this or that or been here or there and they wouldn't be where they are now"" is fucking real and that feeling fucking hurts without shitty people telling me it was my fault. 

i hope to god none of the people who are incorrectly placing the blame on her friends ever have to experience that pain bc holy shit it hurts. at the end of the fucking day it is nobodies fault except the person who committed the crime.

"my boyfriend tells me he loves me in his sleep every night.. the title says it all really. we've been together for 7 months and already a month in he started telling me he loves me in his sleep almost every time he stays over, which is basically every night. he'll just murmur it in between snores and continue sleeping. he has absolutely no recollection of it the next morning. in addition, whenever i hug or kiss him while he's sleeping he'll smile like a kid and snuggle closer. last night, he broke his own record and said ""i love you"" five times while sleeping. i'm the happiest i ever thought i'd be.

edit: it's the sweetest thing in the world to me that this resonated with so many people. to those of you that already have this, i wish you all the best. to those that wish they had it, i guarantee you, with the right person, it will happen. i will try to reply to everyone. some were assuming he hadn't said that while conscious yet, and i can happily say you're wrong. he says it so much i feel like it'd be impossible to keep count even daily, and even more importantly he shows it every day. again, thanks to everyone. i wish this upon all of you.",12
