"eating cereal with water is better than with milk. i am a true believer that cereal with water is better. the taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. while still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. my friends crucified me when i told them this...so for this reason i am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

edit: i pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below. edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave.. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman.. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

eta: the ""single"" in ""single parent"" refers to the number of parents in the child's life. not the marital or dating status of the individual.",6
"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"kids under the age of 12 shouldn't have access to the internet.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

from an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6
"can i just say, we don't live in a world where everyone gets offended all the time. we live in a world where the very small minority are given a voice by the media because reporting that ""no one got offended"" isn't news. the best thing we could possibly do is just ignore them.. there's this constant thing at the minute where we talk about how ""everyone gets offended all the time"" and the reality is it just isn't true.

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6
"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

‚Ä¢	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did‚Äîdespite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

‚Ä¢	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

‚Ä¢	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

‚Ä¢	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

‚Ä¢	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 ‚Äì 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 ‚Äì higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"if your first language is english, you have no excuse for not being able to distinguish between ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're"".. the same goes for ""your"" vs. ""you're"" (and also ""two"", ""too"", and ""to""). these words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy. 

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6

"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant.¬†every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ‚ô™siiilver and gooold‚ô™!!",6

i'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). expanding on what i said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. it's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",6
"preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money. every fucking time i buy a frozen pizza, i put that sassy bitch in right when i start the oven. why? because i've figured it out. that's right uncle sam, i'm onto you. 

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

so nice try, mr. president. i know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. maybe it isn't significant if one person cooks their frozen italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you're a thinker. you're looking at the grand  scheme of things. millions of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? that's straight theft, my man. and i ain't giving in to that scheme .",6

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

edit - added sources for the statistics i used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. i appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, i think it's a good debate. but even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. have a nice day!

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

 it bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as ""good"" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in ""reserves"" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land?

"taylor swift has a victim mentality. she is not a role model, she is a ""mean girl"" bully in disguise and everyone is falling for it.. **update** on the situation if you care. this(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467%3famp) article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because taylor fans were sending death threats. the article also quotes a label exec saying: 

> taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the amas. big machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn't have the right to block her. labels can't block any artists from performing any songs live.

so take it however you will. lots of cool and differing opinions in here and i've enjoyed reading them. thanks for participating you guys üíï

(**original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the recent news(https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

taylor swift is always playing the victim. almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

example. she put joe jonas(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mneki) on blast over their breakup. told everyone on ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. but joe jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

nope. i'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. they end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. examples:  john mayer, calvin harris, harry styles, jake gyllenhaal.

look at her feuds with other celebrities. kanye and katy perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: rihanna, miley cyrus, tina fey, amy poehler, the list goes on.

look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. she has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

and didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? didn't it come out that taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? it seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. she is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

it definitely could be true. and i do feel bad for her if that's the case.

but she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. worth half a billion dollars. she could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. but she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). i get that people think this is an important message to spread. but the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

taylor swift reminds me of a high schooler. her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their regina george. she has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. nah taylor, you're the problem. the common factor in all these situations is you.

1) stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems. 

he's under no obligation to be your friend just like you're under no obligation to date him. this also applies to men who friendzone their female friends.",6
"children don't owe their parents anything for being raised by them.. a lot of people i've talked to think, that they are owed by their children for raising them. most folks don't even raise their children well, yet they expect the children to pay them back for all the trouble they had with them(?!). for pity's sake it was your choice to have children! if you consider that choice as an investment into your future, just don't have children because you are obviously a trashbag of a person for thinking that way. and even if the child was an ""accident"", it's not their goddamn mistake, it's yours! there is a ton of things you can do to prevent it. even an abortion is a 100 times better solution than raising someone just to make them feel miserable.",6
"if tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.. tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. i can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. i have friends who have been fat fished. that's essentially the same damn thing. why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. it's so fucking dumb to me. a girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""you go girl!"", ""girl power!"", blah blah blah. a guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""asshole!"", ""so misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. it annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200b;

let me be clear, **i have no issue with a woman if she is fat. i am just not attracted to it. also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because i'm 5'9""** 

&#x200b;

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"if someone tells you ""i'll pray for you"" with sincerity, and you respond with a rude comment about religion, you're an asshole.. while i'm not sure just how unpopular this opinion is, i'm putting it in this sub because i've seen it happen so many times recently.

don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for ""helping"" and so they pull the ""i'll pray"" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

but that is why i added ""with sincerity."" if they can't help, if there's nothing they can do, all they can do is appeal to the highest power they know. if you don't believe in their god, or a god at all, that's totally fine. but don't be fucking rude about it.",6
"vanilla coke is the best flavor, even better than the regular flavor of coke.. to begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular coke? sugar? it's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. all you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

with the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. like, really well.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).  

the only real downfall to vanilla coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla coke is.

"whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.. https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

#edit 2: omg thanks for the gold guys, i really appreciate it! omg i also got gilding! thank you stranger. i am so blessed. i love you!

edit 3: google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". i dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. claiming i'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually worse because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

for anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>i live in aus and about 11 years ago i used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with america, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the us for one summer. she went over there an had an inappropriate 'romance' with a camp attendee. he was 15 and she was 20. the boys parents found out and had her charged. she went to a women's prison in iowa. her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the us to try and get her sent back home. she is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. she is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. she is banned from ever travelling to the us. imo she got what she deserved.

"saying 'teach boys not to rape' is just as bad as 'teach blacks not to steal', or 'teach muslims not to bomb'.. i don't understand why people think it is appropriate to aim anti-rape media and slogans at boys or men. especially at university campuses and colleges where it is very common to separate the boys and the girls at the start of the year for workshops against sexual assault, imagine if they separated the whites and the blacks and taught the whites how to avoid being robbed and taught the blacks the definition of theft. or if they gave all the non muslims a 'bomb whistle' to blow when they think they are about to be bombed. none of this is considered ok but still we see rape as a women's issue, rape is a societal issue regardless of who the direct victims are. nobody wants rape, and yet we treat men like they are rapists by default unless taught otherwise.",6

"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly. 

tldr: alcohol will basically negativity effect every aspect of your life if you drink regularly.",6
"i'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be.. people on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.


edit: thank you for the gold and silver!  wow. this blew up... i just wanna add something to this. i'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. one of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. i agree. i'm saying that when i'm intrigued by a post sometimes i really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. but a lot of the time all i see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. sometimes i really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed¬†by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly¬†1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child¬†being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6

"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6
"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6

"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace.. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

"if your are ""literally shaking"" from the recent national tragedies, but you have no direct affiliation with the victims, you need to get over yourself.. i have seen a few overly dramatic people on twitter and reddit going on about how they are ""literally shaking"" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

while those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. if it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

"funko pops are ugly as hell, obscenely mass-produced, and their immense popularity is just baffling. whenever i go to any video game store, or any comic convention, one thing i always know i'm going to see are the endless walls of funko pops. what do people find so appealing about them? not only have they reused the same basic design literally over 100,000 times, they're all universally hideous. big black dots for eyes (even when it doesn't make sense on the character), rectangular head, rounded features, little facial detail, not to mention the huge heads that use more material than their entire bodies. one that sticks out in my mind is the spongebob funko pop, which i'm pretty sure is the ugliest licensed figure i've ever seen in my life.

i've been to peoples' houses and seen shelves covered in funko pops, rarely ever taken out of the box. all i can think is, ""why""? why do people spend all this money on this stuff just to stick it on a shelf and never open it? is it for the investment, like beanie babies were? if so, i can't wait for the bubble to burst so they can all go to the clearance bins and stop wasting so much floor space. they're a perfect example of how you can get people to give you boatloads of cash for worthless crap if you market that worthless crap hard enough.",6

"swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.. when you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. the way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. i personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. they (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet.

"people on amitheasshole need to get a fucking grip.. just read a post there where a woman got three men fired from their jobs because she reported to hr the conversation she eavesdropped on in a bar. the men were discussing about who they find to be the best looking women in the office. in her defence she said she did not expect them to get fired but these fucking most upvoted answers man...  

""nta they got themselves fired!!""  

""nta they deserve it, bastards!!""  

are they fucking serious? i guarantee you that 90% of office workers have at one point discussed what people they work with they find  the most attractive and for them to lose their livelihoods over a drunken discussion that the women was not involved in nor did they realise she was intrusively listening is abominable. the lynch mob mentality on that subreddit and this website as a whole is a disgrace and that devalues the actual victims of workplace bigotry.

"the videos of students giving their poorer classmates' shoes isn't an act of goodwill but rather a disrespectful act of self promotion.. i grew up on welfare as a kid and it was one of the most shameful aspects of my life.

if someone came up to me in front of all my classmates holding a camera and ""gifting"" me a pair of shoes i'd be mortified. blasting my poverty across the entire school, then posting it on the internet, all to garner the praise of their peers and internet strangers  should be discouraged.

i get it, people like feel good stories, but this ain't it people. they're doing it to gain clout and be seen as such a great person by sacrificing a classmate who's already in a tough situation. if you're really trying to make a positive impact on someone in that situation, help them in private - at least spare their pride.",6
"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men. it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

\- so, let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. they were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive‚Ä¶

"my faith in humanity isn't restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case.. you see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""there are still good people in this world. she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. when these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? who gets the interviews and good press? why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""look what we did! we are so nice! we are so good hearted!"" it's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. it's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because i've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. it was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. if you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90¬∞, not 45¬∞, not even 1¬∞.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant.

"instagram is ruining everything (a rant). i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6
"donating organs after death should be the standard, not even mandatory literally normal procedure. just like refusing to call an ambulance when someone is in need is a crime, refusing to give organs because your family members want your body to keep them should be a crime as well

there's people dying from lack of organs and saying ""no i want my son to not donate"" is walking in the hospital room with the dying guy and his family and saying ""no i'd rather let you fucking die ape""

my sister's father died 'cause the parents of his only potential heart donor were religious and said ""nope you can't go to heaven without all your organs so yea he can die i want to go to heaven duh"", how much i hope their cause of death implies losing an organ and be conscious long enough to realize they're not going to heaven

"fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick. i'm so sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/haes movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. i'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but i'm well inside the 'normal' bmi range (bmi of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. i work out, i eat healthy, i have learned to control my urges and i take pride in taking care of my body. it irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  because of this, i find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me i'm curvy or thick. ffs, you're fat! if you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. rant over. 

edit: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why i care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. fat is fat. not curvy, just fat. there are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on youtube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). i simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. but hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",6
people who drive 15-20 mph under speed limit and brake check anyone they think is too close are more dangerous than speeders and tailgaters and should be punished more.. there's nothing worse than driving 40 mph on the interstate/highway or someone brake checking the car in front of me. people who do this tend to be unpredictable and disrupt traffics in other ways such as late merge or not paying attention in duel turn lanes. whereas people speeding or tailgating just want to go faster rather than because they are oblivious to their surroundings.,6
"it's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.. seriously. like i get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. it's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you ‚Äî you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

i'm just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren't people yet, like they're less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. it's so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


edit: okay i need to clarify some stuff. i'm usually just a lurker on reddit, i'm not used to all this attention and i'm not completely sure how to deal with it.

i think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people's throat are down right awful. people have every right in the world to not want kids and as i've mentioned in the comments, i totally get why so many people hate kids. you're allowed to hate them! they can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. in this post i was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. i'm not trying to insult anyone's lifestyle.

also, i deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and i realized i wholeheartedly agree haha. sorry about that! like i said, i'm not used to my posts getting attention.

"acne can actually make a person more attractive.. i have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. however, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? i'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. to clarify, i am not talking about severe cystic acne. painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. but people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. this kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. i can't really put my finger on it. it would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. and even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. some of them i read and think, ""i could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.""

i elected for the bed.

however i wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so i didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. to this day i still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

my opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",6

i was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. i understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/nottheonion, r/tifu, r/eli5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

there aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. the admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda.

"""you can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea..  let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have. but there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. i hate this for several reasons.

1. the people who say this almost never have it worse. they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. i have a disability that limits my ability to walk. i don't complain about it much but i've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. i'm aware of that, but i've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. by the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. complaining solves problems. now, i can't speak for everyone with a disability, but i personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. in fact, i'm probably the best person you can complain to. i've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, i might be able to help. 

4. also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. so even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. look it up.

5. those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if i do it right. after all, isn't that what protesting is? complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. it's used to silence people who need help. i don't think i need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. it's human nature to complain. it just is.

"we need to let some pet breeds die out.. we have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

of course i don't mean all breeds of animals when i say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds i do mean:

french bulldogs, pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: these dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

munchkin cats: munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. if they had no health risks, i still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. but, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (hollowed chest), and lordosis (curved spine).

this isn't even hard to achieve. simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

but i doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

"the problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.. negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

this happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

this is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

i would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

"if you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide. it's the same concept imo. for women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. i think the same concept should apply to suicide. if someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. it's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

edit: 

a lot of people are agreeing and saying ""i agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" my entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

"people aren't homophobic. you're just weird.. i'm a gay guy. i've got a beard, a build, and i dress like most humans do. i don't lisp when i talk, and i don't spend my time gossiping about other people in a weird jersey girl accent (which would sound annoying enough on a woman). i don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. people know i'm gay, and you know how much homophobia i've experienced in my life? zero. not even from ultra conservative people.

i talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. no one bats an eye. i don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. no one feels weirded out in my presence.

much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. it's not even really a fear. more of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

it's ok to be weird. it's ok to be offensive. it's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. because you are odd. and your oddities have dick all to do with the fact that you like dick, and no one is responding inappropriately because you like dick.

"assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist. basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
but:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

if after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

a much needed edit:
- the time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way

"marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.. you've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the u.s. end in divorce. you've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
this is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. the reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of disney fairytale. what a joke. but this is really ingrained in our culture. think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&#x200b;

the fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. they take commitment. they take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

what does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*it means... not scrolling through the facebook or ig pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if i was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*it means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""she/he was mean to me."" ""i deserve this."" ""she doesnt love me anyway. i can sleep with someone else now."" - nope. you made a commitment. stick by it and work on your issues.

\*it means... putting down the video games, the tv controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*it means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200b;

"john lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.. he was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  lennon resented his son julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. after lennon divorced his wife, he took off with yoko ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. julian has stated that paul mccartney was far more of a father to him than john ever was. 

john was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. he often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. he claimed to have met yoko ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

john claimed to have lost interest in the beatles due to paul mccartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. together, he and yoko  destroyed the beatles, then he blamed the breakup on paul mccartney. 

he was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the black panthers.

he was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
his song writing was no better;  the lyrics to strawberry fields forever and come together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as i say, not as i do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. all you have to do is look at his songs. lennon, who sang imagine no possessions lived a millionaire's life in a posh new york hotel.  lennon sang imagine no religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and new age fad that came along, including hindu meditation, the i-ching, and astrology of all kinds.  and it was lennon who sang all you need is love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. and it was lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

"if businesses only have to pay taxes on profit, not revenue. then i should only have to pay taxes after i've paid all my bills and rent.. businesses do not pay taxes on their gross revenue, they get to go to the irs and say, ""well this is what we paid paid our vendors, paid our staff and our bills, so we dont pay tax on this"". great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

regular joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. they are not optional, without those i cannot earn the money to make the salary i am paid.

edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. i'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. feel free to tell me i'm an idiot, but i swear to god this worked for me. you know what pulled me out of my slump? realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. if i was going to get out of it, i was going to have to be the one to make changes. at face value it sounds silly, but i really internalized this idea. i forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. it made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help i don't know what did. realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, i was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. i took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. it wasn't easy, but i spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. this idea may be a crock of shit, but i gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them i thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. i actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" etc. was more helpful. if you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. they don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" if you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

"i'm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ""woke"" poc and lgbtq+ communities. i'm a pansexual black/cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. throughout these 5 years i've seen so many people who swore they were ""woke"" proceed to do a poem that isn't much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. at the end of these poems, most poc go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they've done nothing but try to be an ally. 

this kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  a person of color can post anything about white people. they can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ""i hate white people"" and be fine. same thing with queer people and straight people. 

and i get it. i'm black, cuban, queer, and a woman. i'm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. my gender has been put down for centuries. i would've had to force myself into the closet if i was born a couple of centuries earlier. i know what it's like to be hated for who i am. i know what it's like to feel angry for what's been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. but i don't compliment these poems. i don't applaud. i don't like these posts. because it's wrong. this is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. this is all just tit for tat. 

you're not woke if you:

- make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can't take it back in your direction. 

-use generalizations like ""all white people"" or ""all straight people"" but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ""all black people"" or ""all queer people. 

-refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they're a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn't want to interact with you because you're a queer person of color. 

-push allies away when they're trying to help you. 

-think you're better than anyone because of your identity. 

everyone has the right to be who they want. to be proud of their identity. you have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn't be hated and put down for it. but you shouldn't put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

next time you write a status or a poem about the ""other"" side, insert blanks on every time you name them. insert something represents you into the blanks. then read the poem and visualize someone from the ""other"" side reading it back to you. do you feel put down? that's what you're doing to others.

2) i'm in the uk, this was not a matinee showing. even if it was, i refuse to believe that it is ok to bring your young child to a movie they cannot understand, follow, sit still or be quiet for. some people work shifts, or evenings and weekends, and cannot see it at 11pm. other people have paid their damn money and you, by bringing your children for' family time's just because you want to see the movie, are ruining it for others. get a damn babysitter.


3) some might say this is a popular opinion. i'll tweak it: i should be allowed to slap people who bring children that talk / make a disturbance in the cinema. 

i made this post on the basis that it was unpopular, due to the sheer number of people who still do it. they seem to think it is ok. so yeah that's where i'm coming from.",6
"reddit became a place for pathetic people patting each other's shoulder how enlightened they are. i love reddit for the creative output you see in some subs and for the interesting things you can learn or see. 

but those popular subs like /r/instagramreality, /r/trashy and so on, it's all about people trying to be better than others and patting themselves on their own shoulders how much more they understand what's going on and how they know, what's wrong and what's right. 

it's even worse in the comment sections, since those became a contest on how funny one can be, not matter how serious the topic may be. 

and don't get me even started on inhumane subs like /r/wcgw, where they celebrate, people getting hurt.",6
"a 'dislike' button on facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better. the title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but i do believe this to be true. the absence of a dislike button on facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and i believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


the only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an angry emoji or comment. the angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? you might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. this sends out the wrong message. this tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


it would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, i think it is important.  


yes i know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. it influences people, some people live on there. facebook impacts the world.  


tldr; facebook needs a dislike button for the sake of balance and reducing online arguments",6
"tangled was a better movie than frozen.  tangled had a better storyline than frozen. tangled was about escaping a toxic environment and finding one's self. for all rapunzel's life, she was stuck in a tower having one view of life. her mother told her that the world was cruel and unforgiving. while her mother was partially right about the world, (the stabbington brothers were kind of evil) they also were good people. while on her adventure, she learned not to judge based on appearance. she even had a musical number with people that were considered thugs. rapunzel was also an icon. she didn't need eugene but knew when to accept help. she saved eugene and herself many times during the movie with a frying pan. even the song ""i see the light"" was better than let it go. the song is about her finding the light and finding a new perspective with eugene. she admits that she was blind when she was in the tower. let it go is a good song but its not as good as ""i see the light""",6
"making the bed is a pointless chore and a waste of time.. sure, it looks aesthetically pleasing, but the following night you're just going to mess it up again! the only time people should really be expected to make up their bed is when (for some reason) you're having company over that wants to check out your bedroom. and even then i would argue that it's ridiculous that society expects you to straighten the thing that you sleep in every night. 

there's nothing gained from it other than satisfaction, it's stupid.

"your trigger words are not a stranger's responsibility. as respectful human beings, we have a personal decency to cater for any preferences in the room. it's common empathy. but there's a highly uncharismatic sense of entitlement to the one who walks into a house and expects every unmet character to know they're offended by the word ""cheesecake."" while it's unfortunate that ""cheesecake"" makes you feel unsafe, or brings you back to a traumatic past, no one is accountable for knowing that unthey've been told. the whole point of meeting someone, is you explore each other's qualities' and acquire knowledge that makes the next encounter more convenient. so unless you tailor a varsity bomber jacket that says ""cheescake was a dark time"" then you can't berate them for attacking you with the gun they didn't even know they had.

this can apply to more than trigger words. some examples i've witnessed are:
- bf/gf expects you to know why they're mad without context
- punished for breaking a rule that was never provided to you
- called to someone not knowing they had a name change

now, there is a grey line to this. if you believe someone has a ""trigger"" topic, you can choose from the goodness of your own heart to avoid it. that's courtesy, and you're simply a nice person. on the flip side, if you knew deep down they probably wouldn't like it, and brought it up to get a kick out of using ""i didn't know"" as an excuse, then you just suck.

as a concluding statement, no. i do not know anyone who is offended by cheesecake.",6

"(unpopular for cannabis users) i think weed culture is awful.. i use cannabis everyday, i would be considered a ""stoner"" by most people. weed culture is childish, cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug. i would rather kick myself in the balls than own anything with a cannabis leaf drawn on it, wether it's shirt, a hat, an ashtray, a rolling tray, a poster a tattoo, a bong or a fucking sticker. people whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on youtube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos.

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. they turned bob marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 every dealer i have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. i know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.

"the real ""alpha"" males tend to be respectful and chill people. it's the guys with insecurities and problems trying to be ""alpha"" who are assholes.. growing up, i was in a position where i was always going through some sort of adversity whether it be family, school, illness, ect. and there were days where i wasn't putting my 100% game face and attitufe outside the house. 

i notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. for example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in hs and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. i've had lab mates who went to oxford and harvard who i wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. you know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

i had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. for example one example of a former close i had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. after, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. his ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. he did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. he always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. people initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he's just a total loser. in the neighborhood i grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy i described above.

"accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty.. with the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. as the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. however with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. this can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable.

"""my body my choice"" isn't a good argument against pro-life people. gonna start this off by immediately saying i am pro choice, and not going to get into debates about that here. i just want to say people who keep repeating the lines ""it is my body"" and ""it is my choice"" aren't going to sway any pro-life people to come to your side.

pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. so repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

"people with tourette's, autism, and other conditions that prevent them from being quiet during a movie should not be allowed in movie theaters with a general audience.. i was watching a movie with my friend this weekend. it was a fairly crowded theater. someone with either tourette's or austism spectrum or some sort emotional lability came in with his friend/family/companion/guardian. during the movie, the guy with the condition  kept jumping up, stomping, shouting, or screaming during the film, especially during shocking moments. this pretty much ruined the experience for everyone else.

i am sure this person has a very tough life. but whoever escorted him should have thought about the other movie goers and opted to enjoy a movie in a private space.

""everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""looks don't even matter. what's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""you're perfect just the way you are."" 


these quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. it's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. god forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

but... why? is being unattractive that bad? is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? are the lies necessary?

sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. but alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. some people are born with attractive features; some are not. some are born with blatantly unattractive features. yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. for men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. for women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. aside from certain fetishists, i've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites.

i understand that (at least in the states) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. for the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


and on taking kids away from parents i agree there should be some steps before that happens. there should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. but if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

"all of these ""all female cast"" reboots are insulting to woman and not helping.. reboots are almost always atrocious. even a magnificent actress can be made to look bad by poor writing and directing.

these all woman cast remakes are *not* helping women. the movies are objectively bad. instead of rebooting something with an all female cast, why not actually write good roles for the many fabulousness female actors. 

its absolutely insulting to woman because it implies that people will only watch it if it's a female version of a formerly predominantly male cast movie.

i would much rather watch a orginal film with an all female cast than some poorly written reboot.

this is unpopular because if you say that these movies are bad, you're called a misogynist.

"small breasts are infinitely better than huge fake breasts.. fake breasts look like they're...fake. they rarely look good. even the best jobs still look bad. most look like half volleyballs taped to the chest. they they maintain their shape when the woman lays on her back. they only look semi convincing when the woman is fully clothed. every time i see them in a porn it's a turn off too. bottom line, ladies, natural breasts, no matter their size and shape, are better and much sexier.

"judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.. so here's the thing: looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. for example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. if you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

sending food to countries that can't feed themselves only makes the problem worse. the root of the problem is these people can't feed themselves. feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can't be fed. either teach these people to farm or let them starve. if they aren't capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

parts of africa are like the crazy cat lady. she sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. what started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. she hasn't solved a problem she just made it worse. she had good intentions but didn't stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

"if your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.. for the record, i'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

what i am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. she had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200b;

there are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200b;

the first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. he is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. i know, crazy right?

&#x200b;

the second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. you are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200b;

now, reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200b;

1. no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. i'm not saying that a guy should say ""do this for me, or i'm leaving."" i'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. that relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. if both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then i guess it's a match made in heaven.

this post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

for me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. i dumped her. girls i've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that i was aware of.)

another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

there are more, but they're all pretty much the same story.",6
"toxic femininity is worse than toxic masculinity. in recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. the current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. but during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

when you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. the whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200b;

but when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. a lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. a few examples being;

* blaming behavioural issues on periods
* acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200b;

some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. it's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. some of these examples are major toxic offences. such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

one of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"dear humans: vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". it *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (blame ice cream's history). when you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. and it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". this made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. but it's not.

it really doesn't help that in the u.s., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""american cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) vanilla was once described in europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". that's why it became so common. and over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. it's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that i think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). real vanilla is fantastic.

stop misrepresenting vanilla. it's a great flavor. (although i know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing i can do to fix that. as if ""vanilla minecraft"" is even boring... sigh.)",6

"telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not why we are really afraid.. anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings. resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

the conversation went as such: if you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

yeah. no shit. the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **or** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). so... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

what isn't outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. the implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* in effect, it was a lie by omission. 

and the above really isn't my point anyways. here's the main point:

*in a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. there are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

so, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* where's the deterrent there? 

another question that i have never once seen given a good answer:

how does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? this is how *most* consent occurs anyways. other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: intimacy with a woman. 

we have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

lastly: i want to be wrong. 

here's what you can do if i am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard i've found. 

i'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that i am *nowhere close* to being alone here. relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. you won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on facebook. talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on reddit at least.  

so, if i am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that i am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"the word ""moist"" isn't gross. the circlejerk over it is ridiculous.. there seems to be this meme of the word *moist* being inherently disgusting and creepy, and i don't get it. is ""damp"" really a better word to use? what sounds more appetizing, a *moist* cake or a *damp* cake?

people have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. the punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. its not any different than keying their car. it's cowardly and childish.

you don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. that person could be supporting children or a sick relative. and getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

"schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.. you have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. so many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. i had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and i had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until i cried so i was forced to give up, not to mention that was a huge expense every month some families might not be able to spare. different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. turns out i didn't even have acne. i have a very common condition called kp, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. if you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. i could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. these kids essentially have an addiction. the majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine bmi and extremely healthy. not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

i knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

all in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. i'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? it is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? we often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"healthcare would be more affordable if we didn't spend so much money on keeping very old people alive. i work in a hospital and i see so many obvious hopeless cases in icu. many machines, many tests and round a clock care for geriatric patients with failing organs or crippling diseases , etc. kept alive for weeks at a time, just to die anyways. 

this even goes for ""younger"" patients. the guy with the chronic liver disease or a drug user. in the ""old days"" those patients would've just died before receiving hundreds of thousands in medical care but now with so much advances in technology, people are kept alive much longer artificially than otherwise would've been. but they're not really alive. you're just delaying the inevitable at a great cost and disservice to quality of life.

"we need to stop telling kids they can be whatever they want to be.. hold up, just hear me out. i'm not saying we should destroy the dreams of kids, but i'm absolutely in favor of not over-inflating a child's hopes to the point where they can't cope with any future failure.

we should be realistic with children from a very young age. say things like, ""you can do so much"", ""the future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""you can be literally anything you want to be""

i think it would help kids understand that while they have so much potential, there are some things they can't control.

"the word ""retarded"" shouldn't be offensive. the fact that society is shying away from ""the r-word"" is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. basically, by replacing ""retarded"" with something else, we're just kicking the can down the road and it's a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

not that long ago, the term ""retarded"" was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like ""idiot"" and ""imbecile"" (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

the term ""special"" or ""special needs"" is probably the most common way of replacing ""retarded,"" but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives ""special snowflakes""). 

obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn't necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

"it should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services.. some may claim this isn't unpopular, but i think it is. bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman's body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can't even file a cps report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

if you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. it should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she's growing a developing fetus. 

it should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. at the very least, cps should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

edit: for those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you're pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. this applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. common sense would still be applied by cps.

"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 i think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. my doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. i have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

edit 2: i remembered more of our eating habits as a child. we had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. we also spent a lot of time outside. all in all, education is a huge influencer and effort makes a difference!

"reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.. hear me out.

i originally came here because i heard that reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. that was a lie.

subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

the problem with the rules and independent moderation of reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. it doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

most moderators just want safe spaces. they usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

all of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use reddit are. (being liberal is okay, i'm a moderate, so i don't really care). both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. i've seen conservatives do it too. just not as much. sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

the icing on the cake is that reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. i have faith in time it will die.

censorship will kill reddit.

safe spaces will kill reddit. 

cancerous moderation will kill reddit.

admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill reddit.


edit: by ""moderate"" i'm saying that i'm in the middle, i base my political beliefs on what i think is right, and i don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. both have great and terrible beliefs. i go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. i'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. i'm just clearing that up.",6
"making a public tweet about someone sexually abusing you isn't brave, go to the police.. if you're ""brave"" enough to come forward and accuse someone publicly and have your followers shame them but don't have the balls to file an official police report than chances are you're full of shit.

edit: i wrote this late. my wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. i'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
recently in the voice acting scene a popular va has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow vas are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. they havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
i've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. they're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them.

there are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. that should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

we all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it.

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

\-new jersey is a great state, probably one of the best northern states. stop thinking of ""jersey shore"" because the majority of this state is working class families living in the suburbs, not party freaks and tony soprano wannabes.

\-vegetables go great on hamburgers, i hate when people say that tomatoes/onions/lettuce don't belong on them. they make hamburgers much better.

\-ai is a terribly overrated and bad idea that people only support because they only see the positive side of it.

\-modern sonic games are just as good as the genesis and dreamcast games.

\-modern architecture and home design sucks. i love the aesthetic of ""pre-recession"" houses. today they're all built out of cardboard and are only useful for looking nice.

\-they should have rebuilt the twin towers. the new one looks only ok at most, i love the brutalist architecture designs of the originals.

\-flip phones and slider phones are better than smartphones, and they should make a comeback.",6
"if you break up with someone because of their mental illness(es) you are not a garbage person.. coming from someone who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for a solid 8 years  i recognise the impact is has on my family and friends. 

sometimes i'm a really fucking difficult person to be around. if someone doesn't want to commit to dealing with that, then that's fine. it doesn't make you a bad person, and you shouldn't feel bad about leaving someone for that sole reason. 

it's the same with friendships. if you no longer want to be friends with someone with a mental illness because they drain you. that's ok. your own health and well-being come first over anyone else's.

"men face a more unrealistic standard of beauty than women, they just don't complain about it.. you hear it every day. women complaining about the unrealistic standard of beauty they are faced with. they act like its women and only women. 

well, hello brad pitt, ryan reynolds, ryan gosling, chris hemsworth, jason momoa, dwayne johnson, john cena, channing tatum, etc, etc...the list goes on.

the ""standard"" women face is for the most part weight. most overweight people have the ability to exercise and diet to cut their weight, and although theres a rare few who have conditions causing their obesity, most of them are just too lazy and lack the discipline to drop the pounds. plus there's all of those ""love your body"" campaigns trying to make overweight women feel like they're ""good enough"". at least they have makeup as a viable option.

 sure losing weight is hard but let's look at what men are facing.

let's start with height. gotta be 6ft or taller. 5'11 doesnt cut it, and apparently they can tell the difference. i'm kidding, they cant, but if they ask you, and you're 5'10 or 5'11, you better lie because apparently those few inches are a deal breaker. men face the same struggle with weight, *billy may's voice* -- but wait, theres more! do you have any idea how hard it is to get a ripped body like all those male celebs that parade around shirtless in the movies? its really fucking hard. for some people, it's not even possible. it goes beyond weight. female celebs get boob jobs, ass jobs, etc, which any woman can get, but the men have to train for years to get the body you see in movies and magazines. to top it off, we cant wear makeup either. not that we want to, but as a man you have to show every flaw you have, yet they call that plus sized female model who couldn't put down the fork the brave one.

so please, stop acting like women are the only one facing an unrealistic standard. sure men could complain, but complaining about it would make them seem like less of a man, so i guess that's another thing to add to the list.",6
"r/politics should be demonized just as much as r/the_donald was and it's name is misleading and should be changed. r/politics convenes in the same behaviour that td did, brigading, propaganda, harassment, misleading and user abuse. it has no place on the frontpage until reformed.. scroll through the list of articles currently on /r/politics. try posting an article that even slightly provides a difference of opinion on any topic regarding to trump and it will be removed for ""off topic"".  

try commenting anything that doesn't follow the circlejerk and watch as you're instantly downvoted and accused of shilling/trolling/spreading propaganda.  

i'm not talking posts or comments that are ""maga"", i'm talking about opinions that differ slightly from the narrative. anything that offers a slightly different viewpoint or may point blame in any way to the circlejerk.  

/r/politics is breeding a new generation of rhetoric. they've normalized calling dissidents and people offering varying opinions off the narrative as  nazi's, white supremacists, white nationalists, dangerous, bots, trolls and the list goes on.  

they've made it clear that they think it's okay to harrass, intimidate and hurt those who disagree with them.

this behaviour is just as dangerous as what /r/the_donald was doing during the election. the brigading, the abuse, the harrassment but for some reason they are still allowed to flood /r/popular and thus the front page with this dangerous rhetoric.  

i want /r/politics to exist, but in it's current form, with it's current moderation and standards, i don't think it has a place on the front page and i think at the very least it should be renamed to something that actually represents it's values and content because at this point having it called /r/politics is in itself misleading and dangerous.  

**edit**: thank you for the gold, platinum and silver. i never thought i'd make the front page let alone from a throwaway account or for a unpopular opinion no less. 

to answer some of the most common questions i'm getting, it's a throwaway account that i made recently to voice some of my more conservative thoughts even though i haven't yet really lol, no i'm not a bot or a shill, i'm sure the admins would have taken this down if i was and judging by the post on /r/the_donald about this they don't seem happy with me either. also not white nor a fascist nor russian. 

it's still my opinion that /r/politics should be at the very least renamed to something more appropriate like /r/leftleaning or /r/leftpolitics or anything that is a more accurate description of the subreddit's content. /r/the_donald is at least explicitly clear with their bias, and i feel it's only appropriate that at a minimum /r/politics should reflect their bias in their name as well if they are going to stay in /r/popular

"getting a babies ears pierced should be illegal.. edit: i'm against circumcision as well, i'm against anything to a baby that isn't medically needed. i'm just having this argument about piercings because i've never seen it discussed. it's the same as tattooing a baby. you're modifying their body without their consent at all. they have no idea what day it is, so how can they tell you yes that they want piercings? 


i've wondered this all my life. 

when i was a kid, i got my ears pierced. i had waited so long and finally after my mom was sure it was what i wanted, she let me get them done. i went to the place and saw a baby screaming as she was getting her ears pierced. her mom was holding her and telling her to quiet down because she was screaming. i remember looking at my mom and asking why she was doing that. my mom sometimes just didn't have an answer and that was a time that she didn't. even then i knew something was wrong with that picture. 

so now i'm older and realize that getting babies ears pierced is really fucked up. the baby can't even say yes or no to wanting their ears pierced. we all throw a fit when someone can't consent to something these days, so really why is this allowed? 

i've met people who had this happen and they didn't like the idea of piercings, but still had the holes in their ears from it. i got mine done years ago and i never wear earrings, but the holes are still there. i don't regret it, but i can't imagine how people feel that they got their ears pierced against their will when they couldn't even understand the meaning behind it. 

anytime i bring this up it's an ""you're overreacting"" or ""it's not your child, why do you care?"" i feel like i'm going insane here, but how is this okay. how is piercing a baby who can't even understand what pierced ears are okay? ",6

then on top of that if a kid commits suicide, then boom if so much as a verbal report was made by someone being bullied and no real punishment was given to said bully then the school should be forced to pay out 51% of their networth to the parents of the kid and have it put down on public record what happened.",6

"if high school was the best years of your life, you have a very sad life.. you hear this sentiment often, especially from folks who were football players, cheerleaders, etc (generally popular groups). i hope they have had actually made a life for themselves after high school, but in my experience (being out of school for 22 years now)...i find the opposite to be true. the former popular kids i run into are just sad looking with dirty kids pulling on their clothes. they look depressed.

while, the ""nerdy"" kids who were basically social outcasts (especially in the 90's) are now successful, and driving nice cars...and generally look pretty damn happy!

"a 24hr rule is needed for every breaking story or viral vid that incites mob anger. i was one of the angry people yesterday w/ the viral clips of the na elder & kids in maga hats, and have done a complete 180 and don't blame the kids at all.. i really wish people followed a 24hr rule and got more information before social media nut jobs go crazy over viral clips. my heart sank and i was immediately pissed off when i saw the viral clips on twitter where kids w/ the maga hats looked like they were harassing an elderly na man. he looked like he could be my lolo albino and i just couldn't imagine myself walking up to someone elderly and choosing to target and harass them. 





i went searching for other video clips and information about the incident where they said that these kids approached the elder, interrupted a ceremony, got in his face and started chanting things like ""build the wall."" i did not find evidence of that, but i did find a whole bunch of other footage and tried to piece everything together. 


i found a statement from one of the kids that a local reporter tweeted out(https://twitter.com/aclementswkrc/status/1086822521012473858) w/ a bunch of video clips he mentions in the statement.

- from a full video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ec1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the black hebrew israelites (bhi), it shows them street preaching to the na group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. some na people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. the group of kids aren't seen until 46:41(https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. 





- the group of kids congregate off to the side seen on 1:05:00(https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting i assume for a bus to pick them up. bhi turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. i do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. more kids meet up with the group; i guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. one street preacher provides commentary on their chants. kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and bhi jokes(?) that they're kneeling to israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the na group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. some people in the na group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. the kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. no one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. and while i might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the na chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). these kids did not approach the na group, interrupting their ceremony. the rest of the video is bhi talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them.





- close up of when the na group approached the student group as they were doing another chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnljljuirg8






- another video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npx801xlsfy) the small group of kids confronting bhi starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the na group. a couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the na group is doing at 1'06""(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=66) and 1'20""(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=82). people on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. but it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. like, i myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. 






- off to the side, a man from the na group is heard talking to another kid at 1:35(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=95), saying ""white people, go back to europe where you came from...this is not your land..."" things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the na elder turns to the other kid at 2:09(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. that, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. the rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the na group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more bhi preaching stuff where they call ""trump a homosexual""/rants about gays/etc(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive.







- after looking at what i think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason.  the viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. it's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. it's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and i'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. so far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. it's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what i thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids.

- street preachers (bhi) was on the second level of the lincoln memorial, saying antagonizing things to an na group that got in a scuffle with them and then left


- maga students meet up a the memorial to wait for a bus.


- the street preachers target the students, spouting slurs at them. students leave and go off to the side to do their school chants while they wait.


- na group approaches the group of kids as they finish their chant and the kids turn to dance with the na group, thinking that they came to them to join them. no one says anything to each other for several minutes except for chanting and drumming. 


- one guy gets into argument w/student; doxxed kid turns to his friend and signals to cut it out and let it go. most of the kids leave to join other kids in front of the street preachers or elsewhere realizing that these pple don't like them.


- bhi spouts homophobic things to the students again and targets a black student who was with the group, calling him names and saying that ""they white people were going to take his organs""(https://twitter.com/ava_quigley/status/1086796421226029056). students leave.

"it's perfectly ok for a man to hit a woman back if she hit him first. the most popular argument against this is that ""*men are stronger*"". yes, but why pick a fight with someone far stronger than you? if i walk into a gym and punched the biggest guy there in the face, should i cry foul if he hits back?

granted, i can't exactly call it self-defense. chances are, a woman hitting a man isn't exactly a threat to his life. but it doesn't have to be. she is trying to cause him pain. he should have the right to cause her pain in return. i'm not saying he should go ape-shit on her and send her into a coma, but at the same time he should have the right hit her with the intention of causing her pain.

far too often i see women hitting men *knowing* they won't hit back. this expectation that men won't hit back encourages women like this to be aggressive. men don't pick fights with bigger men because they have a rational fear of the bigger guy hitting back. too often, women use this expectation of chivalry as armor.",6

"if being a stay-at-home-mom is a full time job then being a working-dad is having 2 jobs. if a relationship is as it's supposed to be then a dad is right there next to the mom changing diapers, doing chores, and losing sleep. if a stay-at-home-mom never has a day off then neither does the dad, he's just switching shifts. 

what do people think happens when the dad gets home? he sits on his ass in front of the tv and drinks a beer?

its a bit annoying that people seem to think the mom does all the work with the child and around the house. that's not how relationships work.

edit: okay, going to clear something up. nowhere did i say what the stay-at-home does is not important. what i did say is that the working spouse still does chores around the house when they get home, they still watch the kid when the get off work, they still contribute to their house because that's what a good partner does. yes the stay-at-home does this all day, at varying levels depending on kid, but to say the dads/working partner don't is ridiculous.",6

"society needs to stop defending gang activity and ""hood life"". i'm not sure how to put this, the title really explains it the best here.  i'm also writing this at 4:46 am so bear with me, i just wanted to put it down into words before i forgot.

i live in new york. i've seen my fair share of hoods.  and i browse social media and listen to tons of music, just to see people defending gang activity and such.

i really don't get it. people know killing and stealing is wrong, yet they glorify these people for their ""struggles"" when they definitely get involved with violent activity. being poor does not give you the right to kill and steal! but people will blindly listen to hiphop and rap because it's ""woke"" and they sympathize with these asshole rappers. it's become cool to break the law because ""fuck the police"", and all police use excessive force, apparently.

people on social media seem to just be so proud of their gang relations, and the crimes they commit, and post about it to their blind audience who likes and retweets everything about it. people listen to hiphop where rappers sing about the atrocities they have and still commit, and people will be like ""yo i fuck with this"" and ""yo this is so woke"".   i fucking hate it.

gangs have become a race thing. if you're against gangs, you're racist, it seems. people have tied gangs to specific races such as latinos and black people. and i think that's why it's normified, both indirectly and directly. i've literally seen movements such as ""protect our hoods"" try and directly stop deslumification. it's so stupid- there is nothing good about breaking the law or being in poverty. but people really think that this is how life is for black and latino people, which really contributes to the racism we have today.

i seriously wish we didn't come to this. a society of violent assholes seems to be on the rise to social acceptance, and it's a huge tumor to everyone. there is absolutely nothing to be proud of here. defending rape, mugging, killing, drug dealing, etc. makes you just as bad as the person committing them. gang are not a good thing, gangs are not your ""family"", gangs are a criminal cesspool.",6
"all bodies are not beautiful, healthy bodies are beautiful.. i'd like to preface this by saying that i do appreciate the spirit behind the statement that all bodies are beautiful. i think it's very cool that people want others to feel accepted and comfortable despite being different than a perceived majority. 

however, all bodies are not beautiful, and we shouldn't pretend they are. people that are overweight to the degree it affects their health are not beautiful, they're unhealthy. they don't deserve to be mistreated for it, but they also shouldn't be constantly validated. 

there is a biological standard for objective physical attraction partially rooted in physical health. we are not attracted to people that won't be healthy mates. we are not attracted to people that look unhealthy. we should stop pretending unhealthy bodies are attractive because they aren't. i hate seeing people validate someone's unhealthy lifestyle because they don't want them to feel bad. it's not a good way to help people, it just makes things worse.

edit 1: reading the comments i saw a few people telling me that i was talking about a skinny body and that i should clarify that. that's not quite true. skinny can also be unhealthy and therefore unattractive, but it is true that i am mostly addressing weight when i talk about a healthy body. 

edit 2: i don't think that amputations or scars make a person not beautiful. if your body is healthy, it's beautiful. it's a very cut-and-dry opinion. if you have scars, had an amputation for medical reasons, or anything like that your body can certainly still be beautiful. i only want my post to address things that are in the control of the person.

edit 3: hopefully my final edit. i'm sorry if i have been unclear. i have a lot of comments about how beauty is subjective, so let me clarify: this post refers to an objective standard of physical attraction that is held by having a healthy body and lost by having an unhealthy body. i understand attraction can have a subjective element, that's not where my opinion is based though!",6
"men respect women more than women respect men. i know this sounds contrary to everything you've heard, but hear me out. from guys, i hear plenty of stupid comments. ""women are crazy"" ""women are too emotional"" ""women overreact to everything"". it's either making dumb jokes from their buddies or wondering why their girlfriend/wife is angry with them. 

but i've only heard genuine loathing from women. ""men are all the same"" ""men are trash"" they're monsters, creeps, and on and on. and it isn't just certain men. i've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. i've never heard any man say they hate all women, but i've heard women say they hate all men. 

lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. when men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. if a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. this is a generality of course and i can only speak from my own experience. 

then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women. but very rarely have i seen it in reverse. i've encountered it maybe twice in my life. many messages talking about how we need to respect women; very little about respecting men.

"farmers are by far the most important job in existence, yet they go under-appreciated, are denounced as 'ruffians' and intellectually challenged by the rest of society.. the typical perception of a 'farmer' is missing half his teeth, speaking in an accent that only the local town will understand, calling everyone a 'city' boy or lad, avoiding school because of 'hard work' and so forth.

i have vastly more respect for single parents that don't use being a single parent as a crutch or a method for attention grabbing. 

edit: some of my replies to comments are getting buried, so i'll clarify a few things:

1. obviously i'm not talking about widows, etc. i'm talking about those women that made poor life choices and then attempt to virtue signal, especially on social media.

2. poor life choices include not using at least two methods of birth control during sex. if birth control is not your priority, you should not be having sex. 

3. if you do create a child, it is your duty to raise them, whether alone or with someone else. you don't deserve a medal for it.

"who cares who chick-fil-a supports? you're going for the chicken, not their values.. chick-fil-a's owner has stated before he believes man is made for woman and vice versa. recently i've seen reddit getting pretty upset and talking about boycotting chick-fil-a for being bigots and homophobic and whatnot.

who cares? there are a lot of companies with a lot of bad values behind them, or have been built on immoral practices, and they don't generate a lot of hate. nike is built on child labor and there was more hate on them when they hired a guy who knelt during football games. nestle is just... awful, and we don't talk about boycotting their products.

1.) they taste better:
the skin adds a chewy aspect to it rather then it being just a slurry you swallow, you actually chew the food...crazy

2.). it wayyy easier:  
no need for a fuck ass peeler, don't have to clean it, plus they're kinda scary.  all you need to do for the potatoes is scrub them under some warm water, what a bother.

"no one should feel bad for catching a ball at a baseball game and not giving it to a nearby child.. i'm even okay with wrestling it away so long as no one is hurt. (**edit: this refers to a simultaneous possession/catch scenario where the kid and i both have our hands on the ball at the same time. i am not okay with an adult running over to a kid who already caught it and snatching it away. but if the kid competes with me to catch it, i'm winning that competition and not feeling the least bit bad about it.**)imagine if you're a baseball fan who's been going to games their whole life and you don't get a chance to catch a ball until you're like 34 or something. you catch one and someone's little kid is nearby and they're either crying or giving you that oliver twist ""may i have some more?"" look.

if you want to give the kid the ball, great. if you don't and you keep it, also great. i mean, think of who has more invested, here. the adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of mlb for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

but of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don't give the kid the ball. as a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. it'll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. so let's weigh pros and cons.

if you give the ball away, people will say you're a swell person online, but you'll be upset because you don't have the ball. 

if you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they'll forget and you still have the ball. kid will forget by next week. 

the winning option is clear. i'm not even a huge baseball fan but if i should so happen to be at a cardinal's game one day and i catch a ball, i am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it's my own kid.

**edit2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. it sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. the baseball would do the same thing. but also, if i wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that's my prerogative. the happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. i also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. one kid i know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the mlb. i can also see myself giving it to him. the point is, though, that what i do with it could be anything i want. it's mine.**

"bullies who pick on kids to the point of suicide should be shown the body of their victim.. as long as there's solid evidence that they're guilty of harrassing/bullying/torturing the deceased (there should be a thorough investigation first) i feel like they should suffer like the family of their victims and the victims themselves. if they're that hateful that they drive someone to take thier own life then they should bare witness to the consequences of their actions, i don't feel like it's enough to just tell them, show them. obviously with the permission of the family. 


i also feel like they should answer to the family of the person they bullied, really get a feel for what they have done. it will probably scar them for life, good, the pain the family will be in for the rest of their lives is incomparable so the guilty party should feel at least a percentage of that. 


it may seem harsh but i just read a story about a young boy who layed in front of a train and killed himself due to being bullied. he was 14. he killed himself in front of 40/50 other students including his friends who will also be scarred for life. all because some vicious little pricks harrassed him until he no longer saw a light at the end of the tunnel. and what will the guilty get? slap on the wrist? expulsion? ridiculous. teach them a lesson, make them look at what they've done and give them the opportunity to apologise face to face to the families who have been broken by the sadistic actions of these nasty, spiteful kids. i'm talking high school and up because that's generally where it gets bad, although this is starting to creep into primary schools too which is horrifying.


if i thought for one second that any kind of preventative measure would work then i'd suggest that instead. but years of unrelenting abuse and families losing their kids to suicide has lead me to believe that there is no tactic of prevention that would actually work worldwide. that hurts my heart. people are so cruel. i don't want to send my baby to school, i'm terrified. and my heart is broken for that poor boy, his friends and family, and all of the innocent kids who saw such a horrific scene unfold 4 days before their summer holidays began.

i was advised to add a little more to this but i don't really have any more to add. it's simple really, i don't understand why it is necessary for the admissions team to even know these characteristics. while obviously for many schools there are interviews, in those cases it would be anonymous up until you where offered to come in for an interview. they shouldn't even be given a name, just an application number at the top. this would combat racism, sexism, nepotism, and hopefully any other bias that might affect the application process if even by a small percent.

i'm talking about the subtle idea that men hunt women and women are the prey. for example:

it's common for women to think that being easy is an insult and even say that to a woman they don't like. some guys also think that, but most don't care if you're easy or hard to get.

it's common for women to swoon about a guy and find that ""cute"". but if a guy does it, it's creepy and a loser thing to do.

if two men talk about how hot some woman is, then it's objectification and dehumanizing. if two women talk about a man being hot, it's ok and they're free spirits that live their sexuality freely.

"if women have the right to abort a child then people should have the right to voluntarily euthanasia. for example ""my body, my choice"", women (in the united states) have the right to abort a fetus if they decide if they don't want a child for either financial reasons or any other reasons they do not want to be mother for any other reason.

people that are going through depression should have the right to voluntarily euthanasia because they don't want to be alive anymore. the reason i am discussing this method of death is because imagine your suicidal struggling with mental illness and your only choices are the most gruesome methods of death such as a gun, (which gun laws are getting even stricter) and a rope, or other methods like allowing yourself to get hit by a car or train.
obviously if your struggling you don't what your family to come home to see your lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling or your brains just simply splattered like paint all over the bedroom walls and ceiling. using someone else to kill you like a truck or train imho is just selfish and not morally right, imagine leaving a burden on them because they technically are the cause of your death and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.

another reason people should be entitled to euthanasia because the mental healthcare system in the us is a joke. take it from me, a person that's been having expensive therapy sessions for over 4 years with many different therapists and i admit i have tried suicide once which is what gotten me therapy in the first place. the second time i felt suicidal tendencies i called an anonymous hotline just to talk about feeling worthless and a few minutes later i had a bunch of squad cars at my door.

how come people on death row get euthanasia after the government spends more money housing and caring for inmates than the people in mental hospitals that's been suffering for years and wish for the sweet release of death?

my grandmothers brother had suffered from dementia in the last 2 years of his life in hospice, on some days he would smile upon seeing his sisters face and on the other days he would speak gibberish and start ranting. i'm sure he didn't understand the concept of what was going on his mind but i'm sure he begged for the mental and emotional pain to go away.

i remember he got in trouble because of some offensive tweets about jewish people. not only were the tweets completely unwarranted, they weren't even funny. he was trying to make a jew joke and it straight up and down wasn't even funny. so i watched his netflix special at the time. not only was it not funny, it was one of the more worse standup specials on netflix, and i've seen almost all of them.

so i watched him on the daily show for months, thinking he'll eventually get into a groove and a good zone to start unleashing that high-octane wit that was associated with the program. i genuinely, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart tried to get into him, for so long, and that same lame-ass, tired, run-into-the-ground racial observations, penis jokes and impersonations of different accents that was the bread and butter for his standup didn't change. at least the daily show was good at calling out media bullshit, but now under trevor it has just become a mouthpiece for the media bullshit that jon worked so passionately to combat.

**tl;dr**: i know that humor is subjective, but from my earnest and sincere perspective, gained by watching hours of the show, and all of his netflix specials, my opinion has only solidified that not only is he not a funny/good comedian, but he is one of the worst out there, along with jeff dunham, gabriel iglesias, and... fuck it, ricky gervais.",6

money is not a problem, because your kids are thankful enough to give you what you need without you having to ask, especially if you are a pensioner. the kids are happy because they get to hang out at grandpas place with their cousins, instead of being in some evening kindergarten with bored caretakers getting paid minimum wage.

redditors like to treat family as some sort of inconvenience that you should strive to break apart from in order to become independent, but that is not true. your family is your origins. it is the people you should be able to trust, you should always try to help. and you should always be able to depend on. they are the one people on the planet you should always feel at home with. it's natural.

i think the idea that parents shoukd leave their kids to fend for themselves is pushed by corporations, and by now is part of american culture thanks to them. 

think about it - instead of taking care for their kids a little longer, parents use the money to buy themselves a new car, or a pool, or expensive holidays. $.

instead of loaning money from their parents, the kids have to take loans from a bank. $.

then, once the parents grow up have a family instead, they know that the grandparents won't take care of the kids themselves and they have to take them to a kindergarten $ and eventually to after school care $.

after the grandparents grow old and senile, you can be sure that their kids wont want to take care of them. and so they get sent to a nursing home. $.

and as a little bonus: during all that time, all people involved will feel kind of empty, and kind of sad. not full blown depression by any means, but there will always be a hole that cannot be filled. because biologically, homo sapiens *needs* to have a family. its how we evolved and lived for millennia. and how do we attempt to fill that hole?

"computer science should be mandatory in middle/high school, even at a very basic level, just like math and history.. every person who ever learned to program will agree with me, that learning computer science is learning a new way of thinking, that is useful for almost every scenario. it teaches you how to think algorithmically, it helps you develop a great sense of logic, and it is super useful.

students are somewhat upset that they need to learn math or history when they are certain it will not come in use once they leave highschool. although they are(at least math) relevant to life out of school, if there is something that you can't argue about it's relevance and usefulness in the outside world, it's computer science.

"holding students back from leaving the classroom due to one student acting up causes them to hate the teacher, not the one student.. apparently my coworkers believe i should of held my class back today and not just the one student.

apparently the students would hate the one student for holding them up and not teacher.

i always hated that because i could hear the grumbles and mumbles of an angry students. and the anger is towards me and not the one student. 

i feel like it is better to escort my class to the lunchroom. and escort the one student back to my class. that one student will see and hear all of their classmates having a fun time in the lunch room. laughing, talking, goofing around, and trading food.

and be bummed sitting in the classroom alone and board with me. all i do is text my husband, go on reddit, and grade papers. that one student has to eat and think about their actions.

and after lunch my students get to run around and play on the playground. depending how disruptive the student was, i keep them in for 5 or 10 minutes.

during this time i make the one student clean desks, staple papers together, or other minor stuff. 

after they are done, i ask them if they understood why i kept them in. add a heart to heart chat. tell them i appreciate the work they did in my room today. and let them go.

but today my coworkers told me i am doing it wrong. i need to keep my whole class in. the students will hate that one student and the one student will feel guilty enough to stop. friends giving the friend the stink eye ensures that they won't act up again.

however 4/5 times the one student acting up is just part of a bigger problem. there could be stress at home that is causing them to act out. having them alone in my room, time to calm down, think things out, and a heart to heart talk shows them that this is a safe place to talk with a trusted adult. 

it could be something small like stressing out over the next test. or something big. i have had the toughest of bullies crying in my room because their parents are divorcing and they think it is all their fault.

i tried telling this to my coworker but they say if the student is really having trouble at home, they will to come to us for help.

i can't get half my students to admit when they need a pencil. i have one kid so shy he only speaks to me, the librarian, and his parents in whisper. took me five months for me to get him to nod yes and no to me in front of the other students.

i don't know where my co-workers are getting the outgoing students.

honestly, my shy student will be the only one happy staying in my room for lunch if one student acts up. but the rest will have the look of murder in their eyes. 

more so if it is friday and pizza is being severed in the lunchroom. hell if i hold my students up for a second on pizza day there will be a riot in my room. 

i been doing this since i first started teaching a couple years ago. then again, i am a young teacher. and my coworkers are a bit older. does experience have to do with it? will i change my mind when i am older? 

for now, my method works. my class average is above the rest of my coworkers. my students are happy in class. i have a couple of students i see during recess and after school that just need to talk some stuff out.

"putin is right to tell greta to """"go and explain to developing countries why they should continue living in poverty and not be like sweden"". source(https://www.news18.com/news/world/explain-it-to-developing-countries-vladimir-putin-dismisses-greta-thunbergs-un-speech-on-climate-change-2331415.html)

putin is a corrupt dictator, a dick with few if any redeeming characteristics, and he does not give two fucks about any developing country.

that does not change the fact that he is fundamentally right on this.

for most of the developing world,  the cost of entry/adoption of renewable energy is prohibitively expensive.

if you are a developing country like nigeria, for example, you desperately need to build and run massive water cleaning plants for you capital, lagos, with a population of 22 million people, most of which lack sewerage and clean water.  you also need to build infrastructure like bridges, a train/subway system, tunnels, roads, airports, etc...all of that takes lots of electricity, concrete, steel, and lots and lots of co2 emissions. nigeria is very very rich in oil by the way, which they can extract quite cheaply.

so it would be a very interesting conversation to watch when some privileged kid from a rich country who always benefited from an amazing infrastructure build on the back of fossil fuels, tells nigeria that they should not build that inexpensive coal/oil power plant in order to run that water purification plant that they desperately need, because they will be worse off in the end due to global warming. that they should wait many more years and save a lot more money to build a solar power plant instead (never mind the issues of energy storage or running the water plants at night).

yes, many of their children might die of dysentery in the mean time, but on the long run, it will be better for the planet. it would be a truly fascinating conversation to watch.

"teenagers are old enough to understand the consequences of their actions and cannot be excused from being responsible for them because ""their brain isn't fully developed."". recently, i was reading the comments (on reddit) for an article about the sentencing of a teenager for dropping rocks onto a highway from an overpass. i noticed that some people said that, since the accused were only teenagers, their impulse control areas of their brains hasn't fully developed yet and so they couldn't be held completely responsible for the death of the man who was struck by a rock they dropped (or something similar to those words.)

i come from a country with a very strong family identity, so to imagine a wayward teenager simply ending another person's life doing something clearly and obviously dangerous is inexcusable. it is very easy to see that dropping rocks of an overpass onto oncoming traffic could easily lead to a loss of life, and so a teenager cannot be excused from their actions simply by stating that they are not mature enough or they cannot foresee the consequences of their actions, because, as i have said earlier, it is plain to anybody with an ounce of common sense that doing so can kill someone, a fact most likely obvious to the teenagers who did it (and who probably did it because this could happen.)

edit: to all those saying that teenagers' brains are not yet fully developed and so cannot judge the consequences of their actions, my response to you is this: would you say the same for a 14-year-old who murders or rapes someone? by that age, all children should clearly know what is right and what is wrong especially in terms of actions that can hurt or kill others or themselves.

i didn't expect this to blow up like it did.

i don't underestimate. i've been there.

i'm not saying people who kill themselves in this manner are  annoying me persay, i'm saying their actions by killing themselves in that manner can potentially fuck up the lives of strangers. innocent people like the bus driver just doing his job. the kid going to school. the person struggling with their own mental demons. 

how is that not selfish?

how is that not wrong?

it's terrible when people feel they need to end it all. some, like me, get help or pull themselves through it. some don't and that's tragic.

"reddit is too hard to actively participate in due to ridiculous sub rules, post formating, tyrannical mods, and rude users. no wonder a majority of the user base doesn't participate.. i don't quite know where to start, but so many subs make it frustrating to actively participate in them. if you want to post content, you have to first check sub rules, then make sure the post title is formatted, and then hope that the mods don't use the extremely vague rules to remove your post. even if your posts stays up, you have to then make sure people aren't rude assholes about what opinions or content you dare share.

it's like a pack of ravenous wolves waiting to rip whatever words you have to shreds.
do you have a cool idea for something, and want to share? well that's too bad, because a dozen users are waiting to tell you how you're wrong, and your ideas are terrible.

so you have to find good content, and meticulously make sure it fits sub rules, nazi mod's personal tastes, and make sure it can't get picked apart by smartass redditors looking to ""well actually"" you with some swift ""facts"" they pulled from a 10 year old unreputable article. 

it's exhausting. on top of which, reddit sometimes blocks posting for a number of minutes in certain subs, so if you fuck up a title by accident, you have to wait 5-10 minutes to actually fix your mistakes, and by then, i'm usually just frustrated beyond interest anymore. 

it's just not a fun environment to participate in. no wonder people respond with generic jokes and low efforts comments, because that's the easiest way to just slide into participating without worrying about much. 

posting opinions is exhausting, no matter how innocent you think they are, or even if you are just having fun with hypotheticals. an opinion post always has to be self aware enough to deconstruct every smartass counter argument before you even hit the submit button, and it's exhausting. 

want to ask/ express why the new corvette should be offered in purple? well you'll have 20 people tell you it's stupid, it's not financially feasible, and it'll never sell. 

defending yourself on anything just gets you in trouble, and mods with never take your side with anything. a mod will never side with you over another mod. you can't barter with these people. you can't logically defend anything against their decisions. 

no matter how innocent the sub seems, the mods always seem to be on a power trip. 

it's honestly just not ""fun"". the ""reddit is fun"" app should be named ""reddit isn't fun"". 

i honestly don't understand what it is about human nature, where eveyone has to be a negative dickhead. i don't get why everything has to be overly structured to the point of sucking the very enjoyment from the activity. 

and those are both rhetorical questions. something most redditors can't grasp for some reason. 

you can stalk my history. i get frustrated with things, but i try not to pick fights for the sake of doing it. i don't troll. arguing is just a waste of energy on here. i just like to express my interest in certain things, and hope other like minded people chime in. the issue is no like minded people ever chime in for much. it's always people telling you how wrong you are, but never someone backing you up. it's just exhausting. 

for the love of god active reddit users, reply to people's opinions you stand by with something positive, and stop being so damn negative all the time. life can be negative enough. don't let it spill into everything you do. 

fight for less strict rules if you get frustrated, and go through the proper reporting channels to put tyrannical mods in their place. this place just gets worse the more nobody does anything about it.

also the thing is, many teachers suck. they literally just read off slideshows and textbooks, in my opinion only maths and science teachers really deserve credit. 

when i was in grade 5 my one teacher left halfway through the year and came back the next year (presumably with full pay) because she couldn't handle how naughty the kids were. like woman, that's your job. also, when i was in grade 10 my accounting teacher had a breakdown because one of the kids told her she was a shitty teacher (and truth be told, he wasn't wrong). she went crazy at him, kicked him out of the class and didn't come to work for 2 weeks after that. like, wtf. i worked as a waiter for several years during college and if a customer complained about me, i'd have to just suck it up and carry on, i couldn't lose my cool at the customer and god forbid i'd go awol for 2 weeks. 

so yeah. teachers like to act like they sacrificed their lives for the good of education, which they didn't. they chose to teach as a career and must deal with the good and bad aspects of the job.",6

people need to start standing up for themselves more. there is nothing wrong with directly disagreeing or arguing against something you aren't okay with. we need to stop bottling animosity up and venting about it to randoms instead of dealing with the problem.

"some people are just plain stupid and should be given up on. i'm a tutor and a substitute teacher working on getting a full time credential. the mantra is always something about no child left behind or how every kid has potential to do good. 

no. some kids are just fucking stupid. 

i've tutored a high schooler who legitimately did not know what 2+2 was, and they weren't special ed or trying to be funny or anything like that. some people are just stupid and it's their own fault they fail, not the fault of anyone around them. no amount of extra hard work from their teachers or tutors will make them smarter. they'll always be stupid. they're the kids where you painstakingly walk them through every single step in solving a problem, and then for the next one they have no idea what to do even though it's the exact same problem with slightly different numbers or words, and then you repeat this process every day 5 days a week until it's summer break and you've gotten nowhere the entire time with them. 

they should be given up on. these people don't even want to succeed in academics. they're the ones talking about how you can't ask a fish to climb a tree to justify how it's okay that they suck at important life skills but they're semi decent at fortnite dancing and hot dog eating, as if the skills are comparable in value. not only are they so thick that their brain is locked behind an impenetrable brick wall, but they straight up don't even think an education is valuable so they don't give a shit anyways. it's a waste of everyone's time to force teachers to teach at the pace of the slowest kid, take time away from those who can learn to dedicate more time to the idiot, and to hire a tutor to try to magically make the idiot smarter. 

valuable time and resources dedicated to helping these failures shouldn't be given to them. that extra time should be spent working with the kids who actually can learn and want to learn. plenty of parents have thrown hundreds of dollars at me a month to make their kid smarter and get better grades, only for their kid to be completely hopeless. it was a waste of their money and i knew from the first day that their kid wouldn't learn shit from me. 

these kids just need to be left behind. it's not right to make everyone else worse off just to try to pour resources and time into a human who's brain is a bag with a hole in the bottom. 

edit: just wanted to point out that someone took the time to pm me and say i'm a dick and a toad because people make way more money playing fortnite and eating hotdogs than the $5 an hour he assumes teachers make. i'll just let that stand for itself. 

edit 2: just to clarify since i can't reply to hundreds of comments, what i am not advocating for is throwing these kids out on the streets. what i am saying is that right now the sole goal of our education system is to get kids into college. that should change. some kids aren't capable of that and that's okay. we should push some people into more realistic work and blue collar jobs instead of only trying to get kids to have a high enough gpa for college. give up on trying to teach a kid a life skill they won't use and try teaching them something else valuable to society.",6
"it isn't ""amazing"" that a person with disabilities half-asses something able-bodied people do.. i figure this one will make me sound like a real jerk, but hear me out.

it seems like every day i see some video on facebook with sappy music where some person with a disability performs a feat that a person with that disability doesn't typically perform. it leads to a bunch of congratulation and applause by everyone. but it never makes sense to me. 

i think creating tasks and events for someone with limitations is perfectly viable. special olympics? hell yeah. the story of a blind kid being allowed to play football on a team of able-bodied kids? come on. 

i recently saw a video of a girl with cerebral palsy who took up boxing. cue amazement from everyone. but she's having people cater specifically to her disability, and the message is supposed to be that she overcame the odds... 

except that all she actually does it flail around on her knees with gloves on while someone kneels down so she can hit the hand pads... kinda. she hasn't overcome anything because she's not actually achieving a task beyond awkwardly slapping her hands about. it isn't really boxing, so calling it that is kind of silly. she's still not ""normal"", and no one is fooled into believing she is. it's a spectacle, and i'm not impressed - i'm cringing. 

i once saw a video of a guy with a severe physical limitation completing an obstacle course of sorts. except he didn't. he was pulled and carried through most of it while someone filmed the pitiful experience. there was nothing inspirational about it because nothing was actually overcome. he just created a spectacle and inconvenienced a bunch of people who ultimately felt sorry for him. the course wasn't made for his limitations, and he accomplished nothing. 

hell, i have severe back and nerve issues, so i can't lift much weight. therefore, i don't work in a field that requires it, and i sometimes have my wife carry heavier items. them's the breaks. 

and please understand, i'm not implying that i believe that people with disabilities are less of a human or that they deserve any less respect or love. but every being on the planet has built-in limitations. there's nothing wrong with living within them, and sorta-kinda doing something you can't really do isn't impressive or inspirational. it's awkward. 

tldr:

a disabled person isn't ""overcoming a disability"" by creating a spectacle and pretending they can do what able-bodied people can do, and the ""amazement"" people feel when seeing someone half-ass accomplish something like this is just a more optimistic form of pity. they're well aware that the disabled person isn't truly accomplishing the task in any realistic manner, and so is the disabled person. 

don't pretend to be something you're not. if you can't truly accomplish a task the real way, it's not made for your limitations, and that's okay. you're still awesome.",6
"friends is an overrated show and shouldn't have been kept on netflix at the cost of increased subscription payments. although friends is considered to be loved by ""everyone"", it has been blown out of proportion by fans claiming it to be the best thing on tv forever and always. i don't think that people who only have netflix to watch friends, or people that say they will cancel their subscription if its removed are serious. just buy the box set for friends and for a single price, why keep paying a monthly subscription to just watch a single show? netflix has paid around $100 million for the show to stream throughout 2019, and the payment before that was $30 million according to new york times. that money could've been spent getting more recent shows and movies that people want or enjoyed to continue to stream on the service for more that 6 months in some instances.

"teachers should not be allowed to express their political opinions in school.. bit of context for this. when i was 16 (in 2006) i studies politics in the uk. both my teachers supported labour as did almost all of the class, but that isn't the issue. the issue came about when i made a prediction that the conservatives would win the next general election (they did). now, this wasn't me declaring any support for either party. it was literally just an observation. my teacher then went on to explain how bad the conservative party is, how everybody in the class should vote labour and that i was a 'tory boy'. basically for the next two years my opinions and views in class were null and void because, and i quote, ""don't listen to the tory boy"". also, other classmates who had different opinions to the class and teachers aligned with them to make sure they didn't get the same vitriol thrown their way.

to be clear, i have no issue with teachers telling student's who they voted for. i do take issue when they seek to impose their opinions on the class. they're there to educate. not dictate.

"public school teachers are overpaid, not underpaid.. very unpopular opinion that i have literally received death threats for. 

public school teachers in the united states earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  this is far too high.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/public-school-teacher-salary.html

i'm not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  i am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. this artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (the purpose of a union). it's revealed in the numbers.  private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  some estimates are as low as $37,000.  

https://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=private_school_teacher/salary

teachers union convention, nea top official - it's not for the kids, it's for the power.

https://youtu.be/bam8n24k8ke

2.  the median household income in the united states is only about $62,000.  that means that one teacher's income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

but wait billy mays, there's more. 

3.  teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since christmas and new years etc. happen for everyone - 

annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

and please, don't tell me ""teachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.""  stop it.  third grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and i know teachers who do just that. 

teaching is not easy, but it's not hard either.  and yes, before you say ""try it once and stand in my shoes"" - i have.  

4.  on average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  they are more facilitators than professionals. 

""these kids get out of high school and can't even read.""  

proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it's measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  math often under 50%.  half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

it's because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  and when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it's unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

you can peruse this trove of data if you like.  it's fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=ffoption3#faqffoption3

""it's the parents, not us.""  

you'll often hear this in response.  and it's true, parents are extremely important in little johnnie's life and success.  but that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  they are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little billy the bully ready even when he's a dick and won't pay attention.  the gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn't do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  her job is to get slow witted corky some knowledge because he can't learn on his own. 

5.  schools are becoming prison camps.  for what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  i don't think it's because there were no donnie the drug dealer and billy the bully when we generation xers were growing up.  it's because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  there is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  cops are everywhere.  students have few if any rights.  the kids are treated with disrespect and 'zero-tolerance' policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  it gets worse each year. 

i do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  i believe it's because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that ""teachers are overworked and underpaid"" has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  they have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/so_gkquuisc

like i said, i've had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  it's dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it's about the power.

"the reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.. now i want to start this by saying i don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

women are picky af. men aren't. it's in our genetics.

for a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. you gotta have -

1. good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. you usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. you need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. you usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. a woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. a man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

if a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

a man doing this? no way. it's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. and if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

there have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

"correcting someone elses child's disrespectful behavior should be acceptable. i was recently at a party and one of the partygoers brought their child. i have nothing against kids but this little one was being an outright menace. he started screaming and crying when the cake was being served because he wasn't the first one to get cake and then flipped his mom off when she asked him to stop. he's four. it was extremely uncomfortable because mom did nothing and awkwardly stood there and just let this happen. party continues and he then is pitching golf balls at a window. my fiance asks him nicely to stop (there were other kids nearby who she didn't want caught in the crossfire) and the mom went ballistic on her saying ""don't tell my kid how to act"" etc. if you can't be bothered to instill good behavior into your kid i feel like you shouldn't be insulted when other people do it for you

"calling a white person ""colonizer"" is equivalent to calling a black person ""spearchucker"". using the phrase colonizer is quite popular on blacktwitter when referring to whites and it seems to be on par with a white person calling a black person ""spear chucker"". referring to a person based on a historic event/action or cultural stereotype is racist like calling all japanese ""raiders/kamakazi"", somali ""pirates"", etc...

people seem to get away with it because of the belief that you cannot be racist against a white person in a western country, but that is just wrong. i believe that all things should be allowed to be said, but one cannot take the moral high ground and say they aren't racist when they say things like this

"circumcising males when they're infants should be illegal. i've never met a person who agrees with me and it's infuriating.. i think it's barbaric. the foreskin is there to protect the glans. and as an infant it is literally fused to the head of the penis. so as a newborn, males have their foreskin ripped off the head of the penis and then cut off around the rim, sometimes with no anesthetic. and idk how you care for an open wound while keeping them in diapers that will eventually smear them in shit. 

it breaks my heart that my fiance wants any future boys we have to be circumcised. and his only reason is ""i want him to look like me"". i've told him i want him there to watch and listen to his newborn cry and scream from being mutilated for cosmetic reasons. i told him he will be the only one changing his diapers and treating the wound. 


""it's gross lol"" because you've grown up in a culture that has done this since biblical times. 

it is the exact equivalent of cutting off a baby girl's labia. oh, it's for aesthetics. oh, it will make girls less prone to utis. oh, it'll eliminate smegma that builds up between the folds. oh, it'll expose a mucus membrane and desensitize the clit. oh, it'll make them less likely to get labia cancer. oh, it'll prevent stds because there's less folds for the disease to hide in.

every ""benefit"" of circumcision is a matter of hygiene and the same ""benefits"" would apply to girls who get their labia cut off.

i'm sure everyone has their own experiences, but here's a little background on me.... i was born in the us, but my parents are immigrants from the middle east.  i was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  we didn't have much growing up.  both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  i grew up in chicago.  we didn't come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  they learned how to speak english, and just went from there.  my dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  we had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  my siblings and i picked up on that, but we didn't want to add stress to them and played dumb.  they kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  at the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  we all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

so i feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  while this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  especially today as we are iraqi christians (but that's a whole other story).

i'm 32.  i've got a great job (even though i never finished college, couldn't afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn't get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), i finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, i've got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  all of my accomplishments, and my family's have been through discipline and sacrifice.  i didn't buy the nice car, i bought the used honda.  i didn't buy the fancy clothes, i went to discount stores.  i didn't eat out, i cooked every night.  i lived well within my means.

to my point.  i really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  why have people gotten so soft?  every time i turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there's a new artificial outrage that's sweeping across the country.  are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? absolutely.  but i think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  i just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  if that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the us.  is it evenly distributed? no, but life isn't fair.",6
"i'm indian. apu is not even a little bit offensive. on the contrary, he's one of the best poc representations for its era.. the simpsons debuted in 1989, when the population was way more white, and the only really existent minority was black (and maybe hispanic).  indians basically didn't exist in the us.  

typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  this is why asian characters were shitty roles, while black characters weren't; blacks made up 12% of the population, while asians were not even 1%.  white characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character apu was written to be.  

now the bad part:  his accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  i definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking indian accent.  but again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

i don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  i've seen lots of black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  i'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  that would *probably* necessitate the actor being indian though.  

for comparison, let's look at raj, from the big bang theory, which aired in 2007.  bbt pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  and that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  not to mention that bbt is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

my final take:  people crying about apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and i don't think it's a coincidence that most of the indian people i know aren't even fazed by him.  i will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

the whole ""sjws are insane"" narrative is largely overblown by fanatic right wing redditors, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, and this is one of those times.  ",6

"usain bolt is so fast because he runs with a boner. now i'm no scientist but i've always wondered why he's so fast and after studying his races for 6 weeks i've come to the conclusion that its because he runs with a boner and here's why. so aerodynamically speaking a boner cuts through the wind resistance better than a flabby dick a flabby dick acts almost like a parachute adding wind resistance to the runner thus slowing him down. but usain runs with boner thus acting like a spear cutting through the wind making the wind have the smallest affect on him. where as his opponents flabby dicks slow them down. i do believe he uses performance enhancing drugs (viagra) to get and keep these race winning boners. thank you for taking the time to read my research paper

"young people need to be taught that emotions can be deceiving, and don't necessarily reflect the state of reality. i think this is what has truly created the generation of snowflakes.. pretty much title. 

young kids growing up need to learn that their emotions don't always tell the truth, and that just because you feel a certain way, doesn't mean that your emotion is warranted. just because you feel disrespected doesn't mean you are, just because you feel angry doesn't mean you're right, etc. 

we need to focus on educating our kids about taking emotion out of it, and using rationale instead to come to conclusions.

"adults (as in humans aged 18+) should not be offended by profanity. if they are, i don't feel badly about it.. using profanity doesn't make you trashy, uneducated or violent. it allows some of us to express language in a more efficient manner. it's so universal and powerful, which makes it very tempting to use, especially for those of us who struggle with effective communication in certain scenarios.

because of cultural intensity prescribed to the word ""fuck"", its utterance tends to be a verbally cathartic experience. do we need people to hate its use, though, in order for it to retain power? in my opinion, no. 

when i was 13, i didn't appreciate the power of profanity. i misused it in an attempt to feel important and more mature (older üôÑ). at 32, i feel like i fully appreciate its role in efficient communication.

"i hate how reddit is becoming increasingly used by kids, especially those in middle school. every time i talk about this in a thread i get bombarded with downvotes,so i think this is an unpopular opinion. i think theres way too many kids on reddit. i remember when people at least pretended to be adults. why cant we have that? from my experience, alot of these kids are immature, cringey, and boastful. when kids at least pretended that they were adults, the negatives werent as noticeable.  i hate every post that begins ( im 12 but) or whatever. l think kids need to at least try to hide the fact their a kid and not brag about how immature they are

edit: people have been saying i hate kids. this isnt the case. i just take issue when some kid mentions their age on the internet as if it furthers an argument or statement they are making. if your point is solid, it can stand up without mentioning ur age. no one asked for your age. there are a few times when one would talk about age on the internet, but kids simply do talk about age at appropriate areas/threads/whatever. like ive seen 12 year olds on r/relationshipadvice. let your actions define you. ifind kids who mention age are either super serious like they are superior or super cringey. just let your actions define you. unless u try to act like an adult, people will still tell u are r/iamverysmart or a complete immature loser.

"stop remaking great films and start remaking movies that could have been great, but were poorly executed. all the time we hear stories about films with so much hype but had production issues, cast issues, etc. there's some great scripts that will probably never see the light of day because they were poorly executed on. we should remake those movies instead of ones that have already been executed greatly. 

edit: ppl keep saying studios wouldn't do this so it's useless. dark tower in an example of great source material (steven kings  magnum opus) but the film was godawful. studios could draw back a crowd if it was remade well. hancock is another one - the movie did okay but the original material was so different and in my opinion could have been a lot better. prometheus was an awesome idea but didn't really get as deep as i had hoped. all three of those i think were great ideas, poorly executed that would still make money as a remake if done right.

"animation is the superior format and live-action adaptations are always a mistake. the two easy ""exceptions"" are bumblebee which was pretty decent and beauty and the beast (nearly a frame for frame remake so not terrible, but certainly not as good as the original).

but generally speaking live action versions of children's books (cat in the hat, grinch), cartoons (flintstones, scooby doo), and comics (garfield, dennis the meanace, casper) are a shit-show. they haven't ever gotten it right because you really can't get it right. the only reason bumblebee is an exception is the quality of the animation which is to say it was good only as much as it was animated.

how many people are dying from being too thin versus too fat? how much more dangerous for the average person is diabetes, poor cardiovascular health, higher blood pressure, higher risk of stroke, knee injuries, etc. than taking in too few calories? it's inconceivable to me that on average, the effects  of glamorizing thin women would be worse than the opposite - people are fatter than ever, and most people could use a push towards less body fat, whereas helping people disregard the negative health impact of being obese is damaging for society.

"farenheit is superior to celsius. farenheit is a better system for the use case for temperatures that 99% of the population has: temperature of the weather. it's better for two reasons:

1) the scale is far more intuitive. it's approximately 0-100, with 0 being really cold and 100 being really hot. 50 is about average. temps below 0 and above 100 are possible, but rare and extreme. that tells you everything you need to know to interpret a temperature, without having personal experience with it. conversely, the same range in celsius is -18 to 38. utterly meaningless. 

2) farenheit is 2x more precise than celsius. you would never need to use decimal or ""half"" degrees, because each degree is a small increment. this is related to #1 because the precision is scaled to about 0-100.

stealth edit:  wooo front page! i feel special. 

#edit edit: the above list is channels that were recommended in the thread as good channels and also users in the thread's personal channels that i decided to list because this post is getting so much exposure to help them out. 

sorry for the misunderstanding. ",6
"i'm sick of every tv show eventually having a left leaning overtone.. it seems like every show i watch lately starts off the same way. they steer clear of any sort of left or right overtone. it's not needed for the plot and they don't put it in. i start getting into the series and then the left talking points  start to creep in.

slowly but surely the left shit seeps into the show. it might take a couple of seasons but it always starts. i can't mention any of the actual issues because of the filters but you know what i'm talking about. 

can't i just watch a fucking tv series without a having left leaning agenda pushed at me, or for that matter any agenda? especially when it's just not fucking necessary to the plot of the show.

netflix especially seems to be experts at it. every god damn show i've watched on netflix starts as just a normal good series and 2 seasons in switches to propaganda. 

edit: designated survivor is the series that got me to write this post but i've seen many examples. about two seasons in its as if they ran out of plot and went full blown propaganda, checking off every box they could.",6
"using ""gay"" and ""retard"" in a playfull way as an insult shouldnt trigger anyone.  when people say gay and retard it doesnt mean that they think being gay is bad theyre just saying it because thats just what theyve always said i wouldnt get triggered by it, also im sure retarded people dont mind you saying retard

 i have a retarded cousin and i know when people call others retards its just a silly term and i know not to be offended because its not like they hate retards or anything, there is no reason to be mad at these things its not actually doing any harm and thier intentions are just to use an adjective.",6
"i think people pretend to like bob ross more than they actually do.. liking him seems like some kind of unwritten rule, and half of the people who play up to that are doing nothing more than capitalising on his popularity and have likely never watched an episode of the joy of painting in their lives.",6
"people shouldn't complain about privacy while they at the same time share everything about their life on social media.. i had a discussion with a co-worker today. we talked about surveillants. i thought that london and places in japan did the right thing by installing a bunch of cameras around the cities. it has prevented and solved a lot of crimes. he didn't agree. he said that he wanted his privacy. he went on and on about the huge privacy issues we have today. like how the government scans and reads our emails and yada yada. i simply asked him ""if privacy is so important to you, how come you share everything about your life on social media? you upload photos of yourself, your kids and your wife. you have your house and address online. you share your work and expensive stuff you own. how come you're so concerned about privacy when you're giving 100% away every day?"". he didn't have an answer for that at all.

i get that you want privacy regarding money, bank information, and other personal stuff. but other than that, what do you have left to protect by not installing cameras everywhere?",6
"just because i'm a male, doesn't mean that my problems are invalid or any less important.. yes there are many men who are rich and in power. yes forbes lists and company executives are dominate by men. i get it. guess what, me and everyone else reading this is likely not a part of that elite.

guys get too much shit for no reason. yes women's issues are a thing. yes there is repression and many many problems for many many minorities. those problems need to be solved, but here i am eating a shit sandwhich for having a dick?

when's the last time you heard of a widely available support network for men? higher suicide rates, higher incarceration rates, un-realistic expectations. innocent guys getting punished with heavy sentences for false rape claims. guys being told to 'man-up' when they dare complain about anything. prostate cancer rates higher than breast cancer, with a fraction of the non-for-profits that are specialized for it. 

it's tough out there. there are people out there that are doing great work for men, great advice and great support. i'm very thankful for these people and organisations.

and make no mistake, this isn't throwing blame, or taking away from other worthy causes. domestic violence is real and prevalent, rape is despicable and ever present. 

but hey, men have their issues too. the two mentioned above also applies to us. and apparently bringing up this opinion immediately makes you or me sexist.",6
"everyone walks so god damn slow it annoys me every day.. like you know when you are faster than them but not being able to pass them as you walk a little bit faster which will be akward but if you go faster than normal its also weird? i just don't get why people walk so damn slow they take like 5 minutes to walk 10 meters its very annoying so please walk faster. also don't forget the people who stop walking for no damn reason they need to rot in the worst place in hell lol

"in schools, athletics are put on a way too high of a priority. i'm not really talking about high schools, middle schools, etc. i'm talking about university. colleges in general are *way* too willing to blow thousands on a *game.*

now i get it, there's a slim possibility that someone is going to the pros. however, first of all, sports contribute little to nothing to society, other then entertainment. second of all, someone studying science for example is *way* more likely to enter a realistic, high paying, and beneficial job after graduation. 

where's the proof? check out this link. 
https://hepinc.com/newsroom/state-universities-spending-over-100000-per-athlete-8-to-12-times-more-than-academics/

some universities are spending *12 times* the amount of money on a athletic student in contrast to a academic one. are you serious? i get it, ok? sports are fun, and there is a chance that one of your players will get to the pros. however, academics are *important.* that's the difference. you really don't mean to tell me that universities are willing to blow *12x* the amount of money on entertainment rather then the actual main focus of their college. 

by the way, you may be thinking that this is all worth it due to revenue from games, right? check out this statistic.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-06/college-football-teams-are-risky-and-expensive-and-schools-keep-adding-them

an average of a million in revenue. that's a lot. except that it's simply not enough for the cost. a typical fcs school football team costs 3.5 *million* to maintain. and that's not even accounting for stadium costs, maintenance, coaches and staff (not sure about this one, article didn't specify if they're actually covered), etc. 

let's say a school did actually manage to make up for that. is it really worth it? is a student who's could make the greatest touchdown really worth more then a student who could possibly cure cancer? it's just all so pointless to me. i get it, you need to have some fun, but it shouldn't be getting in the way of students who want to get success through academic means rather then athletic means.",6
"small boobs are great. i used to be really self conscious about how flat i am, like i was scared guys wouldn't like me because of it. 

and then i kinda just stopped caring and realized small boobs are awesome. like, i bought a bra at target for like 9 dollars and it works perfectly fine. my friends that wear bigger cup sizes have to pay 40 or 50 dollars for a decent bra.

on top of that, my boobs don't weigh me down and aren't in the way. i feel comfortable running or jumping, and sports bras are actually comfortable. all in all, small boobs rock

edit: also, by small, i'm talking like aas and as and bs, like that kind of small",6
"banana laffy taffy is the only flavor of laffy taffy worth eating. all the other flavors suck. artificial banana is usually awful as well, but banana laffy taffy is the exception. i could eat a whole bag of the banana but i won't even touch any of the other ""flavors"". not that i've done any statistical analysis of the general populations laffy taffy consumption choices, but it seems like many people dislike banana. and to those folks i say get 'outta here!",6
"""s/he started it"" is a totally justifiable excuse. when i was a kid i was horribly bullied, and when i fought back and teachers saw it and i got in trouble, i would say ""he started it!"" only to be told that didn't justify my behavior.

well, it's 30 years later and i still don't see my teacher's point. in fact,i just think the teachers back then didn't want to deal with the horrible behavior of their kids and wanted to sweep it under the rug.

but fucking hell, if someone starts some shit, the person being attacked is 100% justified to respond with equal or greater force. don't want your ass beat? don't start shit.

anyone who starts the problem is always more guilty than the responding party.",6
there's nothing homophobic about not wanting a gay son or daughter.. i'd want my kids to be straight. if they ended up not being straight it'd be perfectly fine and i'd attempt to be there for them the best that i can be. i wouldn't resent or disown them for it. ,6
