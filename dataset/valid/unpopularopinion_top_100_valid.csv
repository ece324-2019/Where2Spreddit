"eating cereal with water is better than with milk. i am a true believer that cereal with water is better. the taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. while still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. my friends crucified me when i told them this...so for this reason i am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

edit: i pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them. 

humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. stop the violence and protect the planet. why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",6
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below. edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"pedophiles who are trying to get help are brave.. it takes a lot of balls to admit that you're attracted to children. if they are trying to get help, they shouldn't be attacked by people for being a bad person. a pedophile is not a bad person until they actually commit an offence.",6
"if the father of your child is still active in their life and paying child support, you're not a single mother, you're a single woman.. i think people make a big deal about how hard it is to be a single parent when they have joint custody, their ex wants to be in their child's life, and they receive  child support and/or alimony, even though the only thing that's different between them and me is that someone sleeps in my bed at night.

eta: i didn't think this would get so much response. but since everyone is in my inbox making assumptions, let me clarify and say that a really quick internet search would have shown you i'm a 30 year old white married woman with kids ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not a bitter dude who pays child support. calm down.

"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness. 

calling someone out for basically being into pedophilia or bestiality and hiding it as a fetish or kink that should be understood and respected isn't 'kinkshaming', it's just being a concerned citizen and perfectly fine.",6

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

social media has like minded individuals the opportunity to find each other and create a larger voice. we act like we're living in a world where the average person is this upset by everything snowflake when it reality the average person is as sick of it as everyone else. i mean how many of you have actually met one of these people? because i only hear about people getting upset with things like ""baby it's cold outside"" ",6
"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less.

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

‚Ä¢	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did‚Äîdespite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

‚Ä¢	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

‚Ä¢	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

‚Ä¢	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

‚Ä¢	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 ‚Äì 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 ‚Äì higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

‚Ä¢	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ‚ô™siiilver and gooold‚ô™!!",6
"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant.¬†every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

so nice try, mr. president. i know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. maybe it isn't significant if one person cooks their frozen italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you're a thinker. you're looking at the grand  scheme of things. millions of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? that's straight theft, my man. and i ain't giving in to that scheme .",6

i'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). expanding on what i said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. it's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",6

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled. i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea) 

not once have i ever felt ""yeah, i'm experiencing something i couldn't back at home""

when you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

i've hiked on mountains, i've swam in oceans, ive been on the london eye, i've run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have i felt ""yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away""

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

with the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. like, really well.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).

"whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.. https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

#edit 2: omg thanks for the gold guys, i really appreciate it! omg i also got gilding! thank you stranger. i am so blessed. i love you!

edit 3: google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". i dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. claiming i'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually worse because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

for anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>i live in aus and about 11 years ago i used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with america, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the us for one summer. she went over there an had an inappropriate 'romance' with a camp attendee. he was 15 and she was 20. the boys parents found out and had her charged. she went to a women's prison in iowa. her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the us to try and get her sent back home. she is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. she is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. she is banned from ever travelling to the us. imo she got what she deserved.

thank you, poster. this made my day much better.",6
"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

edit: i appreciate so much the work that passionate teachers make and the incredibly positive impact they've had on my life and the ones of billions of people. this post is about bad teachers, but i have to make it clear good teachers exist too.",6

"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun.. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

edit: spelling.

edit 2: i never imagined this would get so popular. answering to the comments now seems an impossible task, anyway i'd like to clarify some points some of you must have not grasp:
- i'm not saying the death of a child is worthless. to those who told me i should kill myself because i'm advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can't even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".
- it's not a competition but it doesn't mean things can't be discussed 
- english is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit i'm sorry but couldn't care less.

what you're doing is making people who tell jokes like this tell them in private, you're not helping in your cause. being offended is a choice and i'm sure you americans can choose to ignore old tweets. back 2008 you could still go on stage in a stand up comedy club and say the word faggot in a joke and people would laugh.

so as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

it appears as though companies can do what they want to the ""little people"" as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care.

edit: a lot of people are saying ""why not both"", but the answer is in the post. being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so i feel like it shouldn't be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

also i would like to add that pretty much anything you can't change like your skin color and face should be a part of it too. i have to thank some people in the comments for opening my eyes on that opportunity. the reason i chose height is because i personally feel like short people get shit on possibly more than anything else. if you think that's bullshit, scroll down and you'll see countless comments of people calling me ""manlet"", ""incel"", and ""midget""",6

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed¬†by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly¬†1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child¬†being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6

"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6
"everyone loves free speech until the views expressed don't line up with your own. both the left and right wings of politics do this, and reddit is especially guilty. reddit tends to have a very set group of acceptable opinions, e.g. fortnite bad, instagram bad, etc, and are utterly uncompromising and will beat people to shit for having opposing views. it's a cancerous mentality and it's poisoning the community.",6
"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6
"people are much more attractive partially clothed than naked.. enough said. genitals are odd-looking and kind of ugly. ladies, have you ever seen a limp dick? it looks like a sad, floppy noodle. tits usually look better in bras, i've seen a lot of weird nipples. i find men and women in underwear/lingerie a lot more attractive than completely naked, i guess it leaves everything to the imagination?

"if alcohol was invented today it would be prohibited. imagine if alcohol wasn't with us in culture and society since ages, and the drug was invented today.

alcohol causes more deaths and injuries than all other drugs together, combined. the ""accidents"" on the roads due to alcohol worldwide, the number of domestic violence cases, fights in bars and on the street in places where you can go out. 

suicides, shortening of life span for those who use it, liver problems, brain problems, problem problems

this is one hell of a hard drug, deaths and problems everywhere but because it's culture, we are fine with it.

if it was invented now, it would be on the prohibited substance list very soon after.",6
"boneless wings are better than bone in.. more meat. tasty breading. less likely to be dry and stringy. no worries about cracking a tooth on a bone, or chewing cartilage on accident. it's also more socially acceptable to eat with a fork than regular bone in - you'll look like a lunatic if you put a wing on the end of your fork like that. which means no sticky, smelly fingers. you'll be free to touch other parts of the table without having to take a wet napkin to your hand every time!

"reddit mods are the lowest form of human life there is.. mods are basically unpaid mall cops for reddit... except even mall cops know they are a joke.  i think reddit counts on the fact there are enough lonely losers out there who will moderate the site for free in exchange for the illusion of authority.  these are shameful, powerless, and deeply troubled people looking to exert a measure of power anyway they can-- the same kind of people who would become abusive police officers and border agents if they weren't already so monstrously overweight.

edit: i apologize for the bit about mall cops.  they are just trying to make a living.  comparing them to reddit mods is a slur that i regret.

"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace.. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

because of their crusade on gmos, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

they personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. they have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. they are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

edit #1: a slight correction on the ddt point. it was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. it was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. however, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that ddt is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

edit #2: holy hell, that's a lot of reddit stickers. thanks lads.",6
