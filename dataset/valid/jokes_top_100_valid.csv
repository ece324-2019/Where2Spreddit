"this is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory. a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, ""lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.

""sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. you'll have to step outside to smoke.""

so the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. they bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. they try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

the bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""hey you two!"" he shouts. ""stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",0

the lion abruptly stops and says "" woah! this guy seems tougher then he looks, i better leave while i can"". 

over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. so the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily ""get on my back, we'll get him together"". 

so they start rushing back to the dog. the dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. he then gets another idea and shouts ""where the hell is that monkey! i told him to bring me another lion an hour ago...""

"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave. dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

"a mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. so, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

""ah, my letter.  thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  please do so again"" replies the buddhist monk.

""but sir,"" says mailman, ""you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.""

""but that is my intention, dear man,"" replies the buddhist monk.  ""you see, reposting is the best way to get karma.""

the daughter replied, ""i'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest i'll ever get to a husband.""

a couple of days later the mother heard the humming sound again, this time in the living room. 
in there, she found her husband watching the super bowl on television with the vibrator buzzing away beside him.

""what are you doing?"" she exclaimed. 

he replied............""watching the game with my son-in-law.""",0

"the husband leans over and asks his wife. ""do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you.""

yes, she says, ""i remember it well.""

ok, he says, ""how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",0

"my girlfriend told me this joke ten years ago. we've been married nine years today..  a penguin is driving to the mall when all of a sudden his engine starts running really rough, and smoke is coming from under the hood.  luckily, there's an auto repair shop right next to the mall, so he pulls in there.  the mechanic says he'll be glad to take a look, but he won't be able to get to it for a couple hours.  the penguin says fine, and walks across the street to the mall.

he kills time walking around the mall, does some window shopping, buys an ice cream cone, etc.  finally the two hours are up and he goes back to the mechanic.

the penguin says, ""have you had time to look at my engine?""

the mechanic says, ""yeah, it looks like you blew a seal.""

the penguin says, ""no, that's just ice cream.""

"can admins of this subreddit reddit do a better job of monitoring who is allowed in here please?!. we have a new member, a woman. she's been privately messaging members, sending them naked pictures of herself in nasty poses along with close ups of her unmentionables. she is offering an iphone 8+ in exchange for sexual favors. i am especially bothered because it turned out to be an iphone 6 and obviously something's wrong with it. it's super slow and the caps lock is stuck on.

edit: thank you for the gold mate
