""Go stand at the periscope entry-way, and make sure no unauthorized personnel touch the periscope.""

The recruit follows orders, and stands by the periscope. After 15 minutes, the officer stops by.

""Son I'm changing your post to the mess hall. Go in there and start washing some dishes.""

The recruit obeys, and heads to the mess hall. He's cleaned about 3 dishes when the officer walks up again.
