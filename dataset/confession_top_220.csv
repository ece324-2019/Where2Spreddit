"i ghosted my boyfriend of 5 years.. i came over to his house one morning to surprise him with breakfast and a video game he wanted, only to find him naked, asleep, and  with his ex curled up in his arms.

he didn't hear me come in, so i closed his bedroom door, and left his breakfast and game on the kitchen counter along with my key to his house.

i went to my car, deactivated my facebook, and blocked him on all other forms of social media. i then called my phone provider to change my number before driving off.

i texted family members and close friends that we were no longer together and to block him on social media, as well. i didn't tell them why.

i was in a position to end the lease at my apartment early, and i started a new job in a different city later that week.

 i completely removed myself from him and didn't offer a shred of explanation or opportunity for dialogue. i disappeared from his life after his betrayal and i think it'll not only help me to focus on myself without his presence, but i think completely shutting myself off from him will hurt worse than anything when he thinks on how good he had it with me these last 5 years.",11
"i'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so i can forget he exists. i'm not sorry.. i can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. lambast me if you wanr and maybe i even deserve it. i only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. not what you think ""people should"" do. what you would really do. 

i'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. my husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. a very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. i can't see him ever making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. i fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. 

we were told when i was pregnant that he would have downs syndrome. we could handle that. even if it was severe. it turned out he has a chromosome deletion. his disorder is kind of rare so i won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. 

and what he is, is nothing. 

he doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. his eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. he is total care. he is capable of nothing. he is tube fed and on oxygen. he is in diapers and will be forever. he makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. he never even really cried as a baby.

he has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. 

i'm not upset because i got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. i feel the way i feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does nothing. i didn't get an imperfect child. i didn't get *a child*. 

i don't love him. he doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. and yet i'm responsible for him. in addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his g tube, infections, pressure sores no matter what we put him on or how we position him. 

our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. he's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. we do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. i was starting law school, i gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. my older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. 

the final straw was i heard a sound. i went into younger son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw older son hitting him and screaming ""you're why i don't have a mother! you're why i don't have a father! you're why i can't have friends over! you're why i can't be in sports! i didn't ask for you and i hope you die!"" 

instead of being horrified, i watched. and younger son just did. not. react. no signs of pain or fear or upset. no reaction at all. 

he breathes but he is not alive. he doesn't know who i am. he doesn't know who older son is. he has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. 

he doesn't need to be in my home. he doesn't know or care where he is. he is genetically my son but he is not family. my previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". in fact i was looking forward to raising a downs baby. even one with severe impairments, for that reason. with disability can come gifts. this boy is not a gift. he is a genetic mistake i probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if i'd known he would be like this. and the flip side is, if he has awareness..... he's miserable. and there is nothing i can do. if he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. if he is in pain he can't tell anyone. if he wants anything, he can't communicate. he's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. 

and so he's leaving our home on the 29th. i feel excited and relieved and then guilty because i know we'll be happier with him gone. 

he's already taken my husband and my son's father. he was working so so so much ot to pay for the cucumber's care. for the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. because this one was going to be the breakthrough. he was tired and defeated and disappointed. he sought counseling as well but i don't think he could ever say the words ""i don't want my son in my home"" either. 

he's ruined my older son. i was so wrapped up on the younger i never realized how ignored and damaged he was. he lost his father too. i didn't just lose my husband. he is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. at least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. at least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. 

i just want to never think of him again and i'm not sorry. and for that, i'm sorry. 

thanks for reading.

edit: thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. are you a medical doctor? if your google fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. that is the disorder my son has. i've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the pms telling me to kill myself. if you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like downs*. my insurance didn't cover afp testing which would have told us it wasn't downs and i didn't think we needed it. i had a regular ultrasound and a 3d. both drs were ""99% sure it was downs"". 

this post was absolutely not fiction. instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was. 

if anyone would like i'll doxx myself. you can see my id to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. i will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. 

as for not choosing hospice for my son - i can't. about a year ago i myself was hospitalized with severe depression and c-ptsd (there is proof of that too). during that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. i'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. there are competency hearings. there are statements from doctors and evaluations. unless she oks hospice, which she refuses, i cannot decide that. i have custody. i cannot ake medical decisions. she agreed to residential care which i feel is the second best option. so, he's going into residential care. 

as for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, i was downstairs. i couldn't hear what my older son was saying. i only knew he was speaking. go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. they don't cough normally/forcefully. it's more a ""strong puff"". similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. when you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. 

so, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? care to admit i *just might be* telling the truth? there were identify details i left out but guess y'all need them.",11
"i accidentally killed my brother.. throwaway because a lot of people know that this happened to me. i'm going to leave out a lot of detail too just so it can't be easily traced back to me. 

i'm just living with so much guilt. i need to get this out because it's hard to talk about with people that i know. 

when i was 10, i had a little brother who was 2 1/2. we spent a lot of time with our neighbors because our moms were friends and they had 4 kids around the ages of my siblings. one day, we were exploring in the wooded area behind our houses and i found a huge rock. it looked like it had smaller shiny rocks in it (it wound up being a piece of cement with metal shards in it) and i thought it was pretty and wanted to take it home. once we got back to our house though, our mom told us all to pack into the neighbors car as we were going to chuck e cheese. 

the rock was heavy so i brought it with us rather than lugging it home. my neighbors had one of those huge vans that sat like 15 people and had shelves above the seats so i put the rock in one of the selves (and struggled to do so, as it was so heavy). long story short, my baby brother sat below that shelf. at some point when the van stopped, the rock fell out of the shelf and crushed his little head. it wasn't super gory but it was bad enough to have killed him right away. right in front of my mom, me, my brother, sister, and our friends and their mom. at an intersection during a red light. 

i just remember my mom screaming ""where did that come from"" and ""oh god, my baby"" over and over again. it came out as a whisper at first but eventually i was about to choke out an audible ""me"" and i'll never forget the look on my moms face. it was a mixture of pure grief, knowing my brother was dead. anger, because i had done something so dumb that it resulted in the death of her youngest child. and compassion, because i know she wanted to hug me and tell me it wasn't my fault. but she couldn't at that time. she's regretted it for years and has apologized to me over and over but all she said at that moment was ""you killed your brother"". 

i'm 26 now and it's been 16 years since my brother died and i'm still in therapy. my family has assured me every day since that it wasn't my fault and nobody blames me and that's a sweet sentiment but it was still my fault. it was an accident but i still directly caused it. that sweet little baby is dead because of me and i can't escape it. watching my parents grieve like that was unbearable, and they still feel so much pain. 

i just can't stand the pain anymore. my whole life has been a wreck since then and i can't seem to get myself on track. i'm a high school drop out who has to leave work at least once a month because of my severe and constant panic attacks. i have full days where i'm paralyzed and can't get myself out of bed. i feel like i should be dead, and not my brother. 

if you read all of this, thank you. it was hard to write. i just need the universe to know that i haven't forgot what i've done, and i want everyone to know that i'm so sorry. i'll never forgive myself and i'll never forget.

"i kicked my son out of our house for being gay. he became an alcoholic and nearly drank himself to death.. this was in 1991, my son was 18 and going to a local college. me and my wife considered ourselves sort of a normal new jersey italian catholic family, we were traditional and fairly ignorant to most things. we hated the perceived feminization of culture, images of drag queens in nyc and aids and the tight pants of modern kids made us recoil in horror. 

my wife found gay porn magazines in my sons room. i came home to a shit storm, she was freaking out at him, i asked why and she showed me what it was. i felt my heart drop down into my stomach, it was like a punch to the gut. he was *gay*? it felt like the ultimate betrayal to us, betraying our religion, betraying the normal, 'healthy' upbringing we gave him. we had zero concept of the idea of being born gay, we thought it was something you made a choice to engage in, and once you did it you couldn't stop. everything that we had given him, a normal, religious, traditional home, with enough money to go to college and relative freedom to do what he wants, and he just threw it all away. at least, that is what i thought at the time. he was my only precious thing in the world, my son, the person who would inherit my families name, the man who i raised from a child to be a man, but at that moment was the furthest thing from a real man in my mind i could imagine. i made the choice right then and there that he was no son of mine, he was just a sissy bitch who happened to live in my house. 

i know how horrific this sounds, because it was horrific. and it was how almost everyone who lived in our community felt. we were constantly spewed with propaganda to hate gay people and ideas that the youth were all gay and experimenting and getting aids and dressing as women. the hair metal, men wearing makeup, david bowie, the drag queens in new york across the hudson, freddy mercury, the ridiculous clothing of the era, it all gave the worldview that the world was turning into some gay, womanly wonderland. 

anyways, i barely even spoke to him. my wife was the one who did all the yelling. i just went red in the face and couldn't even look at him. she told him to get the fuck out and go to new york to live with his friends, who she assumed were all gay (and she was right, mostly). she physically hit him, a lot, and got him to pack his stuff while he was crying and told him to get out. 

me and my wife were just devastated afterwards, we went to church a lot, my wife told all the other families in the area and they were horrified at my son. i remember when we told our priest, who was a very nice, accepting man, about our son he looked to be disgusted, but when we told him we kicked him out he looked at us in disgust, or at least hided it a tiny bit. living without my son hurt. it also made me rethink things over time. i still saw him almost as a inhuman person, to be gay, to me at that time, was so sinful and horrific that it was impossible to truly consider accepting them as real, normal people. 

me and my wife grew apart in the 6 months following my son leaving. she started to drink a lot, and she was a nasty drunk. she had a history of alcoholism, i knew how bad it could get. this was the worst i had ever seen her. we fought constantly over stupid things, and all i could think about was that when our son was here, we never fought, he always calmed us down. 

in the end, i got kicked out of my own home, she just told me to leave. i moved to new york to live with my brother in bay ridge, we got divorced officially a few months later. she would die from liver failure 7 years later. 

i made the choice, a conscious choice, to find out where my son was. at that point my life was just in shambles and i was rethinking everything about how i viewed my religion, my life, and i was just so horribly depressed and lonely. finding him was a nightmare of itself, it took two weeks of calling homeless shelters and asking around at them if they had seen my son months ago. i finally found him in an apartment in williamsburg. i saw him and apologized, and i told him that i am so sorry i kicked him out. part of me was still in the same mindset as before, i was still a raging homophobe, but i tried to push that part away and just be with my son and ignore everything else. 

he was a severe alcoholic. my first thought when i saw him, sweaty and skinny and sickly looking, was aids. but no, it was alcoholism. it runs in the family. he said that it started soon after i kicked him out, and that he was horribly depressed and turned to drinking heavily. even his roommates said it was a major problem. 

for the next 3 months i spent a lot of time focusing on getting him clean. i met his friends, about half of whom were gay, and we worked together to help him. he went to a detox clinic, he went to rehab. we spent a lot of emotional days together. i didn't want to lose him, even though just a year before i was desperate to get rid of him. the thought of him dying, right after this... because we kicked him out... it was just too much to bear. i made the decision that if he died, i would probably commit suicide after. but he would get clean, then relapse 4 months later, then get clean again for 2 years, then relapse again. then he quickly recovered. and he would never touch another drop again. 

spending that time with my son, and seeing how he lived and more importantly actually seeing how these gay men lived their lives, mostly completely normally, it completely changed me as a human being. in 1996, i went to my first pride parade with my son to support him and his boyfriend at the time. i took a heavy interest in the lgbt community and went with my son to visit his friends in aids clinics. if you were to have told me in 1991 that i would be going to an aids clinic with a drag queen and being friendly with everyone by 1997, i wouldn't believe you in the slightest. 

anyways this post has been days in the making. i love reddit even if i am a bit old for it haha. i have told my story before to a journalist and it was published. if you feel deja vu reading this, i would very much prefer if you didn't reveal my identity on this post or post the article.

"cop pulled me over and i called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail.. when i was 19 i was running late to work in my tiny pos economy car and on fumes of gas i didn't come to a complete stop on a right turn. lights behind me so i pull over. i know i've barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why i rolled through the stop a little. trying not to have the car die. 

at the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called voicesteam (now tmoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. they were the first phones with caller id and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn't be triangulated or traced. not that i cared but it stuck in my mind. 

well as i give the cop my license, registration and insurance card i got an idea. i knew if i was late to work i was going to lose my job. they were super strict there. 

so i get an idea and right after i hand the papers to the cop and he's walking back to his cruiser i called 911 and tell the operator i just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. i confirmed the address then i hung up. 

about 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, ""come to a complete stop next time!!"" then peels off to the direction of the store. 

pushed my car to the gas station that i'd almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. 

i was an idiot and i confess!

edit: wow, this blew up.  i forgot to mention i would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because i was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and i had a bench warrant for it.  because i'm an idiot!

so it wouldn't have been just a few mins late to work. the job was a physical high turn over one that didn't tolerate much.

thank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards!  don't think i deserve them but i'll pass it along to those who do!",11
"i used to bully my disabled brother for years. update:

a lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.

i wrote up a long ass apology letter that i wanted to read to my brother. i waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.

i knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. i couldn't even get through the first few words. i started crying after saying ""i wanted to say i'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.

i just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. he hugged me really tight and said ""i missed you buddy"".

i fucking lost it. i never cried that bad before. he just hugged me for a long time until i calmed down. we didn't talk much. he started crying for a bit too. it was the first time in a long time we just hugged. after half an hour i got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. why didn't i do this earlier, fuck.

i thought i could i try apologizing properly again tomorrow. i left him the note to read anyway.

i am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. i swear to god and on my own life i will never treat my brother so badly again.

i have been working part-time for the past year and i was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. but i think i will take my brother myself instead (when i turn 18).

i also realized that i need to have a relationship with my brother where i am not just taking care of him. it needs to be like a normal brother relationship. like going for movies and stuff. it's going to take some time for me to fix the mess i created though. i'm just lucky my brother is amazing.

i received a lot of messages. i appreciate everyone for their input and i did read them all even if i didn't reply. thanks everyone.




my actual post:

remorse


i know this will get a lot of hate and yes i deserve it. i am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. i know i am a piece of human trash.

i just need to get this out.

i have a brother who is two years older then me. he has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. he cannot use his arms that well either.

we used to have a great relationship until i turned 11 and i really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. and how much stress he put them under.

i had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. i hated it.

there was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.

i realize now that i had no right to judge him and i will never know how difficult life is for him.

i stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. i would tell my family all the fun i was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.

i started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. he would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.

it started escalating two years ago when i would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.

i would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the dvr. i would make fun of his speech. push things just out of his reach.

i would act disgusted when i had to change or bathe him. it always made him feel bad and he would apologize. i made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. what the fuck is wrong with me?

but my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. and he never let me have it.

three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and i was just ignoring him. i got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. i fell asleep and realized i left him out there for three hours.

when i went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. he was humiliated. 

i have always felt guilty about how i treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. but seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.

i stopped all the bullying after that day. i couldn't even look him in the face i was so ashamed.

last sunday my brother told me he was glad i was his brother and friend. i couldn't even respond. i went to my room and cried.

i'm fucking crying again typing this all out. when did i become an evil trash human being? fuck.

i'm 17 and he's 19 now. i know there is nothing i can do to make up for the past 6 years.

my brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. i'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. i want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.

i am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. i am so ashamed of myself.",11

just did bullet form for brevity 

got a new job about three months ago from a competitor of my old employer. decent pay increase as a project manager, fortune 300

when getting hired, was told my team was getting assembled, and was given some prelim work to do but was warned it may be a week or two. cool with me, got me time to get acclimated

i complete the work a lot sooner than expected, and, after asking my boss if there was anything to do and being told ""not yet"" sit on my thumbs for a few days, assuming hr will be in touch with the status of the hires

about a month goes by, and still nothing. i try to be helpful, e-mailing other managers asking if they needed a second eye on anything, and asking my boss/a few people under me if they need help on any projects, yet no long term goal can be found and for the most part i essentially do nothing but play on my phone and day trade. (i have my own office).

i check in weekly with a member of hr, alternating between a few as to not piss them off, but hear little back.

eventually, my boss retires, and the new interim guy is from another department, i'm friendly with him, but its clear he's a bit over his head, so i figured i'd wait a few days to let him know my situation. eventually though, he comes into my office to ""thank me"" for doing good work on the initial pre setup i had done a month ago. after that, he essentially leaves me to my own devices. at this point, i had written close to a dozen e-mails to hr, and even my bosses boss, but always got non committal responses. eventually due to learned response i kind of give up and just figure someone will tell me eventually.

it's now been close to three months and outside of extremely minor favor tasks and my initial pre planning, i've essentially done nothing, and have not been asked what i'm doing once. i occasionally walk around the production floor with a clipboard taking notes so i'm seen, but i seriously feel like even if i didn't no one would notice. my new boss doesn't seem to realize i'm one of his workers, and essentially leaves me alone, lost in the shuffle of a huge company.

a bit annoying, but i'm not complaining and i have documented proof of me trying to fix this situation. until someone notices though, i'm happy playing words with friends and day trading while getting 35 an hour",11

"i've been replacing my wife's coffee with decaf for 4 years. my wife and i have been married for 4 years.

when we met she was a tiny little terror. like the tasmanian devil had a baby with barbie. so freaking adorable and sweet, but she was a tornado. she drank like 6 cups of coffee every single day. so much caffeine for a tiny person. if you didn't know her you would swear she was on drugs. i loved her so much that i knew i could put up with it if i had to, but if i didn't have to, i would try to find a way. so the month before our wedding i decided to try replacing her coffee with decaf for to see if it made a change. and lord have mercy, it was incredible. it was hell the first two weeks. she had the biggest attitude and was so crabby, but i knew we could make it through it. afterwards it was the best! she was still sweet, and spunky, and adorable, but she wasn't leaving a trail of destruction behind her anymore. i was amazed! so i decided that from that moment on, i would no longer supply her with regular coffee. i would make every starbucks run, i would buy regular and decaf ground coffee so i could replace the regular coffee in the package with decaf coffee. the only time she has regular coffee is when she orders it herself, which is like maybe once a week. but it makes her really jittery and she doesn't understand why. it's been this way for 4 years. she has no idea, and i am hoping to keep it that way. we are talking about having kids in the next year or so, so i'm hoping that i can convince her to go full decaf on her own at that time and then i won't have to keep this up anymore.",11

the way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. so if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. my manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. 

so my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when i was closing i found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. they were filled with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. so, i scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. after we closed, i came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. i counted them. there were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. none of them had expiration dates. total haul was $40k in fast food certificates. 
my manager never said a word, he couldn't. he had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. 

over the next three years my girlfriend and i toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. we never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. 

after the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. 

i bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
and for some reason a kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. we threw away a lot of kiddie cones. 

edit:

holy crap this blew up.  here are the answers to some of the faqs

1. we could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.  


2. the only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.  


3. the manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.  


4. each gift certificate had a generic plu on them.  e.i. all the $25 were plu #756.

5.  when we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  they were not coupons.  

6.  one can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",11
i thought i was a pretty good dad until i was tested. my son threw a snowball at me and i instinctively blocked it with my daughter. the look of betrayal on her snow covered face has haunted my dreams for years,11
"my son beat up another boy and i'm so proud of him.. so my son was being bullied pretty badly at school. people would make fun of his accent, use racial slurs towards him, throw open milk cartons at him at lunch, start rumors about him, they put his book bag in the toilet once, and a bunch of fucked shit kids do to each other. my son had told on the main perpetrator to me and his mother and i went to the school and told them about my concerns and the school gave him a stern talking to which only stopped him for a few weeks and then he continued to bully my son. so i went to the school and complained again and the administration had told me that they spoke to the kid and he had told them that he was just joking and he didnt mean any of the stuff he was saying and that they were actually friends anyway the assistant principal told me that ""boys will be boys"" and that it was not out of the ordinary for boys to make fun of each other, but since the kid had admitted to doing it they gave him in-school suspension which is essentially a slap on the wrist. so after that i realized that nothing was going to happen if i kept running back to the administration every time my son came home crying so i took matters into my own hands. (now im going to tell you something about me. in my home country i was an amateur boxer but due to the financial situation i was in, my mother did not want me to box she wanted me to work and study, so i cut a deal with her if i made that if to the olympics i would go pro after but if i failed i would stop and work and go to university. anyway i failed and stopped boxing and got a job and finished my studies.) ok so what i did was taught my son how to fight. everyday after i get home from work for the past 9 months i take him to the local boxing gym and taught him how to hit the bag, throw combinations, taught him about foot work and movement, how to work the speed bag, how to dodge, hit the pads and everything i else i knew from my old days as a boxer. it worked wonders for my son not only did he become physically stronger, he also became mentally strong, he stopped coming home crying, he started to make friends and it had a real positive effect on him. when i would ask him if he was still getting bullied he said it didnt bother him what people he didnt care about said about him, so i figured that was the end of the bully problem, i was wrong. two weeks ago i get a call from school that my son had gotten into a fight and that i had to go pick him up because he and the other boy were both suspended for 5 days for fighting. when i go to pick my son up he is covered in blood, which was alarming at first but then he told me that it was not his blood it was the other boy, the one who put his bag in the toilet kept walking up to him and using racial insults towards him and my son told him if he didnt stop he was going to beat him up, and he kept his promise. turns out my son broke the other kids nose, busted his lip and hit the other kids eye and it had swollen shut. my son has some bruises on his face but nothing compared to the other kid. now my son has been getting yelled at alot by his mother, she made him write and apology letter to the boy, the boys parents, to the principal, to the teacher, to the security guard who broke it up and she is really mad at me and blames me for this because i taught him how to fight but i honestly could not be more proud of him. he's getting whatever he wants for christmas from me. sorry for the horrible grammar english is not my first language. no regrets",11
"ive been on the run for 7 and a half years.. i stopped reporting to my parole officer in 2011. i recently had a beautiful baby. tomorrow i'm turning myself in. can't be a father if i'm a wanted man. i have 12 years hanging over my head. i've never experienced abject terror before today. i'll never be able to say that sentence again. i'm not even sure why i'm posting. i have a great support network, but i'm still terrified. of the consequences. of losing everything. of missing the beginning of my child's life. i don't fear prison. prison is actually the easiest part of all this. when i went to prison the first time, i just didn't care. now i have everything to lose. i'm stepping off a cliff with no idea where i'll land...

edit: there has been concern that i'm going to prison for 12 years. for clarity 12 years is how much parole i have left. under state law 6 is the max i can receive. more likely it will be 1-3 based on several factors. no new charges, turning myself in, new child.

i commented this but wanted to post it up top so people would see them. 

jesus christ on a motorbike i didn't expect this to blow up the way it did.

first i want to address the ""you deserve what you get"" and ""you're a terrible person"" crowd. trust me. i'm more aware of those facts than you could ever be. i was a coward. until i walk through those doors tomorrow, i still am a coward. i am a piece of shit. but with the family and friends i have on my side, i won't be for long.

for all the folks wishing me luck, sending me messages, and generally showing empathy to a man undeserving: thank you from every piece of my heart. sometimes the internet's not such a bad place.

as for updates. my brother has expressed that he is willing to post them from this account over the next few weeks as the process works itself out. so it won't be me directly, but they'll be here.

finally. to answer a couple common questions:

1. ""how did you make it seven years?"" i didn't break the law, kept my head down, and was, for all intents and purposes, barring the absconding, a model citizen. no one ever had a reason to question me.

2. ""why not stay on the run?"" this may be hard for someone on the outside to understand, but the life i currently live is a life of constant fear. a purgatory. a half life. my daughter has made me see that i need more. i need freedom. which may seem contrary to going to prison, but jail or prison is just the first step in a longer game plan. one that sees me as a real model citizen, the best father i can be, and lord willing, the best husband a woman could hope for.

3. ""what were your crimes?"" like i've mentioned, i am actively avoiding specificity, but the long and short is i committed several crimes over several weeks, and it culminated in me fighting a cop and hurting him when he tried to arrest me.

4. ""have you ever talked to the cop and apologized?"" i have not. i hope to one day, but first thing first is getting my shit together. an apology from an on the run convicted criminal doesn't mean much.

5. ""what about your wife/woman?"" i am hopeful. she seems committed to helping me through this. i hope to make us work. but if time has other plans she will always have my love and respect. both as the mother of my child and the woman who helped me to grow into the kind of man that's ready to face his failures and grow as a human, and a parent.

that's all i got for now. i might add a final note before i go in tomorrow. if not my brother will update when new news is to be had.

update: this is my final update for a while. in 20 minutes my attorney is driving me to county. i'm currently holding my daughter while my lady hammers out some details with the lawyer. thank you all for the well wishes. as strange as it is reddit has given me more of the strength i need to do this. the internet sometimes comes through for you. excuse me for now. i need to cuddle my daughter for the last few minutes i can...",11
"i regret having my child. throwaway for obvious reasons.

i was married for 15 years to my high school sweetheart.  we had two beautiful kids (13 & 9).  for many reasons, we divorced.

skip to me starting to date again a year later.  i meet an amazing woman almost right away (first month of dating again).  we have a ton in common.  we fall in love very quickly.  she tells me early on that she wants kids.  i had never wanted more kids.  two was more than enough for me.  i had even made an appointment to get snipped later that year.  but this woman is perfect for me, and having kids is a dealbreaker for her.  so i decide i could do this all again - for her, for us.  

i'm approaching 40 when we finally start trying.  due to some health complications (she's over 35, and has high blood pressure), we ended up having to do ivf.  it worked, and we were pregnant soon afterwards.  but...

our son was born prematurely (they warned us this was a possibility due to her age/health).  he had to stay in the nicu for three months.  my new wife developed post partum due to the stress.  we found out our son had cerebral palsy.  a milder form, but he had it.  our world shifted from being a happy couple with a new baby to a depressed and stressed couple dealing with a child that has a life long disability.  this is not how i perceived my second chance at happiness was going to be.

i won't leave my wife.  and i will love and take care of our son forever.  but not a day goes by where i don't regret my decision to have more kids.  i should have listened to my gut from the beginning and called off the relationship early on.  she wanted kids, and i didn't.   but i did this for her.  now i'm depressed, financially strained, and my future isn't the relaxing one i pictured.  i can never tell my wife this of course.  and i feel bad even writing this to you all of you.  but i just needed to get it out.

edit:  thank you for the gold.  i'm humbled.",11
"i overcharged over 5,000 people.. back in high school i used to work the concession stand. in my school the booth was a little folding table where i would sell water, pop and chips. 

to anyone that was a visiting team i would charge $.25-.50 more on the items they wanted to buy, and i would keep it. 

i ended up making somewhere around $3,000 doing this for my high school career, and no one ever found out because i didn't charge anyone from the home team the same amount. ",11
"confession: i'm on the internet right now. i'm born, brought up and live in a cult so this is confession worthy.. i'm supposed to be posting and marketing products the sect makes online, and one of my mothers checks the search history nightly, but everyone is too dumbed down to realize that incognito is a thing. so when everyone is gone doing work and i'm made to post the listings on the internet, i will go on incognito and browse reddit and world news and twitter feeds and whatever else. 

i'm 19. 

if they found out i would definitely not be left with so much freedom and i'd be punished, yeah. even if i'm now a adult by the governments order, i'm still pushed in the group of being a child, so i'd probably get a serious beating.

i'm actually really lonely and empty all of the time. for the people who post their information and pictures and lifes on reddit, you really do a lot for me and it helps me get through these days.

thank you so much

"i slept with my daughters ex boyfriend, he got me pregnant and i had an abortion. they got back together and got married.. this was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? i was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating harry, who was 24. i was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. i was not a good person, let alone mother. not like i was abusive to my daughter or anything but i was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. i am 14 years sober now. 

i disproved of my daughter dating harry, but i never told her why. he would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. she broke up with him over his alcoholism. 

soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, i turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and i couldn't resist. he came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. he was a very good looking guy. he looked a lot like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. 

for the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. 

then i got pregnant. i knew it was by him, i had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. i never told him i was pregnant, and i went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. 

anyways, i stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. i also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with harry, and that he is fully sober. i was mortified honestly. he was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. they came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. i agreed. 

its been 16 years of marriage on their part. they have a kid together. harry got cancer, then beat it. i got sober. that's basically it. 

i don't see them very often, they live in texas and i live on the east coast. but whenever i do there is always that tension between me and harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, i can just tell. not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? what the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension. 

i think about this often. especially when i see my grandson. i always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but wow what a disaster that would have been if i decided to keep that child. ",11
"i killed an elderly man in front of his wife and basically his entire family.. forgive me for any misspellings or format i'm trying to do this on my phone.  i haven't talked about this to anyone (even though it's been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.

one nite when i was in college i was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.

i was taking a street i was very familiar with to get back to my house.  it was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  i remember that i looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  but when i looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.

i didn't have any time to react, by the time i saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  i remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  i'll admit i had thought about speeding away, but i pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.

when i got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  he has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  all i could say was ""i didn't see him"" i was frantic by the time it had set in what i had done.

i sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  i sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  i don't believe i've ever cried so hard and for so long.  the worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while i was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said ""i was married to him for almost 50 years.  we had a good life."" then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.


  after everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  i wasn't charged with anything and i had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  i went down a dark path the years after that.  i drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because i couldn't hold on to a job.  even tried to kill myself with pills.  it was a hard road to recovery (witch i feel i'm not fully recovered from nor do i feel i ever will be the same). but eventually i got my life back in order.  joined up with the navy and saw a bit of the world, and now i'm on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what i started there.   it took almost a decade but i finally start to feel almost whole again.  i'm back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  so maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

wow, you guys are awesome! thanks for the support and feedback.  i've never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. thank you!
and big thanks to whoever reformatted my post.  i'm shit at this so thanks homie!",11
"found out my dead best friend was in love with my wife. light

i'm writing this as a confession because i don't know where else to speak about this and i don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.

my friend died a few months back due to heart problems. he was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.

he had some boxes in his basement and after a while i started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. i found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. that was enough to make me feel bad and i just got back to taping them up. 

but one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so i decided to check it in case it was something important. to my surprise i found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. the most recent being from my wife's birthday party. 

alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. the first one dated 2 months before i met her. the last one was also the same date of her birthday party. there was one that stood out the most was one from after i started dating her. he wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.

i'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",11
"i'm the guy stealing your ashtray off your porch every couple nights.. throwaway because a lot of people know my real reddit.

for the past 3 months i have hit a rough patch. barely making my rent which is $480 a week, barely making my bills. can barely afford cigarettes. (cigarettes in australia cost roughly $25 for a pack of 20's)

a neighbour of mine is an outdoor smoker, he lives in an apartment building just a block away. he has been filling large jars up with his cigarette butts and keeping them in the jar at his front door, the first time i stole it the next day he had already put out an identical jar, i let that fill up for a few days and then i stole that one too. this repeated two more times.

the fifth jar he put out, funny enough literally the next day. was also identical except this one had the message ""please bring back jar :)"" a lot of people would be disgusted that someone is stealing their ashtray but whoever lives in this house obviously knows what it means to be broke.

i listened to whoever it was and after i stole the ashtray with the message on it, i grabbed all the jars i had from my his house and brought them back to his doorstep. ever since then, he has been leaving me half cigarettes in the ashtray, our routine is, he smokes, fills it up, i take it home, and bring back the jar i had taken recently.

it's literally now a whole system.... two jars constantly in rotation between us both. and we have never even met each other, or seen each other before.

tl;dr: starting stealing ashtrays off my neighbour, now we have a whole system together where he supplies half cigarettes for me every couple days.

edit: i wrote a long note including the link to this reddit post and put it in one of his ashtrays and put it outside his doorstep. its nearly 4am in melbourne so it was perfect timing.",11
"once a year i book a lodge out in the middle of nowhere and take lsd despite having schizophrenia.. every year at the start of november i book a lodge in the middle of nowhere for a week. i am 32 years old and have schizophrenia and have done this for the past 6 years. i'm on treatment (medication and therapy) all year except the 3 days leading up to my adventure and for the week itself. i do this without anybody knowing because i know i'd get a lecture which i completely understand why. usually my psychosis and break from reality is very negative and scary that's why i comply with medication on the most part. but every time i've taken lsd i've had nothing but fantastic, intriguing and amazing experiences. i love taking it and stepping into a different reality not the reality i live in or the reality i face when psychotic, a reality where everything is beautiful and bliss. the things i take back from these experiences has helped me so much. obviously i understand the risks of taking lsd as a schizophrenic, on my trip i'm sure to bring high dose antipsychotics and sedatives if i ever need to use them. but when i take the drug i find myself in a place like no other, everything has meaning and beauty. colours and wildlife are fascinating to look at. the adventures that happen are incredible, i really find my true self and are content with life. i'll never tell anybody i know about this because they wouldn't understand and i'll never share the experience with anybody else because this is really a time to find me and experience paradise.",11

yesterday he destroyed his group project, causing everyone in his group to fail. (although i'm giving more time for the rest of his group to re-make all of their lost work)

the kid got roughed up and had to go home early while every soul at the class is silent shut about any ""suspects"" but i believe that everyone in the class knew about this for some time now.

"my aunt hit my mother so i dragged her across the floor and punched her till she passed out. my aunt is a poisonous woman. our whole family doesn't talk to her. she's done things in the past you wouldn't believe. so she left our lives years ago. recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. my mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. my mom and aunt never got on. my mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. 

my aunt was nasty and would hurt people's feeling intentionally for no reason. she never had a partner or kids. she isolated herself from everyone. my gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. we all genuinely think there's something physiologically wrong with her. 

so back to where i was going with this....one morning i was at my moms house. just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. so i opened it and there she was. she walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. she looked dead behind the eyes. i tried to stop her but she pushed me down. i honestly don't know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. i quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn't even have a chance to blink before she hit her. she went down like a ton of bricks.

my heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when i seen it. something came over me, i don't know if it was anger or adrenaline, but i ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and i dragged her out onto the back lawn and i bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. thankfully no one seen me or i might not of been writing this right now. i got up and i left her there. i went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. i looked back out the window and she was gone. 

we told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. i'm still so hurt and angry as i write this. but i also feel tremendously guilty and upset that i done that to her because i've never fought anyone and i'm not a fighter at all, but something came over me and i snapped. 

i can't get over it for some reason. it just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. god forbid she had a weapon that's truly scary to think about. we didn't call the police. as i assaulted her badly and didn't want it to bounce back on me. that's another thing i feel ashamed about.

but should i feel bad or not? i need others opinions as i've been bottling this up for a while.  

my gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. you can't help someone who doesn't want to be saved. ",11

"i gave a lactose intolerant customer dairy on purpose. i know this sounds weird but when i worked at starbucks, there was a regular customer that was very difficult and rude. i was warned of this customer on my first day of training. she came in every morning and would try to rush the workers on doing their job and makes other customers feel uncomfortable. 3 months into working, she came in one morning and caused absolute hell. she was complaining about her drink while one of my coworkers was making the drink. as soon as she got it she accidentally ""spills"" it and asks for a completely different drink. i was so fed up. she wanted a frappuccino. she went to the bathroom while we were making the new order. i switched with my coworker and made the drink. instead of almond milk i made the frappuccino with regular milk. the drink was ready by the time she left the bathroom. she takes the drink and takes a sip and didn't complain. 5 hours later she calls the starbucks from the hospital and i was the one who picked up. she got in a car accident trying to rush to a bathroom. she said she shitted her pants. i couldn't be anymore happier that she was safe but got her karma.",11
"i held my boyfriend at gunpoint over a 8 hour period. i wanted to pull the trigger.. i was not in a good mental spot. it wasn't some big epic fight that started it. we had a disagreement and i flipped. i didn't black out, i was fully aware of my actions.

we were in a happy relationship, at that point 3 years in. i woke up one day and we had a little arguement over something i don't even remember now. he tried walking away to let me cool off and i lost it. i grabbed my gun, told him we were going to talk. i loaded it and held him at gunpoint in our bedroom for about 8 hours. i had never been violent before, no warning signs etc. he talked me out of it and instead of calling the police he got me the help i needed through medical professionals. 

i was diagnosed with ptsd, social anxiety and depression (possible stemming from the ptsd). 

he was there for me every step of the way, and the guilt i feel will never go away from my actions. life could of gone such a different way if i pulled the trigger. this was 10 years ago, and we are married and have 2 beautiful children. looking at us now, no one would imagine what happened. we never told anyone, and he stood by me at my darkest moment. 

mental health problems are real. instead of locking me away, and running for the hills he helped me when i needed it the most. the resulting life we are living together is more then i could have ever imagined. ",11
"i used to steal tons of food from my old job by pretending to be a customer ordering food and then calling 30 minutes later asking to cancel it. i used to work at this restaurant and the management there was just awful and the gm was just very verbally abusive. she always would complain about everything and one thing specifically was how there would be 1 or 2 customers who would order food and then never show up, she ended up letting the servers and hosts eat the food. so it gave me an idea. 
one day she said something that really pissed me off, so i called my job and ordered a bunch of food under a different name and then that ""customer"" would never show up. it made her livid and it gave me the bold idea of doing that whenever i want a lunch. i started to do it an hour or so before my break and i would order whatever i felt like eating that day and when they'd call and cancel i'd ask a supervisor if i could have the food and they'd say sure. 
i did this for the entire 3 years that i worked there 2 times a week, sometimes even 3. i didn't ever get caught , and i've even had a coworker help me by being the one to answer the phone. it was kinda funny and that place was awful, so i kinda deserved it.

edit: i should also add that this was a chain restaurant worth millions of dollars. i would never do something like this to a small or family owned restaurant. also i know i'm wrong for stealing, i was 16 and was trying to piss off my gm for the time i was there.",11
"after 13 years clean and 8 years of marriage, i did heroin 3 weeks ago and almost came close to fully relapsing.. i was a heroin addict in the lower east side of manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. i got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. i got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. she knows i was an addict. 

i spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. it had been *so long*. i still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 

3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. he is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. 

i got drunk, really drunk. i hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. there was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. i don't even fully remember what happened, i just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. i spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. i had 10 missed calls. 

i panicked when i came out of my daze. i told my wife i had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so i stayed at charlies house. she was disappointed i didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. this was a ""i told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before i went to the bar. she wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in massachusetts. 

i spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (i dont even know what to call them). it was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when i first was an addict. not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what i was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. i wanted to fucking get more so badly. i left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, i gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. i still thank fucking god i did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. i would have absolutely done it. 

i feel like everything i thought about myself, that i was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that i had beat heroin... it was all gone. i am not going to say i am back at square one or anything, i am not. but i feel like something inside of me has reset. my unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. i still am weak. heroin is so, so much stronger than me. its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. 

when i was young, my aunt had cancer. she beat it. then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. it didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. she lived with us. i remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. i remember her feelings and how she felt about it. so many years after she thought it had gone away. 

that is how i feel. like a cancer which i thought i got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. 

the first 5-6 days after i tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. my kids and wife have come back. the urges mostly went away the second i saw my kids. i hugged them so damn hard. 

and i never told my family what happened, nor will i ever. my wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after i was clean. i just cannot have her know, ever. 

i won't do it again. i am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. i mean, not like i want to get drunk again like that, but just in case i ever want to get loose? i am never doing that in the city again. 

i am still about 90%+ sure that i won't ever touch heroin again. i am still positive in myself about it. its just... it used to be 99% sure. that is what fucking terrifies me. 

i said heroin is stronger than me. it is absolutely stronger than me. but the reason i won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. i don't care about how good it feels, i will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. i would rather just kill myself than that.

"8 years ago i caused a ufo panic. one college summer break 8 years ago my friends and i were bored. we remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""solar balloon"". this was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. the sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.  
  
we had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. we spent a few days driving around to walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. after sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!  
  
this is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.(https://imgur.com/1kmebpm)
  
we had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
   
shortly after this the balloon got away from us(https://imgur.com/ejipkfq)  
further(https://imgur.com/a/ruoxwch)  
  
this was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. oh well, mission success.  
  
a few years later i happened across this news article(https://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/05/look_up_in_the_sky_its_a_large.html). the balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big ufo panic. people were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. our boredom unintentionally created a ufo panic in central nj. i moved out of the area but when i get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.  
  

edit: wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. also didn't expect any nj redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose.

"i faked my resume and now i'm in the shit........... throwaway account for obvious reasons. since i started high school, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when i got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as i majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. well basically what happened was that i failed my first year and had to switch my major. i didn't tell them and they didn't ask so i thought as long as i got my shit together and not drop out i'll be fine. one day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. i panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the gpa and major and made up some shit and thought i saved myself. welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. so i am fucked. they'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and i'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and i have to live with the guilt that i got a job that i didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and i'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. i feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now i'm on the verge of being blown and i thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but i honestly don't know.

"i snooped on the ceo's email account and got myself unfired. a couple years out of college i worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. the ceo was one of the biggest assholes i've ever met. he was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. he'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...i even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.

anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), i also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. so like many of my generation, i became the defacto ""millenial office computer guy"" too. despite my lack of qualifications i got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""how do i convert this to pdf"" questions...even basic network security. they thought i was some sort of computer genius...but really i was just mostly winging it, googling pretty much everything.

but eventually i got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. they gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. i didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.

after a couple years of serious bullshit working there, i was pretty worn out. i wasn't progressing. i hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. i was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. and they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. i also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. so i decided i full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and i would start my own consulting business working for myself.

however, instead of quitting right away, i figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while i was still getting a steady paycheck. so thats what i did. i launched my company, and landed my first clients.

as the workload increased, i slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. at first i was pretty low key about it. but eventually, it was blatant. as it was a super small company....i was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. it was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that i actually finished in 10 minutes.

pretty soon i was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. i'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. the rest of the time i was usually dicking around on reddit or something. of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. but i was the person in charge of monitoring it.

this continued for a while. as my own business ramped up, i cared less and less about the office job. and since i hated waking up early, i began rolling into work late. at first it was only 30 minutes or so. then it progressed to an hour. when my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. i took full advantage of this. before long i was arriving around noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. 

my coworkers werent happy, but i helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. my boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but i just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever i wanted.

after more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, i couldn't believe i wasn't fired yet. i deserved it and felt it was inevitable.

on a hunch, i decided to do a little investigative work. as i was the ""tech guy"", i also had full access to the company email server. so i logged into the ceo's personal email account, and searched for my name. lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. obviously i open it. they're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""if nobody has any objections, i will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.

i wasn't surprised, but i decided there was no way i was going to let these assholes fire me. although i didn't give a shit about that job, i didn't want to have a termination in my work history. i also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. of course, i couldn't let him know i actually knew i was getting canned. so, i formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the ceo.

the next day, one day before they planned to fire me, i requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". in that meeting i sat down, and he asked me what i wanted to talk about. so i told him (paraphrased): ""look, i know i've been a shitty employee lately. i'm sure you've noticed. correct me if i'm wrong, but i've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" when i said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought i was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. i remember him just saying something like ""uhh"". i continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""so i'll be honest with you, my heart isn't in this job anymore. as you know, i'm an entrepreneur at heart...which i'm sure you can relate to. i want to start my own company. however, as you're aware, i have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" i then proceeded to list all of the things i did and projects i was working on. i could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if i left suddenly.

""so here's what i propose. you don't fire me. i don't quit. i keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything i'm in charge of. after a month is up, i will continue to come in once per week until its complete. after that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".   

i intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though i technically had him by the balls. 

he paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""okay. you have a deal"".  

so, not only did i get myself unfired...i actually turned the company into a paying client. during that month, i continued doing pretty much whatever i wanted since i had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). after the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . i charged them triple what i was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the ceo.  my client base was big enough i dropped them for good.

...after all that, the ceo still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. these days i just blow him off saying ""sorry, i'm too busy"".

**edit:** as it seems there's some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured i'd clarify a few points.

1) this was a very small company. the office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. if you've never worked in a small office before, i can assure you it's pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. it's also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 

2) i did not become some ""computer genius"" and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). i had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years i was there. for anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside it consultants. but i was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. and i just handled more basic tasks myself . we're also not talking about enterprise level security here either

3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. im not going to reveal exactly what i do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it's in marketing. i didn't steal any of my old company's clients when i left and don't compete with them**

4) yes, im fully aware and admit i was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. in fact i decided to start my own company because i hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. i'm not a great employee when i don't care about what i'm doing. however, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and i did not feel that bad about it at the time. 
  
      the thing i did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. i do not condoned invading privacy like that. however, he'd freely given me the passwords (so i could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and i felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon. ",11

"for three years, i switched my partner's tea in the morning because i couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.. when my ex and i started dating, i used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. it's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. so, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. my ex however had to have a very specific ritual: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than fortnum & mason's royal blend.

so, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, i entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he would always thank me and tell me that i make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, i couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with pg tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? tea is tea after all. so, i used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. i was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was thompsons punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, i finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. i would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it.

when we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that i was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so i had to be a bit more clever. at the time, i was studying at college so i was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. i used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. when it came to making his in the morning, i would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and i used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. he would always comment that i run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. this went on for a couple of years and i never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? it was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. i never let him make a cup of tea unless i was away so he never really had to find out. 

after we split up, we remained good friends and i've spent some time with him too in our old flat. every time i visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way i used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way i did"". he even says that when he makes it himself with punjana that he could never make it taste right and that i was some sort of special tea maker. i still haven't told him.

this is a long post about tea so the tldr: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, i switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",11

edit 2: wow was not expecting this to blow up. for those of you saying i need help, trust me i get that. i was in a very dark place at the time. and i was very drunk while doing all of this. i ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. my life has immensely changed for the better and i handle things way better now!

edit 3: for those of you wondering why i ""let the ex off easy""- honestly i should have guessed he wasn't that into me. i just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. i got myself into that situation. it was a really rough time and i had literally 0 self respect. what really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. i did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn't get off easy that's for sure. but at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that i lost my best friend.

"when i nannied i would read the journal of the mom.. i was only 20 years old and i nannied for this little baby boy. the mom seemed off. she would sleep the entire time i was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. one time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- i was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating mcdonald's and watching her show. she did not say a word to me the entire time. 

well, one day when she was out i snooped around and found her journal- i read the whole thing. then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life.

i ended up working for her for three years and we became close. but that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. in retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression.

edit: thanks everyone for the positive comments; i honestly was not expecting that- i just wanted to confess. for those of you who think i'm a horrible person for doing this, that's ok. it was over 15 years ago and it still weighs on my mind that i invaded someone's privacy. i felt bad about it then which is why i tried to repay by helping, but yes i did invade someone's privacy and that's not cool, i'm certainly not saying what i did was ok. hence, the confession...

also, as a 20 year old with no concept of the hardships of having kids i didn't understand why she was acting the way she was; i get it now.",11
"i found my brothers suicide note on reddit and didn't tell anyone.. throwaway account.

remorse

when i was around 14 or 15 i found my older brothers reddit account because of a secret santa package that got sent to us. i of course wanted to snoop onto his account so i checked his history, and found all of his posts for the past month had been been to /r/depression 

one post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. that was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. he mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. i was obscenely scared when i found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that i found this. to this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. the only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. i feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and i feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all.

i just want to thank whoever dissuaded my brother from commiting suicide that day. he doesn't know how much of a positive impact he's had on my life, and you kept him around so he could further that impact.",11
"i call fake orders in to a pizza place to get free pizzas.. my husband works at a popular pizza chain. we'll call it ""piece of butt"" for the sake of rhyming.
 if orders are messed up or carry out orders don't show, the employees get to take the food home. sometimes i order pizzas under fake names and give the numbers of local businesses as callback numbers, and then purposefully never show up to pay for it. 9 times out of 10 my husband brings home the pizza i ordered. this is sinful pizza, yes i know. but sin pizza tastes better than honest pizza, inexplicably.

edit:
wow, guys! i'm glad so many people found this entertaining. i'm glad to put a smile on anonymous internet faces. thanks for the gold and silver. my first gold! 
for those who say i am a ""pizza shit,"" why yes, yes i am. especially since i can afford to buy the pizza.. i hope i don't put peice of butt out of business, i'd feel so bad since they've treated my husband *so well* as an employee..
for those who went through my post history and want to report this to the school i work at: please. do it. my boss could use a laugh. 
for those who immediately messaged me about my divorce/ being single now: you must at least work at papa john's or better, and maybe i'll consider you. papa bless y'all.

"my brother beat me up so i ruined his relationship. no regrets

my brother and i have a very bad relationship, there's a lot of yelling and cussing but we never got phisycal until one night he came home very angry and just started punching and kicking me. our parents weren't home so i guess that's why he felt brave. i ended up with a busted lip, a black eye and a bunch of bruises all over my body. after that our father sent him away for a while. a few days later i used my mom's phone to ""accidentally"" call his girlfriend and left it on while i talked to my mom how worried i was that he was capable to beat up his little sister, imagine what he could do to his girlfriend.

the next day the girl showed up at our house saying that she wanted to hang out with the family, which was really weird because she would only do that when my brother was at home.  but when she saw me she started freaking out asking what had happened and if it had anything to do with my brother. my mom ended up telling her and she dumped him the same day.

"buried money in the sand so dad could find it with his metal detector. dad bought himself a metal detector because we've been going to the beach quite alot, and he wanted to see what he could find. 
well one day he set his detector up, walked to the beach and went on his way to bag himself some gnarly trinkets. he'd been doing it for about 20 minutes at this point and nothing came of it but we were nearing the end of that section of beach. he looked more and more disappointed with every step he took, so i walked ahead and discreetly placed £7 worth of coinage in the sand, on his path, but a metre away from eachother (so about £2 in each hole kinda thing) . he found it and had the cutest, most smug smile ever and was screeching with excitement with every find. we eventually got home and he showed the family what he'd found and mum was actually quite surprised. 

although dad has a good job and £7 is a laughable amount to him, the pure joy he got from finding something, is definitely worth not telling anyone what really happened that day. ",11
"i make copies of other people's keys for personal use. whenever anyone lets me borrow a key, usually to their house in order to petsit, the first thing i do is go to walmart and make a copy of that key for personal use after they ask for it back. 

i never break into houses and steal anything, other than food or maybe alcohol, but i love the feeling of being able to effortlessly enter a place i know i don't belong without anyone's knowledge.

"i lie about having my university degree and it got me a great job. i went to an ivey league university in ontario canada right after high school. my marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. i spent most of my time in university partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. in my second year i skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. my marks were terrible and i failed a couple of my courses. in my third year about half way through i dropped out and got a job landscaping. 

&#x200b;

i did that for a year when i realized it really sucked and i began to regret not trying harder while i was in school. i figured i would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that i would have gotten. i had spent the few years in school i was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although i dropped out i had a decent knowledge of the area. 

&#x200b;

the field i was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. the company i got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. i was extremely surprised to get my interview. one of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop i had my proof of graduation. i sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. i ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position.

&#x200b;

i have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. they provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. i entered with a starting salary of $72,500 cdn and received annual raises. upon hiring me i was told that the management staff was quite impressed with me through the hiring process and that they usually only hire applicants with minimum requirement of a masters degree.

&#x200b;

i basically shit my pants everyday while in the interview/training process but now i don't really think about it ever. i didn't tell me university friends i faked having my degree. the only people that know i did this are my parents.

"i'm purposely trying not to get my wife pregnant.. i'm in my later 20's. my wife is still in her early 20's. we currently have no kids, two dogs and have been married for only 7 months. my initial plan was to be married for two years and get established in our jobs, which are fairly new, then start trying for kids. i really do want them and i've expressed my concern to her, but she doesn't want to hear any of it. this person got pregnant, this person is due anytime, her friends from high school/college are having kids, etc. she wants a baby.

we dated for a total of three years before we got married. the first two were a sex filled romp. my wife is a freak in bed and she sure showed it. after we got engaged, it slowed down a bit and she wasn't as freaky, but it was still satisfying. now that we're married, she doesn't want anything intimate unless we are trying. if i say, ""hey, wanna have sex"", or even attempt foreplay, she brushes me off...but...if i say, ""hey, let's make a baby!"" she turns back into freak mode.

my wife is one of those that thought if a guy ejaculates inside a woman, she will become pregnant no matter what. she didn't realize about ovulation and peak times and whatnot. so, after she learned about it, she asked me to download the *flo* app and chart her cycles for her. i did, but manipulated the whole thing. when she thinks she's ovulating, she's not and the chances of her getting pregnant are slim to none. 

sometimes i'll tell her that her ""peak"" day(highest chance of getting pregnant) is coming up in a few days so we should start early. we have crazy sex for 3-4 days in a row and then nothing while she's actually ovulating. 

i'm a bad person. i will eventually give her a baby. just not anytime soon.",11

"i made my brother think he has alopecia for the last fifteen years.. this is probably the pettiest thing i have ever done, and i regret it to this day. when i was fifteen years old, i got my first job and started to have some money of my own. i used my money to spoil myself and purchased nicer thing like clothes, shoes, makeup and salon brand shampoo.

my brother used to sneak into my bathroom and constantly steal my nice shampoo. he would use them and most of the time he would leave them open in the bathtub. this would result in the rest of the shampoo going down the drain and leave me with empty containers.

this drove me completely insane and i hated him for taking my things. i tried to speak with my parents about this, but they told me that i should just learn to share.

one day i went out and purchased hair removal cream. i mixed this into my shampoo bottle and left it in my bathroom. i gave him a verbal warning not to use my newly purchased bottle, but he stole it again anyway. over the next few days his hair slowly started to fall out and small bald patches started to appear.

seeing what i had done i immediately emptied the remaining shampoo. i felt terrible and i truly didn't think it would have as a dramatic effect as it did. my mother took him to the doctor to get check out and they diagnosed him with alopecia. he than had to start using this special and terrible smelling shampoo to combat this.  

his hair did grow back but i just recently found out that he is still using the shampoo in order to prevent another alopecia flair up. it has been 15 years now and i have never told my brother that i caused him to lose his hair.

edit:

some people are asking why i let this go on for 15 years. i honestly had no idea that he was still using the shampoo and just assumed he stopped at some point or that the doctor had told him he didn't have alopecia. 

i just helped him move over the weekend and found a fresh bottle of the shampoo in his bathroom. i completely forgot about this until now.

edit 2:

he lived in the basement in the mother in law suite. so it did take a lot of effort for him to come in my second floor private bathroom to steal my shampoo and conditioner. not trying to defend my poor decision but he didn't just happen to use it by mistake. i didn't just leave my things lying around.",11
i shit on my neighbors door step. so back when i was ten my dad asked me if i wanted to make 20$. i accepted.  the catch i had to shit on our neighbors door step. it was clear my dad had beef with this woman.  she woke in the morning and tried to blame our chihuahua.  my dad yelled at her saying that the  shit was bigger then our dog.  impossible. the point is i don't feel bad. forever daddy's girl.,11
"when i was a server i threw a customers phone into a trash compactor. i had just started serving tables at a restaurant,  and i was working my first super busy brunch shift. i had 6+ tables and i'm not gonna lie, i had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. i could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. i apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. i offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. when i walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that i was an ""incompetent cunt"". 

let's stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time i ever had experienced being spoken to like i was garbage. i shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. they started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. they told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering i couldn't even serve tables, ""honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks"". when i took their order for food, one woman refused to speak to me. she just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. by now i am pissed. i asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? she laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because i was a dumb little bitch. 

due to the fact i was at work, i couldn't argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like i was a dog, if i did my boss would have fired me. they ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. once they left, i realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. i took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? so i promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. she came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, i told her that i didn't see it when i bussed the table, and that i would call her if it turned up. i never told anyone but i never regretted doing it. when you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you


edit #1. thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger! 

edit #2. i should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn't tip me. they did pay their bill before they bounced

when i came to school the next day though the same kid i bought the pringles from, gave me back the $40 while crying because apparently his mom screamed at him to give it back and now he couldn't buy candy with it because his mom wouldn't let him keep it. i held on to that money for a couple days until my mom started looking around and asking if i had seen the money laying around since it wasn't in her purse, so once i realized how i'd get my ass beat if she found out i hid it under the couch and 'found' it about 30 minutes later. i never got caught but still look back on it and laugh that i essentially got some pringles for free from the whole ordeal.",11

this is petty. i don't care.

i've worked at a company for two years. in that time, i've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'.

i wish i was joking.

this company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher ups. a guy who has never worked for anyone except his mommy (who owns the company). a guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out bluetooth.

moron would be a compliment. you think i'm just being harsh on my boss, or exaggerating.

i wish. i wish it was just me being dramatic.

last phonecall i had from him was him asking where he was. no, i'm serious.

""foot, i'm driving. where am i?""

he asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if i can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then i am to gps voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn.

this is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man.

""foot, did you get my email?""

""yes, i responded to it and answered your questions.""

""oh good. read it out to me.""

proceed to read the email to him. he is happy.

fast forward two hours. get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply:

""foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! this wastes my time.""

i no longer do my regular job. i've been transitioned into this 'personal assistant' role, even though i did not want it. at all. to the point i'm currently searching for a new job.

the company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six *years.*

in my day to day, i also assist other departments. i have access to various software. i work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when i'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so i don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot')

based on my observations, i found several problems that are costing us money. either by purchasing, distribution or just general lack of adaquate price adjustments. some were serious enough that i even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the ceo to ask if i can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems.

ceo is boss's mother.

i get told that i absolutely am not allowed to transfer. that i am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. that boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made.

manager and i were stunned. turns out, mother wants to step away from the company and wants boss to run it. that boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company.

boss gets called in, told that i identified several issues and that boss needs to get them resolved. boss gets mad at mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (again, i'm not joking. sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit).

boss later calls me into his office, and tells me that i am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that i'm to give him all my notes, tell him how i fixed it and he will present it to the board. boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer i gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that i need to pay more attention to things like that.

i hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation / project and shredded them.

oops. sorry! i'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. i'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'.

here is hoping boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having.

excuse me while i make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time.

because, in the words of boss: ""maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it.""

i hope i get fired.

"i lied to my best friend to get off the phone not knowing he was writing his suicide note and just wanted one last chat.. one day after school i was with a few friends and we were all smoking, at some point during the session i got a call from my best friend who sounded a bit out of it and didn't really seem like he had any other intention than to just have a conversation. we spoke for about 2 minutes and then it was my turn in the circle so i told my friend that my phone was about to die so i was going to have to get back to him. 

the next day i awoke to multiple missed calls from his mother, i called her immediately and she told me that he had hanged himself and that he was in a coma. i would then go on to spend 4 days in a hospital by his side for the most part, on the fourth day they turned his life support off. 

during all of this i checked his phone as i was the only person who knew his passcode and i found a suicide note, the timestamp was around the time that he had called me the day before. i'm not sure if i will ever get over the fact that i gave up my last conversation ever with the greatest person i've ever known for a bong.

"our first daughter was raped at 14 and we raised the baby as our own child. our first daughter committed suicide and we carried on raising the baby. my grandchild thinks we're her parents and i cant bring myself to tell her the truth even now. this is a lengthy confession. i'm sorry if you don't like reading long posts you can skip to the end if you want.

our first daughter was raped when she was 14. it destroyed her childhood and flipped our lives upside down. you always assume if you bring your child up right and take care of them nothing bad will happen, but something bad just happened anyway and there was nothing we could do afterwards to make what happened right. the man who did it got sent to jail eventually, but our daughter was never the same again. counseling never brought her smile back, nothing seemed to work. she seemed so cold and emotionally dead from there onward and we tried so hard to connect back with her but nobody could. she was an island and didn't want to talk to anyone about anything. we as parents blamed ourselves for this.

we ended up pulling our daughter out of school to home school her because her attendance was very bad and she suffered night terrors which kept her awake some nights. it was probably a bad decision and over protective parenting, but we wanted to protect her and felt a regular school wasn't a safe environment for her at the time. 

as if the situation could be any worse we found out our daughter was pregnant with the rapists child. we tried to suggest an abortion because of her age and the situation, but she didn't want to. our daughter refused to abort the pregnancy, so we kept her out of school to give birth to the baby. we raised the child as our 2nd daughter to give our 1st daughter the life she was robbed. we just wanted her to enjoy her life and told her we'd raise the baby for her as her sibling and she agreed to this.

it was partly out of fear of what the neighborhood would think, and partly out of wanting our daughter to continue having a normal teenage life. it wasn't ideal, but things worked for a time and our daughter got to see her daughter whenever she wanted, which was better than giving the baby up to adoption. things didn't last this way for long though as our daughter's mental health started to deteriorate. 

when our first daughter started to become heavily suicidal. there was nothing we could do because every time we tried to get closer to her she'd push us away worse than before. she was hospitalized several times for suicide attempts until she succeeded in committing suicide. this destroyed us. at first we hated the baby and blamed it. we blamed it for the death of our daughter and were in denial it was our fault. eventually though we realized we were to blame, not the child who was brought into the world by no fault of their own. we'd focused for so long on the fact it was half of the rapist's child, that we'd overlooked the fact it was also half of our daughter.

it took a lot of time to come to this conclusion, but we'd always looked after the baby out of respect to our daughter. the thought of giving it up to adoption went through my mind several times, but i knew my daughter didn't want this and so did my wife.

we gave her daughter, our daughter the best life we could. we bought her anything she could ever want, took her to concerts and on holidays. we even sent her to a private school despite the extra expense with hopes that she will become successful in life and live the life our daughter never got to live.

she is home right now and whenever she hugs me or my wife and says: ""i love you mom/dad"" it hurts like a dagger through our hearts. i always look towards my wife every time our daughter says it. she finds it as painful as i do and i can tell by the look in her eyes. it's not that we don't love her, it's that her entire life is being lived believing a lie. we're actually her grandparents and she has no idea of this. she's never asked if we're really her true parents because obviously she has never had a reason too. part of me though believes lying by omission is still lying though. we've never told her the truth about her sister being her mother.

she knows her sister committed suicide, but she is too young to remember her. i feel as though we're protecting her from being damaged and hurt by keeping her oblivious to all of this. maybe i'm just being selfish, maybe my wife is too. we just don't want to see her suffer.

the thought of her not being strong enough to hear the truth scares me the most. i know i shouldn't compare her to my other daughter, but i would never forgive myself if she committed suicide too after learning the truth. i cannot lose both of them, i can't survive another loss like this.

the whole situation is soul crushing. the only person i can talk to is my wife. it feels like some massive thing nobody else can ever know. not even our parents know the truth.",11
"i anonymously put my friends phone number on a gay craigslist add. this was a few years ago before cl stopped the relationship stuff. as a joke, i created an add of craigslist relationships - male looking for male. 

essentially the add was pretty much a guy looking for a 1 way ticket to pound town, ready to fuck and suck anything,  willing to be a cum dump, and all types of things. i made sure to make it for serious inquiries only. i put his phone in the weird code like everyone else on similar adds like 5(5)5-five-three37-55(four)5.

i sat back an waited. the next day, he makes a fb post about ""who the fuck put my number on a gay craigslist add,"" and if he gets 1 more dick pic he ""will strangle whoever did this."" as you could imagine, the comment replies on his post were great.

"i once skunked a bottle of wine given to a bullying manager on my team then gave it to her. many moons ago i was working for a large technology company. it was common practice for managers on the same team to exchange some sort of token holiday gift just before christmas - something under $20. 


one of these managers was a very nasty woman who was quietly bullying some of her employees and one of the other managers on our team. we were trying to deal with her through the proper channels but, the holidays sprang up in the meantime. 


when the holidays came around, i bought a case of a nice red wine that i enjoyed and prepped them all with giftbags. except one bottle - the bottle for the nasty manager. 


i took that bottle and spent about two weeks heating the bottle and chilling the bottle by wrapping it in a particularly warm heating pad and standing it on top of my old apartments hot water heater for one or two hours then sticking it in the freezer until the bottle was cold to the touch. my goal was to ruin the wine, turn it to vinegar. 


the holidays came and i gave my fellow managers their gift wine and we all headed out of the office for a few days for company-wide ooo. 


when we came back everyone was talking about how wonderful the wine was. except the nasty manager, who was surprised everyone loved it. she was going on about how nasty it was and how bad it smelled and how she couldn't even drink it. 


it was intended as a harmless prank but, when she was fired a few days later for bullying people, she exploded and mentioned my ""shitty wine"" in her tirade as she threw things around the office on her way out the door. i felt some degree of pride about that because fuck her for bullying people.

"i made my school believe they broke my ipad and made them buy me a new one.. my highschool didn't allow phones/tablets to be on your person throughout the school day, instead they made us all hand our devices in every morning and pick them up at the end of the school day. they provided us with these white cushioned envelope bags to protect them by it really did nothing. 

anyway one morning i was rushing to catch the bus and on the way out of my bedroom i decide to throw my ipad onto my bed. but it bounced off, landing face down on the slate tiles. i knew straight away it smashed from the sound, i stood there cursing myself until i had an idea. i grabbed my phone bag and put the broken ipad and shattered glass in it and took it to school. 

i handed it in acting nonchalant about it and when it came time to pick it up in the afternoon i put my best shocked/sad face on as i opened the bag. i went to the nearest teacher and told her that i found my ipad broken. she took me to the office and eventually to the principal. at first she seen suspicious about the entire thing but when my dad (25 year army veteran) came in to pick me up, he gave her and the entire admin staff a spraying.

she originally agreed to pay for it to be repaired but when that couldn't be done she agreed to buy a replacement model. but the thing is that the ipad was a 2nd gen model and it was 2014 so ended up getting a brand new model as well. 

i never admitted it to anyone in school out of fear it would eventually lead to the principal finding out. 

edit: the teacher didn't pay for it, the principal used the schools credit card

"i used to work in a shoe shop and deliberately sold a customers shoes whilst she was trying on shoes, just to make her buy a new pair.. title says it all. i was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. we had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. i was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. one day, she was up to her usual saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much...  they were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. i quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn't find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. he was having none of it stating it wasn't the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. the woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. we never saw her again.


edit: thankyou for all the replies. i would never have believed this posting would generate so much interest as i posted this story over a year ago as a reply on askreddit and only received 3 replies, lol.

to elaborate on the story and answer some of the questions raised; firstly, yes, it is a true story and happened some time over the school summer holiday period of 1984 shortly after i started working at the store. the department i worked in wasn't exactly the normal shoe shop environment most people are familiar with. i worked in a special department on the lower ground floor of one of the larger branches of a national shoe retailer and this department sold all the reject stock from all the other branches. stuff such as shop soiled, sun faded stock from window displays, repaired damaged stock, customer returns etc. the stuff that was below the standard that could be sold in the regular departments. all stock we held was displayed on the shop floor on racks so you couldn't ask for different sizes etc as it was all random stuff. we only displayed the right foot of a pair of shoes and customers had to ask for the left foot of the shoe to try on, and there was a rule that only one pair could be given to one customer to try on for security reasons. we had a major problem with shoplifting and there were only normally two or maximum three members if staff manning the department. it was a hell of a job keeping track of the pairs that were handed to customers to try when the shop floor was busy, and often shoplifters waited till we were all distracted then left without paying. this was before cctv so all we had were our eyes to monitor where paired stock was on the shop floor... the woman i describe as awkward, wasn't just awkward in the traditional sense, she was totally obnoxious, narcissistic, racist and constantly demanding attention. her behaviour lost us a lot of stock to shoplifters because she distracted us from watching other paired stock out on the shop floor and she wouldn't return pairs she didn't want, just kicked them off in a corner before wandering around looking for the next pair. a couple of weeks before the story, a pair of shoes she had asked to try were stolen because of her doing this and her attitude when we asked her, was that it wasn't her problem and we deserved to lose stock because we were all jews (sorry if this is offensive to you but that's what she said)... back to the original story, lol, the incident wasn't premeditated, it was one of those spontaneous  'fuck you' opportunities where all rationality temporarily disappears for a moment. the elderly lady handed me the bitch woman's shoes and that was it, lol. i only asked the elderly lady for either 50p or £1, i can't remember what, bagged them and the sale went through the till followed by a thankyou... incidentally, the condition of the bitch woman's shoes and quality of brand was a lot better than the crap we sold, so the old  dear got one hell of a bargain... my thoughts immediately afterwards weren't of satisfaction, they were of 'oh shit', and i was bricking it, worrying what would happen next, lol. when the shit hit the fan and the manager became involved, i was just glad he was pre-aware of her and had no sympathy of her loss because of her attitude when she previously lost our stock.

once again, thankyou for all replies and unexpected flow of upvotes.",11

"i sold sodas in high school after a ban of soft drinks was put into place to pay for senior fees. i ratted out my compettition.. jr year a ban in ca prohibited sale of soda in public school (specifically lausd). 

i seeing a a need by many decided to spent my small savings from  allowance (17.00) on 3 costco 24 packs. school was selling at the time for .75 cents prior to the ban. so i matched the price. roughly making 18.00 every 24 pack which was about 13.00 in profit per 24 pack.

after my first week and 3 trips to costco i made enough to buy more inventory per trip minimizing my trips to costco and cutting into profits. added variety to what i had(started with coke, then added sprite, then dr pepper). 

at first i was holding in my locker but realize heat was an issue. invested in an insulated bag and had 2-3 frozen waters inside to keep things cool, and added help was chilling the drinks the night before also, i was sold out on average before lunch or at the begining of lunch.

4 months i noticed sales drop and i was leaving school with inventory. found out i had competition of others who not only picked up on what i was doing but started selling flavor variety like cherry coke, fanta, shasta and what not. by this time i had already established myself with faculty and  added diet cokes/diet dr peppers per request, yup, paid then off with free drinks which took a hit on profits weekly but secured me from getting in trouble with most security guards where i made transactions and classes i had and a few trusted teachers from previous semester. on average lost about a 6 pack to 9 sodas weekly, no big. had the principal and a few vice principles buying as well.

needless to say competition wasnt something i needed. had em get pinched by faculty once i found out who it was. out of 6 (including myself) 4 got caught, the other gent i let him continue doing what he was doing because i knew his background and he and his fam needed the money. 

i did get pinched by a substitute in class, was sent to the same vice principle who was a buyer. all i was told was be careful and sat in his office till next class period started.

my end goal was to pay for all senior fees which include cap, gown, diploma, senior night, prom and senior ring. 

by early senior yr i had made enough to cover all fees, including my tux rental and my portion of a limo for prom night.

also bought a ps2 and saved the rest as a base starting point for. used car ( after starting a job and saving for an additional year it ended being a 97 honda accord, so nothin fancy)

end of senior yr i helped 2 jrs continue what i was doing and helped them figure it out and connected them to my faculty buyers.

i have 0 regerts about it all. 

update: holy crap this blew up while i was in class! 

what's gold?! what's silver?! 

thank you to who ever gave them to me...can i buy soda with it!?

i should also clarify this happened back late 02 to early 04. just figured stature of limitations expired and figure some people would enjoy it.

appreciate the love 

answering some questions: 

-yes i'd do it all over again, roughly 1300 in student dues was a burden my parents didnt need on them, not including the 300.00 for tux and limo fees.  i'm glad i didnt have to go sell candy to raise the money in a saturated market in which everyone was doing the same damn sales in the same district.

-yes, i was a snitch, but i felt i was in a position where i had 0 repercussions to face since i was well liked. it was a power move and it worked. 

- the ones caught got a week detention and that was it. 

i'll try and answer any questions i can 😁.",11

"i told my mom to 'just die already' while she was sick with cancer. i felt like this is the best place to confess this guilt that has been apart of me for the last 10 years. 

my sweet mother passed away when i was 9 years old. during her gruesome battle with ovarian cancer, i got frustrated seeing her rapidly deteriorate, i just said what came to my childish mind: i wish you would just die already.

nine year old me couldn't comprehend the situation, so i left her to cry and walked away with guilt. we never spoke about it, and she passed away months after that happened.

"my little brother became a transwoman. she's incredibly pretty and it's killing me inside with jealousy as her sister.. i'm drunk and this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

like the title says, my little brother (who was always the favorite one) came out to my family three years ago as trans and started her hormone therapy to become a woman. it was a bit of a shock but i love my brother(/sister) and i wished the best for her. my parents were another story and essentially disowned her and never spoke of her again.

since then, she's went through insane changes on her hormones, gotten surgery (voice change and adam's apple removal), and now she's fully passing as a woman. but she passes too well, like she's turned into fucking levels of fashion model pretty and it's pissing me off so fucking much. it's like hormone therapy gave her the face the females have in my family, but with all the right proportions and then made her look younger by a decade... whenever we hang out, guys start talking to her and flat out ignoring me (ie i don't exist apparently). i've always been considered to be the ugly duckling between the two of us (before she was a she), and now she's considered the ""hot"" sister. 2 months ago, she's turned into a literal fucking model after someone came up to her on the street and asked her to audition for a new ad campaign (for a fucking clothing chain). they had no clue she was trans because by now she's changed all her id to her new gender. i feel so guilty for thinking this, but i was secretly hoping that she would at least have some trouble with passing as a woman because i've been shit on and bullied for my looks (family, friends, everyone) since i was a kid while he's always had a girlfriend/been good looking/hyper popular/better grades.

but no i'm still the ugly one with horrible cramps that leave me paralyzed whenever its shark week and she's the one getting modeling gigs while hot guys message her non-stop. i'm trying to be there to support her because she has no one else to turn to for family but her fucking face is on billboards and bus ads now smirking back at me daily. she asks me for advice and confides me in me about things that i've never even had opportunity to have. what made me start drinking tonight was that she asked me what she should wear to an upscale party (something i've never been to) on some fucking rooftop penthouse with billionaires and actors. at first i kept my calm but then she went through the ""budget"" the clothing company gave her (20k+) for the night and her measurements (so i'm also morbidly fat apparently). i had to make up an excuse to leave, immediately went home and started taking shots of vodka. it's petty to think this way but i fucking hate my life right now.

"i killed my pet iguana. it was 12 years ago, i was 7. his name was leafy and i had him for several months. my father and i built him a special terrarium made out of an old chest. one day, i opened it up to feed him (he would only eat if i hand-fed him) and he jumped directly at me. i panicked and shut the trunk immediately, but to my dismay i shut it right on him, directly on his back. half his body was inside the trunk, half outside. it didn't cut him in half, but it definitely hurt him severely. his little iguana mouth was wide open, as if voicelessly screaming in agony. i opened the trunk and he fell back down, seemingly paralyzed.

for the next few days he would eat a little and move around, but on the third or fourth day i woke up and he was dead. my guess was that i probably tore up his insides and fatally injured his back. his last few days must've been in agony. he didn't even live that great of a life, and he was only four months old.

"my husband and i decided to indulge in a little cocaine tonight and used it to clean the shit out of our house.. my husband (33) and i (28) have been married for almost 6 years and together for about 9. no children besides our puppies, but we hope to have some in the near future. while we are not regular hard drug users, we do like to have a little fun once in a while.

"i kicked a kid in his balls and he had to have one removed.. this happened when i was around 7 or 8 years old. it was my first year in primary school and i had joined the school with some of my friends from the local feeder school in the area. 

one particular boy was a year older than us and was repeating the first year for some reason. he was of german descent, from a very well to do family and a lot bigger than the rest of us. possibly because he was embarrassed at repeating the year he was a bit of a bully. he often picked on me and some of my friends. i'm sure we probably escalated things at times too because i know he was teased for being german. 

so one day, standing outside class i kicked him full whack in the balls. he buckled over but i can't really remember much of what happened afterwards, we probably tucked tail and ran. i can't even say for sure whether he deserved to be kicked at the time or if i just thought i was getting him back for previous behaviour. 

anyway, he missed school for a few days after and i heard some kids saying he was in hospital. soon after that i was called in to speak to a teacher who as far as i remember dressed me down and explained he had gone home and his testicle has swollen up to the size of a tennis ball and it had to be removed. i don't really remember getting into much trouble about it but i do remember some of the other kids going on about it in banter. 

the details are hazy but i felt so bad and i felt i was in so much trouble that i never ever told my parents about it. this was made worse as my dad and his dad had gone to school together, only found this out after seeing my dad chatting to his dad at a rugby match that me and the kid were playing one saturday about a year after. i was freaking out the whole time they were speaking and then started feeling guilty that my dad might have been seen as rude by his dad for not apologising for my action. it didn't come across that way, as they seemed like old friends catching up but i felt so guilty. 

i felt so awful about it, i mean at the time i didn't realise that it may have an affect on him being able to have children but i felt like i'd done something so horrible and always expected my family to confront me about it. when i learnt of the reproductive challenge this might cause the guilt was just amplified. 

the years that followed in primary school were mostly fine, on the odd occasion he would have a go at me, i remember him having a slightly shorter fuse with me than others but i think he ended up being ok and less of a bully. saying that, he did try drown me in a river at our primary school leavers camp as i'd pissed him off for some reason but mostly the in-between years went by without incident. 

i left that school to go to a different high school so i never maintained contact with him. i saw him once during my teenage years and we chatted for about 5 minutes. i remember it being friendly. i never, ever mentioned it. 

i hope he was able to have children. i'm sorry bro. i'm sorry i never said sorry too.",11
"no regrets after a briefly successful suicide attempt 8 months ago, i visited the bathroom i died in and words cannot express how grateful i am to be alive right now.. on june 27th 2017 i intentionally overdosed on heroin in the handicap stall of the ladies' room in oglivie transportation center. and it worked. i was found with no pulse and not breathing. for months i resented the fact that i was brought back. i laid awake every night sobbing, abusing every drug i could get my hands on, and even attempted suicide two more times but to no avail. 

since then i met the love of my life, and she makes me want to stay sober. i want to remember every moment i spend with her. she proposed to me a bit over a month ago and i want to live as long as possible so that i can grow old with her. on our first date we went to a protest, and got cold so entered the first building we saw. it was ogilvie. we ate panda express and had our first kiss there. i didn't even realize it at the time but she gave me life in the building where i had almost successfully taken my life. yesterday we went back there and i showed her exactly where i died. i am almost 5 months clean now and am so fucking happy that i was given another chance at life.

the road leading here was rocky, but i'm grateful for every bump along the way because this was the road that lead me to her. that's not to say the road isn't still bumpy, but we have each other to ride it out with. 
we've had some devastating financial hardships recently and are homeless. but home is where the heart is. home is holding hands and laughing at our situation from a bus stop bench. home is cuddling up in an alley to stay warm in 0° weather. it's kind of funny that now i want to live, and i have to worry about surviving. this is a new feeling. it's stressful,  but i'm happy. the only tears i've been crying lately are happy ones.

edit: i'm not depending my life and sobriety on one other person, i was already on medication, sober, in therapy and on the right track when i met her. she just makes me extra grateful for life because i didn't think love would ever be an option for me and she supports me and my healthy goals.",11
"i pretended to be the merch guy at a concert so i could steal t-shirts.. pretty much just the title. 5 or 6 years ago my wife and i went to see a band we used to love. after 20 minutes or so of waiting for the merch guy to come man his booth, i had the bright (and very drunken) idea to pretend to man the booth myself. it really started as a funny gag just to make her laugh. almost immediately people came up to buy stuff. i turned them all away, which made them very confused. however, my wife did pretend to be a customer and i ""sold"" her two shirts, which really we just stole.

in my defense, i never took anyones money (i told them i was waiting to get the square reader from the bands frontman) and we did originally intend to pay for the shirts, their merch guy just never showed up. i remember it once or twice a year and am overwhelmed by guilt... for like a minute.",11
"i conspired with our local brewpub to stop selling my husband growlers of ipa because the beer made him smell so bad.. i may get downvoted for this but here goes. my husband loves ipa beer but it makes him smell so bad it's not even funny. it just reeks out his pores and will actually make our sheets and his pillow case smell bad. it also really doesn't matter what brand or how high quality it is, whatever is in ipa doesn't mix with his body chemistry. 

his favorite beer by far is from a local brewpub. i'd say he was drinking about 2/3 growlers of their ipa a week. i finally couldn't take it anymore so one day at lunch i went in and asked to speak with the owner. he is a very super cool guy and he said that he also can't stand ipas because it's the reason so many bad breweries have been able to open because ipas take very little skill to make and people often cover up mistakes with the intense flavors. so he and i worked out a deal that any time my husband came in, he and is workers would tell him they were out of ipa but they would offer him a more traditional lager at a discount. our hope was that eventually he'd lose the taste for ipa and stop stinking up our house. i even offered to work out a deal with the owner that i pay him whatever he was losing in the discount and he told me not to worry about it. 

so it's actually worked. i've tricked my husband's taste buds into liking lighter beer and he seems to be past the disgusting ipa stage and he smells way better. 

suck it shit beer.

"i ended a girl's gymnastics career when i karate kicked a door open and broke her toe. we were at a gymnastics camp when we were teenagers and there was a swinging door that i had wanted to bust open with a sweet karate kick all week long. the only thing stopping me was that i was afraid there was going to be someone on the other side and i didn't want to hurt anyone. well the last day comes around and i said fuck it, and kicked that door as hard as i could. my friend and teammate was on the other side and the door caught on her big toe, pulling it back and breaking it so badly she couldn't compete for almost a year, missed regionals, and ended up quitting. she just assumed i had pushed the door open like a normal person but nope. i karate kicked that bitch. i still feel bad about it and it was about 15 years ago. sorry girl.",11
"i stole a microwave from walmart out of desperation. i while back while i was still in college i lived with my then fiancee in a very over-priced apartment in a relatively big city. at the time, my job was only paying about $7.50/hr and i was studying and working full-time just to pay the bills. basically a decent yet expensive apartment, and *just* enough money to pay the bills.. not much wiggle room.  


well one night my s/o was at work and i was at home, heating up some leftovers for dinner in our microwave and as i go to take the plate out, it slips and hits the door of the microwave on the inner edge and completely **shatters** the front of the microwave. so i'm freaking, expecting my s/o to come home mad at me and/or just stressing about having to buy another one. and then i saw a walmart receipt on the counter and i went to walmart.  


it was probably around 9pm, my s/o was going to be getting off soon, so i'm rushing. i walk in, find the *exact same* model of microwave that we have, and grab it off the shelf. i took the receipt out of my pocket and held it with the microwave, and just walked out the door. after getting it out and setting it up i told my s/o i cleaned the microwave. never told a soul about it. that was probably about 6 years ago... still using the microwave :/

edit: holy shit i didn't think this would get so much attention. i'm going to reply to some comments later today but i'm about to work a 10 hour shift so it'll be a while.

also yes my relationship dynamic at the time was toxic. i found that out about 6 months later. in a much better place now. thanks :)",11
"i met my current boyfriend by slipping him my number while he was on a date with someone else and i was their server.. i used to work at a cheesecake factory as a server. about 1.5 years ago my current boyfriend came in with some other girl for a date. i'm not sure what it is about my boyfriend but he just does it for me. he's not at all my normal type of guy i'm attracted to but for some reason he just makes me melt every time i look at him. 

he's got this super self assured smile and something about the way he talks gets me. he's got this little chuckle he does and he always looks down and bites his lip after...he's just like **it** for me. 

so i immediately rushed over to their table. typically, if i saw a guy i was attracted to i could give better service because i genuinely wanted to interact with him and everyone at the table and that usually lead to nicer tips. 

when i started serving them, i couldn't help myself and i was flirting super obviously. so much so my coworkers were telling me to be careful i didn't get complained on. but he flirted back so i was like a shark who smelled blood in the water. 

i spent so much time talking to him at their table other tables i was serving had to call out to me because i'd forget about them. 

honestly, looking back that was more of a date for me and him than her and him because we talked about what he did for work, what i studied, what my favorite foods are, what he likes, music. i must have been at that table, accumulatively, for around 40 minutes.

at the end of it she was being very short with me and him and i kind of figured she'd complain. so i said screw it, scribbled my number down and put it under his card when i gave it back to him.

he texted me that night and we've basically been dating since. i'm moving in with him on friday. 

it was honestly a very rude and shitty thing to do, but i'd do it over again in a second. ",11
"i sent a prostitute to my boss' hotel room. this was an accident and happened about 10 years ago.

i had recently joined a chinese owned company in a fairly prominent position and being the only white guy in the company, they liked to send me to trade shows in china to indicate that the company was definitely not chinese.

i was sent to guangzhou to the hotel dong fang just around the corner from the convention centre (extraneous detail not really needed but here to show this is genuine).

of course with a convention centre in town with many visitors, the prostitute madams/agents were out in force. most of the people handing out cards for whores where very young kids (seriously young. they looked about 10 years old or younger), often the only english they spoke was, ""you buy, so cheap"".

every time i went out, i had kids pushing cards into my hands, into my pockets or dropped into any boxes i was carrying. most of the time that was that. end of story.

on my my second to last day, i went out with the sole intention of buying presents for my wife and daughter, when after the first shop i was approached by an older madam who would not leave me alone.

every step of the way she kept with me encouraging me to ""buy, so cheap"". even my protestations that i was married and not interested was met with, ""your wife not here, you buy. so cheap"".

eventually, she said, ""tell me your room number. i send girl to your room. just $200"". thinking this was the best way to get rid of her i said, ""$200? ok, i'm in room 1024"" and then carried on shopping. since this was a fake room number and i had no intention of carrying out the transaction, i promptly forgot about it.

next day, last day of the show, i was told the boss had flown to beijing and i was needed to help a colleague collect some stuff from his hotel room. i walked with my colleague, dodging the kids with prostitute cards, back to the hotel until i was standing outside my boss's room.

room 1024.

i have never, ever dared ask or say anything to my boss about this. only my wife knows this story. and so, too, do you.

tl/dr: i accidentally sent a hooker to my boss's hotel room - pretty much what it says in the title.

"i lied about completing a project in the 8th grade and passed anyway.. i completely and 100% despised homework as a kid (and about half of my teenage years). when i was in the 8th grade, we were assigned a project towards the end of the year that counted for a pretty big percentage of our overall grade. from what i can remember, it had something to do with shapes and equations - it was basically like a large project of everything we learned the whole year. i didn't wanna do it. i worked on it a very small amount here and there, but never completed it. the math teacher collected them over a period of a few days, and then was going to spend a few more days grading them all. i played along to all of my other classmates that i turned mine in and even explained what it (maybe) looked like.

the day came and she was finishing up grading all of them, and as she finished each one she gave them back, so some students had already taken theirs home. so she's sitting at her desk and asks, ""spoopypuppy, have i graded yours yet?"" and i quickly replied, ""yes ma'am, you gave it back to me a couple days ago.""

some wonderful, powerful magic force was working hard that day, because all she said was, ""oh, i forgot to write your grade down. do you remember what it was?"" i didn't want to aim too high because i knew what work i was capable of, so i simply said, ""you wrote 89."" and she just wrote it down in her grade book!!!!! she didn't question to see it again or anything!!!

i couldn't believe it worked. that was the only time that ever worked, but it worked nonetheless. i passed math because of that lie. i did learn to just suck it up and do all the work from then on. ",11
"i stole and used my college roommate's fleshlight, then threw it out. it wasn't a real fleshlight, just a knockoff that looked like a mouth wearing bright red lipstick. he said he bought it as a joke and wasn't actually going to use it. one night we went out to a party - at the end of the night my roommate left with a girl and i went home alone. i was pretty drunk and horny, remembered his knockoff fleshlight, and thought borrowing it would be a great idea. i could use it then clean and return it and he'd have no idea. i grabbed it, lubed it up and went to town. it actually felt quite nice. shortly after finishing, but before i had a chance to clean things up, i hear the front door opening... roommate had come home early. i panicked and needed to get rid of the evidence as soon as possible, so i opened the window and threw the sex toy out. it landed in the center of our dorm's quad (grassy area where students sit, play frisbee, etc), and that was that.

the next day i went outside to look for it, but it was already gone. roommate asked me if i'd seen it a few days later but i just played dumb. don't think he ever found out what happened because i've never told anyone.",11

"nsfw i snooped through a teachers phone and found her nudes. this happened about 4 years ago when i was apart of the school newspaper my sophomore year of high school.

a little backstory: this teacher was the ""young hot teacher"" so i naturally was crushing on her, like most of the other guys in my school lol. she was super nice, definitely one of favorites and we grew into a nice ""teacher-student"" friendship. we still keep in contact actually, she's helped me with resumes and college quite a bit.

onto the story: one day i was assigned to do an article about our schools culinary program, they had made a big garden so they could have fresh veggies and herbs. i had finished writing the article and was told to go take pictures, but i had no way to take these pictures. the newspaper didn't have any cameras so students would just use their phones but i didn't have a smartphone at the time.

my teacher gave me her phone and told me to take the pictures with that. i took her phone and was making my way down the hall to the culinary garden when i had this thought. ""my teacher crush just gave me her phone, i'm alone, and there could be nudes on this thing..."" i've used an ipad before so i knew my way around an iphone. 

now what else would a horny teenager do? i started going through the photos, there were tons of pictures of her and her husband, friends, pets, etc. i started thinking ""she's not dumb enough to give her student something with her nudes on it"" but i kept scrolling, then it appeared, a full frontal mirror nude...

holy shit i thought i found the holy grail, my heart started beating so fast in that quiet ass hallway i swear you could've heard it. i clicked on it and instantly got rock hard. i proceeded to walk to the garden though so i kept it together and got those pictures. the whole time i was taking them i still had a boner (tucked into my waistband obviously)

now i'm walking back to my teacher, heart still beating hella hard, horny as fuck. ""this is going to be the only time i see my teacher naked so better get the most out of it"" i thought. i go into the bathroom, lock the stall, and rub one out over my teachers phone. it didn't take long at all and i busted the biggest nut.

i clean myself up, close the photos app, click the camera app so it looks like i didn't do anything but take pictures, then make my way to the class. i walk in and hand her the phone, she smiles and says ""get those pictures alright?"" i reply ""yep!"" i go sit down while she transfers the pictures to her computer and emails them to me. 

i finish my article and email it to our class editor and that was the end of it. she never found out and she never asked about it to this day. i've never told anyone this story before today and it'll remain a secret, i sure as hell don't want her to know i did this lol

edit: since a lot of people are saying that this was  a violation of her privacy and i was a creep for doing this - i know it was and i'll admit it was creepy. i'm not proud of it and actually feel a bit guilty, but that why i posted this here, to get it off my chest",11
"i secretly changed our bed. me and my wife bought a new bed. a really expensive one, the kind that has separate firmness on each side. we spent hours and hours in the store, where my wife took her time testing and deciding what kind of lower mattress she wanted on her side. beforehand, she had done extensive web research on what kind of bed would give her most happiness in life, and so on. eventually she settled for one with firmness between soft and medium. 
me, i couldn't be bothered with that. i've always liked my beds soft, but the store lady said that with my body composition, i should have a hard mattress. so during a brief brain fart, i chose that. 

next morning, i knew i had f***ed up. the $2000 bed i'd just bought felt awful. even worse, when installing it i'd taken the plastic wrapping off the lower mattresses so i couldn't return them. 

the solution - while my wife was at work i flipped the bed 180 degrees, so that now i have the soft mattress, and she has the concrete slab. there are two additional full width, thick mattresses on top of those, so it's not immediately noticeable. 

this was five years ago. i've slept like a baby ever since. my wife apparently still hasn't noticed, at least she hasn't said anything, and she seems to sleep well. she must never know, though. ",11

"my favourite thing working as a window washer was going through peoples private possessions.. so i worked as a window washer in my small town in sweden for about 5 years.

every morning you went to the warehouse were we had all of our stuff, drank a cup of coffee with your co-workers and talked for a bit before getting to know the places you had to go to that day, and who you had to do them with.

our bosses were very keen on everyone getting to know everyone so they changed up the ""teams"" every day.

this meant sometimes you got to go out by yourself.

a typical workday is going to 4-5 houses and/or apartments, sometimes old people (they were always home), sometimes familys who were home because they knew we were coming. not very often, you got people who left their key under the mat and let us go inside without them being home.

i likes this the most, since you didn´t have anyone breathing down your neck while you worked.

and sometimes, once in a blue moon, you got a house, with nobody home, by yourself.

i don't know if there´s something wrong with me (maybe).

but to me it felt like i had struck gold, because i knew, i would be able to walk around that house, by myself, checking out every inch of it.

i usally started by doing my job super fast! make sure i had some way of knowing if they got home.

usally i placed a ladder somewhere close to the door so if someone came home they had to move it.

then i got to work.

i never looked to steal anything, it was pure curiosity.

i looked through bathroom cabinets, nightstands, desk drawers and basically anything that you could open, while making sure everything i touched was placed back exactly where  it was before.

&#x200b;

during my years i´ve found diaries with dark secrets, cute secrets and just downright wierd secrets.

i´ve found used condoms in the teenage boys room, dildos and vibrators in the daughters/mothers nightstands.i found a gun under a matress (which in sweden is not something you see everyday)

one couple had a sex-swing hanging in the bedroom, so it´s not really something i needed to look for but i thought it was strange that they didn't take it down when they knew people were going to be in the house.

i once opened a teenagers macbook, and boom, pornhub, paused mid-video.

no password.

no incognito window, nothing.

jewelry, expensive watches and knifes.

one kid had a 3 knifes welded toghether like a ninjastar but with a handle.

"indirectly broke a dryer at a laundromat then gave a fake name and number to the owner. update- i honestly went back to the same laundromat this past sunday. did my laundry, didn't break anything went about my day lol. thank you everyone for the karma and upvotes


last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat.  i had 3 washers going at once. now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. when i pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. i didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. so the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. about half hour goes by and washer 1&2  are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 i decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. about 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said i broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. she took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. she asked for my name and phone number so i wrote down ""trevor lahey"" and some random collection of 10 digits. those of you who watch trailer park boys will understand. so as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. he couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until i had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. he still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc i didn't tell the attendant about the washer. so anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. lol fuck off",11

the first time i ever did this was when i was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. i peeked in and said ""hello"" just to see if someone was home. no one answered. i stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left.

after that day, i was hooked on it. i would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. i never stole anything but i did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. i once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. i took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over.

i felt like i needed to leave a mark so i ended up moving dishes in cabinets. like, i switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. i did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family.

"i recorded a porno over my aunt's wedding video. when i was 14 and 15 i stayed with my aunt cindy for a week while i was working a job. the commute to my job was very long and she lived much closer. it sounds weird to work so young and also to travel for work but it was a family business. 

i couldn't sleep as usual (lifelong insomniac) and i'm awake at 3am flipping through channels on her satellite package. flip flip flip wait a minute. was that a boob? flip back and see real honest to god porn. my aunt had subscribed the playboy channel. #jackpot

it's in the dead of night, no lights on, i've got the volume down as low as possible but this is in the living room and it's a big open area in the middle of the house. so i've got one eye on nasty office sluts get promoted and the other eye keeping watch. i hear someone get up and go into a bathroom. fuck!

i turn the tv off but the satellite is still on. i dig through her entertainment center looking for a blank tape, find one, and slip it into the vcr. i set it to record and then go to bed. i lay awake in bed terrified because if i fall asleep and someone turns on the tv before i get up, they're going to know it was tuned to a dirty channel. 

when the first pinky streaks of morning show in the sky i'm up and in damage control mode. i snatch the tape, change the channel, make sure everything is neat and tidy with the tapes underneath the tv. that's when i find a yellowed label that has fallen off a tape. it says ""cindy and darrel wedding 1985"" no no no no no. look at the ""blank"" tape in my hand, see the faint outline of where a label used to be. they line up perfectly. noooooooooo. 

suddenly i have this smoking gun of a horrible thing i did in my possession. anybody who watched the tape would see 30 seconds of her getting ready with her bridesmaids, cut to half of a porno set in the workplace, then it cuts out later to reveal mid wedding ceremony. what could be more sacrilegious?

"i am a hotel breakfast bandit.. it started after reading about this guy in georgia(https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/39049814/dalton-police-searching-for-breakfast-bandit) who was apparently stealing food from multiple hotels. out of pure curiosity and the desire to do something ""bad"", i decided to try it out for myself.

i live in a pretty big city (think top 10 in the u.s.) so there are no shortage of hotels around. once a week or so to ""treat myself"", i'll target a hotel. i'll walk in confidently pretending i'm a guest, sometimes i'll even make up small talk with the front desk staff like *hey just so i know, what time is check-out?*. i'll hang out in the nearby bathroom for 5 minutes surfing my phone. then i'll come out to the breakfast station and absolutely demolish the waffles, eggs, muffins, pancakes, fruits, etc.

my city has lots of medium-rated hotels with good breakfasts. the best ones have been:

- embassy suites

- holiday inn express

- hampton inn

- fairfield inn

- springhill inn and suites

- best western

- residence inn

all of these are within 10 minutes driving distance. if i rotate through them all on a weekly basis, i only really hit up each of them 5-6 times a year. spread out enough that the staff doesn't remember me; and of course there's lots of staff turnover each year so my chances of being caught are minimal.

"i almost strangled my mother to death when i was 15. reposting this here instead of in r/offmychest, cause this sub seems more fitting. i have been browsing offmychest and this subreddit for a few hours now, since i couldn't sleep. figured i might aswell chip in my story, since i don't often talk about this irl for obvious reasons. please mind that english is not my native language.

as you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom.

&#x200b;

my parents broke up very early, i grew up with my mom. my dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. my mother has had a drinking problem for as long as i can remember. she had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. the way things went down was always the same.

around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. from then on it's a shitshow. she starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. one second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. this always goes on for the whole night. i don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when i was very young, maybe around 5 or something. one night i had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. i was so tired since i was just a little kid but everytime i tried to sit down she would hit me. sometimes i had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until i collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue.

a weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. she then lay there motionless for 10 minutes straight. as a 5 year old, i was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. i tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that i got too used to it.

as i got older she got more and more violent, but the only times i was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancee. luckily no one was ever stabbed. i could go on and on but you get the idea. i never got any help because i was so used to all this stuff. and ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. whenever i brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that i'm overexaggerating things, or outright claimed i was making stuff up. sometimes she apologized ""i will never do it again, honey"". i stopped listening after a while.

school was pretty shit aswell. i had no social skills because i preferred to play video games all day. i was a weird and misbehaving kid, so i was bullied a lot. also i was too afraid to stand up for myself, because i only knew punishment. the fact that we often moved didn't help much. all in all i went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. poland was especially shit. not the country, you polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. thank god that episode only lasted a few months.

anyway, i digress. unsurprisingly i became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, i think it was somewhere around 10 years old. this torture went on for many years.

she came home drunk one morning morning while i was getting ready for school. she didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. as mentioned in the title i was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and i was used to the shouting. also i was basically dead inside. i was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. then she said something about my ex gf. it wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and i was the one who fucked it up. it was the last straw. all these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment.

humans can be animals.

it was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. i had no control whatsoever. i screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all i had. i somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. my big and scary mother whom i was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. not one bit. now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. so she was on her back on my bed and i was standing above her, squeezing her throat. i have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. everything felt so surreal. at some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" i get ahold of myself and i let go of her. fucking mistake.

&#x200b;

she instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. i mean yeah, i technically tried to kill her but now i just want to get out of this alive. i block it and it fucks up my arm. then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. the bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. anyway i manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now i run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and i'm wounded with nothing on me but my pyjamas. i encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. i tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that i'm being taken into care. my mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (it was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. she had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer.

&#x200b;

i moved out into government care. it was honestly cool. by the end of age 15, i had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell i want and social workers that were pretty decent people (kudos to german cps). however shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, i started to drink a lot and later that year i tried to drown myself. that was rock bottom for me.

i've had bad phases since then, there were nights where i wanted to die, nights where i wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where i didn't want anything at all. however all in all life's been gradually improving for me. slowly but steadily. the older i got, the more self-aware i became about my behaviour so i stopped getting bullied. also i learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. however i still ended up quitting school at some point. i realized i can't force myself to do something i despise for even a second. i just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". after that i tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. however i found my true passion. i love making music, and i'm currently putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. i no longer care if i might fail, it's really liberating! my relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. boy it was hard at first, and i made sure to let her know how much i hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. it was easier after that. i could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. she really made an effort to better herself. i also apologised for what i did that day and she forgave me.

i wish i could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. the stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. sometimes i think about what i could have done differently. she knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. but i can't change that. i told her it needs time. it's been only six years since the day police took me. she's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. thank god for that. the last two years were a huge burden. at one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. horrifying.

well, there it is. the story of how i tried to kill my mother. i apologise for the swearing, i got a bit emotional while writing this. granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way i am today, and i'm glad for that. i learned many things and i wouldn't trade that for the world.

people become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. cruel people are often hurting inside. instead encourage them to be the best they can be!

life's too short to be unhappy. strive towards your goals and never settle for less! it could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose!

life's definitely not fair. cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy.

however i realize i'm still only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. i plan on doing so. i don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, i want to be able to love and trust somebody again. i want to get married, have atleast 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. just be happy. i know i'll get there, one day at a time.

*tl;dr - i was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. i've pretty much made up with her. now i try to live my life as best as i can.*

&#x200b;

phew, i did it! it feels like i wrote up an entire novel. contrary to my expectations, i actually feel better now! if anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :)

edit: i'm waking up this morning and jesus christ this blew up... i've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! they mean a lot to me! i'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions.

also people have been asking me about my music. i prefer not to disclose anything here, i don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :)


editedit: i'm at a loss for words, man. just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! it's just surreal. these comments are coming in faster than i can reply but there is something i wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times.

i understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. maybe it's partly my fault, because i focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. if so, then i apologize.

but please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. some things did go very wrong, yes. but she also did the best she could in raising me. there was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and i firmly believe that she has always loved me. she just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as i am. that's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" we have to be better than that! i know we can!

so i just want to make it clear that even after what happened i love her. after all, she is my mom.",11
"i stole thousands of dollars in change over 2 years working at mcdonalds. when i was 16 i got a job at mcdonald's. i hated making food and working front counter. i always asked to work drive thru window taking money at the first window. 
this was before credit cards so everyone paid in cash. all i would do is keep a quarter or dime of almost everyone's change i gave back. i would put that extra quarter or dime in a special spot in the register. once i got 5 or 10 worth of change i would dump the change into the right spot and pocket a 10 or 5. 
some nights i would leave with over 50 bucks in cash (a lot to a 16 year old me). no one ever caught on and only twice i can remember people telling me i gave them the wrong amount of change back. i would just act like a dumb kid whom miscounted . 
i don't know how nobody at work caught on because i always had a ton of change at the end of the day.



edit 1 - i never was trying to get over on mcdonald's it was purely selfish act.

edit 2 - this is a confession, not something i'm proud of now.

edit 3 - this was 16 years ago. yes credit card where around but not wildly used yet.

edit 4 - i don't think working fast food is a bad job for a teenager. nor do i think they abused me or mistreated me.",11
"i give overweight customers smaller bakery items. i work in a very popular bakery. my jobs include serving customers by packaging what they want into boxes, stocking the showcase with pastries, cakes, cookies, etc, and occasionally helping in the kitchen.

like any other bakery that does everything by hand, it's not easy to make everything a uniform shape and size for each product. when a customer comes in who is very obese or overweight, i low-key dig around for the smallest of the item that they want, such as the smallest cookies, fritter or donut. in my head i'm thinking, ""they don't need this, they're sick and could use a little less calories. they shouldn't be in here, i'll help them out by giving them a little less"". when really it isn't my responsibility and if they want something sweet that may not be very good for their already bad condition..then whatever i shouldn't hinder something that's going to make them very happy.

i can't say that i will likely stop doing it after confessing..i just still feel like if i don't try and do the little thing to help them, who will?",11
"i used to steal coffee from starbucks.. a couple years ago i downloaded the starbucks app and signed up for the membership to save my card and orders and such. after signing up, you get a coupon in your email for a free coffee of any make/size. at first, i didn't know you had to load it to the app after ordering, so when i went up to the counter and ordered my usual venti caramel frappuccino with an extra pump caramel and extra caramel drizzle. i proceeded to show the barista the code i had in the email, and he said, ""it has to be loaded onto the app."" i honestly had no clue how to use the code, but instead of going through the whole process on the app, he just let me have the free drink. i took this knowledge and used it on other starbucks throughout my town for almost a year. now, i'm not a total dirtbag because everytime i got a free drink, i'd buy a square of lemon cake and leave a couple dollar tip. :)",11

"i gave my brother the drugs that killed him.. it's been 4 years since he died. i know i'm responsible for it. he was 17. he wasn't very popular in highschool, but he'd been invited to his first big party. i was excited for him. he wanted to try get some more friends,become more popular. i helped him pick out what to wear, told him what to expect and do and all that shit. he'd asked me to buy him booze to bring with him, but instead i gave him some of my weed. he'd smoked a couple times with me before, i thought he'd be fine. i dropped him off, and told him to call when he wanted a lift home. that was the last time i saw him alive.

it was about 3am when my i heard my mum crying. from what i was told, he smoked and shared the weed with some people. they decided to go out to get food. my brother was the only one who hadn't had any booze so they asked him to drive. him and 3 people went out, during the drive they say he ""fell asleep or something"". he crashed into a pole, he died on impact and the person the front got their leg injured. the two in the back had minor injuries.

the police investigation was short. the car was okay and wasn't to blame, no signs of speeding, it had to be the drugs. i knew it was my fault. my parents tried to comfort me after i told them i'd given it to him, but i know they partly blame me too,things haven't been the same since.

i fell into a major depression. i drank and smoked pretty much all day. i lost my job. my parents tried to help support me financially but i spent all the money they gave me on booze and weed. my friends all disappeared after i stopped replying to their messages. it took over a year before i realised what i'd become. i started seeing a shrink. got clean. i'm 2 years sober. but every day i still know what i've done. every day i regret that decision.

i've written this out dozens of times over the last couple years. my doctor says it's good for me. i just want to post it online in hopes it does something. i don't even know what. i don't deserve forgiveness.

edit: i would like to thank all of you for your support and care and everything. i honestly didn't expect this and how many people would even read this. 
despite how many of you feel, i do truly believe i am responsible. i didn't make him go behind the wheel, but i gave him the weed that caused it. without that i truly believe he wouldn't have crashed. the police said there was no alcohol in his system and i honestly can't imagine he took any other drugs. but that is behind me now, it's a mistake i have to live with, ive come to terms with that.

edit 2:  i'd also like to clarify he didn't crash at 3am, that's when we got the call after the passenger had been pulled free because her leg got caught and was getting treatment. aplus it was in a semi-rural area, it would've taken police 30 minutes to get there. i believe that the police report said it happened around 1:30 to 2am.

a few have said that weed isn't a drug or wouldn't have caused this. but it is and it did. 2 years ago i would've agreed with you, but after therapy and getting clean i realised it is and that i was a drug addict, to both alcohol and weed. i've also come to terms with this. i hope that anyone in my situation gets help like i did. i used weed and booze as a tool to escape. i used it so i could pretend i wasn't myself for a few hours or just so i could sleep at night. but really it just hid my problems and that isn't healthy. there is help out there.

the only positive i can say from my story is that my brothers death woke me up. since getting clean i've started exercising, i'm going back to university next year, and my mind just feels more clear. it's kind of hard to describe.

i don't want to say 'don't do drugs' or make this a whole weed is bad thing. but don't use drugs to hide from your problems i guess is the point. seek help and help those who need it.

thank you all, truly.

edit 3: this will likely be my final edit to this post. once again, i'd like to thank all who commented for their advice, criticism and everything, it's all important as part of my therapy, even the negative.

what has disturbed me is fighting about weed, people have even messaged me to show their anger at me for saying it lead to the accident. saying that it doesn't make you tired, which is bullshit, i smoked and occasionally did edibles for 4-5 years, a lot of the time to help me sleep. whether it was him falling asleep for a moment and losing control, or a bad trip, or spacing out, or getting distracted, it doesn't matter. many people are insinuating he was drunk, but the police confirmed he was not i believe as part of the insurance claim for the car. i don't know, but they told my parents he hadn't been drinking.

i did this to try get some things off my chest, not so people could argue about how amazing weed is.",11
"i went through my mom's room, stole her meth, and had my brother sell it so we could buy groceries. we . were never caught by my mom or the police.. this is a sad confession, and i pray that no one is ever put in this situation. but you gotta do what you gotta do.",11
"i passed the hardest exam of the class with a bluetooth. my professor posts podcasts of her lectures online and i've been struggling with the material. during the exam i wore my hair down to cover the bluetooth, since it's one of those models that are small enough to fit right into the opening of your ear but still big enough where people know you're obviously wearing one. i had it well concealed behind my long hair and had it connected to my phone plus there's no policy about turning your phone completely off in class during exams; it just has to be on silent and away from your body and off the table. so i zipped my phone inside my backpack so she wouldn't see the screen light up in case anything were to happen and had her lecture playing on loop in my ear while taking the exam, got grades back 2 days ago and passed with 92/100.",11

"i sold my body. when i turned 18 i was homeless, so for 6 months i sold body as a prostitute, to get money, to get somewhere to sleep for a night, hell even to get a shower. it was the worst time of my life. i'm a man and as a male you would think wow that's awesome you scored so much. the complete opposite in fact every day i would see myself in the mirror and cry thinking i'm not capable of love, or even getting on my own two feet. i thought to myself i cannot afford some food for the night let alone to fall in love. having sexual experiences with someone you do not love is the most horrible feeling ever. i don't know about anyone else but i feel like i was somehow torturing myself. it was the hardest, most demeaning, most heart reneging thing i have ever done.  

edit: i still have problems with self esteem because of this, so when my gf wants to have sex. i usually have to convince myself that she wants me for me and nothing else. overall an 8 hour process. so i've decided to tell some of my friends who i don't feel will judge me who may not know. i've read so much support and good vibes sent my way. thank you all so much.

"i sabotaged my father's marriage because he cheated on my mother.. when i was four years old my father and mother divorced because he cheated on her. they had a really rough divorce and had lots of fights. eventually the divorce was settled and my mother and father could move on. my father married his mistress, who i'll call 'e' as to respect her privacy. my father was really happy with her and me and my sister got a stepbrother and two stepsisters with whom we got along really well. skip forward two years and 'e' started acting different and so was my father. me and my sister often couldn't visit our father because he had to 'work', whilst in reality he was free. when me and my sister were there we often weren't allowed to eat at the table, which seven year old me didn't understand. eventually my father started becoming more distant, he didn't wish me happy birthday anymore and missed a lot of important milestones in my childhood, like learning to ride my bike or plays at school. when i was nine my sister and i could only visit four days a month and had to sleep in seperate rooms. i vividly remember that during one weekend that we were there i had accidentaly broken a glass and 'e' had turned furious. she send me upstairs and had me take my socks of which nine year old me found really weird. then she showed me a piece of glass she held in her hand and said that this is what i deserved for my clumsyness. she pushed the shard of glass into the sole of my foot. i yelled and cried and tried to remove my leg from her grasp when i felt a hand on my shoulder. it was my father's hand, he was helping 'e' do this, i don't remeber what happened after that. 'e' also got into a huge fight with my sister and had pulled her by her hair down to the basement. after these two occasions and a lot of verbal abuse we decided to break all contact and tell our mother what had happened (we hadn't told her before because, well he was our father) . my mother knew this was serious abuse but she was too afraid to alert the police since my father had threatened her with violence before. skip forward another five years, i was fourteen and a freshman at the same school my former stepsiblings attended. once i saw them all the memories started rising again. my two stepsisters had become huge bullies and lots of people hated them. me and a couple of friends decided to retaliate and secretly put small bags of marijuana in their backpacks. apparently this had caused a huge fight in their home and my father and 'e' decided to divorce. after this 'e' got into serious financial troubles and my father became an alcoholic. two weeks ago he was arrested for assault. 'e' has alledgedly become a prostitute and my former stepsiblings have been brought into protective custody.  this has all been my fault, it was my idea to put the marijuana in their bags, even though they hadn't done anything to me. i ruined the lives of my stepsiblings and send my stepmother and father into a downwards-spiral. yet in some sick way i don't feel any remorse. my sister has been dealing with a severe eating-disorder after all the verbal abuse from  'e' and has been hospitalised twice. i've tried once to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation since i thought i was an abomination after 'e''s conservative christian rants. now me and my sister are doing better, though we still have traumas. we've thought about starting a lawsuit but because of our ages during the incidents legal advisors have adviced us to just 'move on'. anyway... i'm in a real moral dilemma: i did something that caused horrible things, yet i don't feel any remorse, am i a psychopath?",11
"a year ago i relapsed on heroin and recovered. i never told my wife or kids.. i have a wife and 2 kids, aged 14 and 11. i was a heroin addict from 16 years old to 23 years old, which was when my first son was born. my wife helped me get sober, and remains an amazing person and wife overall. 

&#x200b;

last year, my wife had surgery and got pain pills. i don't know what the fuck came over me, but i just wanted to try one to remember how good opiates feel. i was thinking, it wasnt heroin right? so maybe i wont relapse? i cant even describe how stupid of a decision it was. i wasn't depressed, or particularly yearning for heroin, but i just wanted to try it. literally right away it felt so unbelievably amazing that i took 2 more the next day. on day 3 i took about 4-5, i was high the entire day, feeling absolutely amazing. by day 5, i went to one of the local dealers and got heroin. literally only took me 5 days to get back on heroin. 

&#x200b;

my wife never got a hint. my kids never suspected anything. i was lucky this happened while my wife was recovering from her surgery, she was bed ridden most of the day so i was mostly free to do what i want. i didn't inject, i just snorted. i did it every single day for 2 weeks. the only suspicion was my daughter saying i was acting weird when i was high and when my son went downstairs at night and i was mumbling because i was nodding out. he just assumed i was tired. 

&#x200b;

i knew i had to do something. i wanted to just leave, run away to new mexico or something and just do heroin the entire time, then maybe come back. at the time it was literally all i wanted, i kept making these horrible, immoral excuses for my usage. like oh, my kids are old enough, and my wife is a good mom, they dont even need me! i can just run away and do heroin on an island forever. that was the kind of shit i would think. i knew it was bullshit, but its so damn powerful.

"i accidentally killed my pet mouse last night and i can't get over it.. my boyfriend and i owned two mice. however, they were both male so obviously they'd get into little fights and whenever things got bad we took the black one out because he had the mentality the whole cage was just his. this is the mouse i accidentally killed because he had begun to fight over food (even though we have two separate bowls of food for them) so i decided to go and bring out the black one to calm them both down. well when i grabbed him he bit me pretty hard and everything happened so fast. my reflexes squeezed as he bit me and then he fell when my hand opened really fast after that. at first i didn't understand what happened but his legs weren't working and i realized he made a 'pop' feel in my hand. i started crying and woke my boyfriend up and after he took the mouse i laid down and cried. i couldn't stop crying. how could i do something like that? yeah he was a pain in the a\*\* when he started the fights but he was the first mouse my boyfriend and i got. he ended up dying a 20 minute death because me squeezing him crushed his lungs and he suffocated. i just couldn't stop crying the whole night and couldn't believe that happened to me. now our other mouse has no company and i feel so bad. we ended up giving his body to a snake owner to at least purpose his death. i watched him struggle in his last moments. i held him as he began going limp and i held his lifeless body. i dunno when i'll get over this or if i can. everyone keeps telling me it's okay but i killed a creature i was supposed to help care for and i failed him. i'm so sorry. i also think my boyfriend kinda doesn't mind this happened because this mouse was such an a\*\* he never really seemed to like us and often only pissed us off but still he was our mouse and i killed him.

"i leave fake parking tickets on cars that deserve real ones.. i ordered a batch of them off amazon and leave them wherever. sometimes if nobody is around i make an effort and fill in all the details on it to freak them out before they get to the bottom and see it's a fake.

sometimes i just write something dumb in the comments and leave the rest blank.

i've left them on cars at my university that aren't *technically* illegally parked, and on cars that are parked in no parking zones at my grocery store. i especially do it when somebody is parked in a handicap spot that's not supposed to (no plate or hang-tag).

"i use my roommates face towel to clean up his pee. he still hasn't noticed.. i go to college in midwest united states. i live in a dorm an have a roommate who shares a bathroom with me. he's not from the united states and seems a little nervous to talk to anybody who isn't from his home country. the first few weeks of college, i started to notice pee on the toilet seat. no big deal, i cleaned it up. after about the 10th time, i asked him if he could stop peeing on the toilet seat, or if he does, wipe it up. he said okay and went on his day. about 3 months later, i started to notice pee all over the floor, toilet seat, and all around the toilet; worse than before. i used my own toilet paper and started going through it very quickly, so it was getting expensive. i ended up walking over to his side of the counter and grabbing one of his extra towels. i've been using it to clean pee for about 1 month now and i've definitely noticed a change in color due to the urine and the fact that i've never seen him wash it. i feel bad about it, but what he's doing is disgusting and i've tried to tell him to stop many times. should i feel sorry and stop?

"i used to charge a kid a made up ""fat tax"". a long time ago i was a high schooler at a boarding school. i was a decent kid in the eyes of the teachers and school administration. in fact they liked me so much that throughout my time there i was able to rise through the student ranks. i became a prefect, then i became the head boy, and at one point i had passed training that allowed me to run my own sports sessions or event where i was supervising younger and even a few older kids. this was just basic training for first aid, situational awareness, etc. at one point the school had so much trust in me that i was allowed to leave the school premises alone in the afternoons. this was huge and very few students had this privilege.

in typical fashion, as soon as i received the privilege i began abusing my powers as a free man. the school was very adamant on getting us balanced meals so we weren't allowed to get food delivered (all delivery vehicles were refused entrance). having the privilege of leaving the premises meant that i didn't have to order junk food and risk getting caught, i could simply go out to any fast food joint and bring food back with me. 

it all started out as an exclusive club, myself and my friends were munching on mcdonald's and kfc as the plebians were having the filthy healthy cafeteria foods. then i was offered something i couldn't refuse, money. not long after i had built a whole operation for bootlegging junk food into the school. we had cut off times for orders, a priority list for regular customers, extra fees for late orders, and even a spreadsheet for keeping a record of orders, payments, and profits. this smuggling was next level, we were organised, knew all the fire exits, where to walk to avoid corridor cameras, and how to pack the food so that it's unnoticeable when walking in (mostly used sports bags with a thin layer of clothes). the teachers new something was going on, there was food wrappers everywhere but no one knew how it came in. business was booming and i was making profits of 50 dollars a day, for 3-4 days a week. but it wasn't enough, i was hungry for more. there was a fat kid that ordered regularly, so i pulled the most asshole move you could do to your best customer. i started charging 2x the price for his orders and i would hide behind a bullshit moral barrier claiming we were doing this for his own good since we learned in economics that increased prices reduce demand and so he would be eating less and he would lose weight. the kid saw straight through the bs but in the end he couldn't resist it and continued ordering from me.

"no regrets i conned my way into being a therapist. while on a plane a few months ago, a depressed business man that was sitting right next to me started talking about his problems and how he failed to find a good therapist. 'i would pay a fortune just to find a good one' he said before asking me what do i do. 

yeah, you guessed what i answered. after that he asked me if i accept bitcoin and if we can do it remotely on the phone. 'even better', i thought, just like that guy from 'catch me if you can'. 

after our first calls, the guy was so impressed with me, he told his friend about me. 

i was now dealing with 2 clients and the guilt started to creep in. after a month or so of 'therapy', i confessed to them both. they didn't care.

'you're the best', they said. 

my secret? i'm a hard core misanthrope. and oddly enough, this makes them extremely comfortable. nothing is too shameful to share (i already assume the worst about people), i look at life from the perspective of a detached observer (i'm objective in my analysis), i am a great listener (i barely talk, because i know that what they need is to vent, not to ask for solutions), i am  well read, i traveled the world, i made money etc (i can empathize with whatever they are talking about), i like listening (i find it very educational) and i sell no bs (i'm way to pessimistic for that sh\*t).

so yeah. they are bringing in a third client. it's my pleasure.",11
"i changed my grade senior year of high school, with the principal in the room.. it was senior year of high school, and we were doing a partnered assignment in environmental science, tracking the river behind the school to find its source. there was an odd number of students and i was okay with working alone. 

that day the principal was ""observing"" the teacher, evaluating her performance. my teacher trusted me, and gave me her laptop to do the assignment, and asked if i would show the principal what we were doing. i agreed and quickly finished my assignment. 

the principal and teacher were standing by the door chatting, so i open the powerschool app. there it is... all my friends grades, including mine, staring at me in an excel style format. 

i notice copious amounts of 0's by my name, dragging my grade down somewhere in the low 70's. (i was a minimal effort high schooler) i quickly changed most of the 0's to 70's or 60's. this way it wouldn't look too suspicious. 

my heart was racing as i saved the updated grades, and i didn't tell anyone for a few years including my best friend/ brother. i never got caught, and i still grin thinking about it 6 years later.",11
"i unknowingly did cocaine in the 4th grade. i think i was 9.. during class in elementary school, a friend of mine said he had something to show me and so after school ended, we met up in the bathroom and he pulled out what looked like a golden or brass apple from his backpack. the top unscrewed and inside it was this white powder. he took a pinch and sniffed it and told me that his parents and their friends sniffed it and it made them happy. so i said okay and took a small pinch and sniffed the powder. it was bitter and burned a little but it gave me a jolt of energy. afterwards, we went bike riding and i felt all this crazy energy. we rode and rode around for what seemed like forever at seriously top speed! but then later, we got to a hill that we couldn't ride up because it was too steep. we walked our bikes. the sun beat down on us and i suddenly felt tired. then i felt this pain in my head. it was the first time, i tried cocaine and also the first time, i ever got a headache. i told my friend about the pain and he showed me a pressure point on my hand and to this day, every time i get a headache, i use that pressure point on my hand. sometimes, i remember that day in 4th grade when i did cocaine but most times, i don't. ",11
"in high school, i wasn't let into a party so i called the cops pretending to be a concerned neighbor which ultimately led to a racist cop beating the shit out of a classmate.. so this is coming from a throwaway because even though this was way back in 1991, there are still people who are pissed about this. apparently it was even discussed at the 25 year reunion and people we're genuinely still pissed. 


in 1991 i was a junior in high school in albuquerque, nm and i lived in the far northeast heights. there was a girl christy that was a year older than me but i had known forever because she lived about a block away. we found out that she was throwing an invite only party for seniors and as a group they had spent a small fortune on a keg of good beer (back in the day that meant corona), high end liquor and even decorations. it wasn't a normal high school kegger by an stretch. i figured that even though i was junior i'd known her for so long it wouldn't be a problem if i showed up with a few of my friends. 

nope, they were not letting us in for love or money. the kid ""working"" the door was even on the baseball team with me and he was total dick. when i asked to see christy she told me in no uncertain terms to get the fuck out. 

so we were pissed. we drove to the nearest pay phone and i called the police to report a super loud party that had spilled into the streets and now a group of teenagers were fighting on ""my"" lawn. the dispatcher wanted to know the address and then my address so i made up one on the same street, said my name was mr sevedra and hung up. 

we laughed and figured i'd sounded way too young to be taken seriously and decided that we'd tried. we went to hang out at our school's mcdonalds and figure out what to do next. 

maybe an hour later a steady stream of cars started pulling and we recognized them all from the party. the cops had apparently come screaming down the street shortly after my call and had surrounded the house on all sides. they even blocked off the neighbors behind the party house because they knew kids would jump the wall to escape. the police response had been so intense even my parents heard the commotion from a couple blocks away. 

we sat there trying to go along with the horror and not reveal our shock as the party goers talked about how it was such bullshit because they had specifically kept the party low key to not attract the police. the police had made them pour out all the booze so they were out a huge amount of money. and is if that wasn't enough, the police had found a kid of hispanic decent that went to our high school coming out of the neighbors yard and had basically beat the ever living shit out of him because he wasn't in the ""right"" neighborhood. he showed up to mcdonalds maybe 30 minutes after the main group because they had detained him but not arrested him and his face was completely scuffed up, his clothes were ripped and he was furious. 


my friends and i sat there the whole time just saying ""that sucks"" knowing that we had basically just caused a major incident simply because we didn't get admission to a party we weren't invited to anyways.

"i've been logged into my ex's facebook account for 2 years, reading all her messages and notes. the recent mass-log-out meant i lost access and i feel a massive weight lifted off me, and i've also realized how sick i have been spying on her every word.. me, female 21ish

when we were dating i let her use my phone to log into facebook, and she never logged out. she isn't particularly tech savvy and never noticed there was an extra device logged in, and didn't change the password.  


after we broke up, i was pretty emotionally distraught, but i understood and tried to be amicable. it made it harder that she later began dating my best friend \m\ and even though they were a much better match and i was happy for them, i felt increasingly left out of our social circle and was desperate for any emotional intimacy.  


when i realized i still had access to her facebook, i first was just curious about what she had said about our breakup to her new bf (my best friend), so i thought it couldn't hurt to take a peek.  


i saw that they were in the middle of sexting each other over fb, while i was reading, and the level of their explicitness made me unable to look away. i wanted to read everything that was being said as if it was me on the other end instead of him (i know, awful); but the further back i looked, i realized that they had been sexting for weeks, all the way back into our relationship.  


i felt hurt, but i also understood more why it happened. we weren't a good match to start with, and we were having other problems, so as much as the betrayal hurt, i never said anything because i read the remorse they seemed to genuinely have for what they did in their messages.  


however, i realize now that i also used this injustice against me to justify my own actions, my reading every single message they sent to each other over the last 2 years, and every message previously. only now that i have been forced out by facebooks mass log out push because of security issues do i now see just how much i violated their relationship and how awful it was.  


i justified it to myself along the way by always being there for both of them to give relationship advice when i knew something was wrong (because i read it) or when i knew that they were having a fight and i wanted to be supportive.  


it is only now that it is gone that i realize that i have been neglecting actual relationships with people because i was living through reading the messages with others, obsessively   


i feel more than ever like i need to move on and do everything differently, perhaps admitting to them what i've done.

"i waited for a woman to enter the dressing room in goodwill and switched a pair of mens shorts i wanted out of her basket with a similar looking pair, immediately bought them and left.. i actually looked at the shorts before she was even in the store but decided not to get them until later when i looked them up online and saw they were regularly $50. they looked brand new and goodwill was selling them for $5... when i went back to get them they weren't there but i happened to see them in this woman's basket. pretty sure she was a bargain shopper. i'm fucking pathetic.

edit: i still feel bad about doing this but another part of me doesn't give a fuck because her basket was full of clothes. i'm willing to bet that she doesn't even wear them (considering she bought men's shorts) but instead re-sells them. out off all those shorts that one was the only one she picked up. she probably did the same damn thing and looked them up. and no i didn't change my mind because i want to ""flex"" by wearing expensive stuff. at least i'll actually fuckin wear them unlike her.

"i tried to miscarry my baby and hurt her permanently. when i was 15, i got myself pregnant unintentionally. i was a very promiscuous horny teenager and i wasn't exactly safe about it. sometimes i used condoms, sometimes i didn't. i got really worried when i started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so i took a pregnancy test and what i feared was true, i was pregnant.


i had no idea how to react to this. for one i was utterly terrified and i wanted to get rid of it. in a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. i have very christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but i knew they would actually love to raise this kid. however, i hated the idea. i had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and i just didn't want a child.


i guess i'm making excuses, even now. i started a smoking habit very promptly, since i'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. i barely ate at all, and if i did i threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if i was trying to get rid of a fever. it didn't work. i gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. i gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. my parents were surprisingly supportive and i got the help i needed for my eating disorder and i still go to regular therapy. i just had to get it off my chest.


edit: i've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. it was hard writing it, and as a result i focused more on what happened than my emotions. i want to make it clear that i really really regret my actions. it's very hard to live with what i've done, and when i was 17 i attempted suicide because i simply couldn't handle it any longer. what i've done to my child tears me apart every day. i still have nightmares, i still can't sleep at night. i can't tell you how many times i've wished and prayed to go back in time. however, i've focused on improving myself through therapy and i am training to be a nurse to help children. i know that doesn't make up for it, but i'm trying hard to be better.


edit 2: this is not the way to deal with this situation. first of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. if you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. if you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. speak to your doctor or teacher you world. if you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. don't do what i did. getting pregnant is not the end of the world. don't let it be the end of yours.

"in high school, i forged all of my report cards. back in high school, i wasn't a great student and report cards always got me in a lot of trouble. around the 9th grade i started intercepting the mail, scanning in my report card on my windows pc, then carefully changing all the grades and comments from my teachers using text & numbers that were already on the page. afterward, i'd very carefully print it out so everything was in the correct spots, then folded it up and put it back in the envelope. 

at one point in time, my mother was corresponding with one of my teachers via email to track my progress. i went as far as to make an email address that matched my teachers, just from a different domain and would delete the real emails from my teacher and forge fake emails that made me look better.

somehow, i never got caught",11
"i took the most necessary items from a lady's shopping cart in an act of petty revenge.. i was walking down the aisle and she rounded the corner and blocked me, then left the cart in my way while she popped back around the corner for something off the shelf.

i took the butter and milk from her cart and returned them to the shelves, so that she will get home without her essentials.

this served no purpose, she will not learn anything, it was just petty and i am ashamed of it.",11
"i guess i am my brothers keeper. i used to watch over my little brother (who at the time we didn't know has aspergers) when he was at school. kids would always pick on him and when he came home with bruises, i ditched school (i was in high school and he was in middle school) and snuck onto campus during recess and lunch times, but always stayed a ways away. 

i saw some little asshat push my brother down and watched as he got back up, picked up his books and walked away, even though the boy was following him and smacking the back of his head. after my brother made it into the classroom, i ran up, grabbed the kid by the back of the neck and without thinking, head butted him. once he started to cry, i pulled him in and told him if he ever lays a hand on that little boy again, i'd break every last one of his sad little bones. i've never told anyone about doing that. 

after school, i watched my brother begin to walk home and the little shits friend walked up to him, yelled something about ""some dumb older girl"" (i can only assume he meant me) and he pushed my brother into the street and a car had to slam on its breaks to avoid hitting him. 

at that point, i lost it. i pulled my brother onto the sidewalk, made sure he was okay and told him not to move. i ran over to the little shit (i didn't care that he was younger. not one bit), grabbed him by his hair and yanked him to the ground and started beating the ever loving crap out of him. at some point, i broke his arm. 

the driver of the car that almost hit my brother had called the police and pulled me off of him, but backed me up 100% and told the officer the truth about what he saw. i got insanely lucky. the police officer told me he has a little sister with autism and he probably would have done the same thing. 

didn't even get punished in the slightest, was just told to take my brother home and to promise never to hit anyone again. (the best i could give was to never get caught hitting anyone again). 

we stopped by the 7/11 on the way home and i got us both some ice cream. i don't know if he remembers that day now but i'd still do it all over again in a heartbeat. ",11

"i framed my mother's ex husband when i was 5. so, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. later on in life, i found out that he was even worse than i thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. for example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the three jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. he was that kind of guy. 

so, when i was a kid, i always got up much much earlier than everyone else. i can't remember why, but it was probably just so i could watch cartoons in peace. one morning, i went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. it was closed, but i got curious. 

i opened it and i was playing with it, when i had a thought. obviously i can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at meat-head-mcdonald. i immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (now, i know that i bled so much bc i have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) i started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with dick-wipe, and they saw what happened. 

i told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and i had put my hand down on it on accident. this led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and micro-penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open. 

so yeah. i still have the lovely scar on the middle of my hand to remind me that i was more of an evil genius when i was a child than i ever will be again. fun.

"i used to eat my coworkers apple chips at work, then tell him that i was allergic to apples so he wouldn't accuse me.. just to be clear, this wasn't because i was particularly hungry, its because my coworker was an absolute asshole. he was really creepy toward the girls in the office and always said some pretty weirdly racist shit to our other coworker who was from mexico. he was just a crude, horribly annoying person who seemingly took enjoyment out of making everyone around him uncomfortable. he was like a mix of todd packer from the office and tony soprano. he always brought these apple chips into work to eat for lunch, and occasionally i would go in, take the apple chips, and go to the nearby park and eat them for lunch. he would go around asking everyone if they took the chips and would act all pissed off because he knew someone took them. 

instead of just flat out telling him i'm allergic to apples, i put on a little show. he was eating his chips 2 days before i started to take them, and i asked if i could have one, and i took one and almost took a bite, then said ""these aren't apple flavored are they?"" and he said they were, then i quickly put it back on the plate and went to go wash my hands and i said i was allergic. much more believable than me just flat out telling him.

"i saw a women get raped and didn't call the police. she was killed afterwards.. this was in 2007, in chicago. i used to live in a cruddy neighborhood with a lot of abandoned warehouses and such. 

i woke up to the sounds of this weird screaming and yelling in spanish coming from the alleyway near my house. i had no idea what she was saying, but i looked over, and a girl was bent over backwards getting fucked. i just figured she was yelling in happiness or something loudly, and closed my window. about 10-15 minutes later, i heard her scream way louder, like a lot. i looked over out the window again and she was gone, and the guy was still there. i had no idea what had happened. i just closed my window again and went back to bed. 

next day, i woke up to cop cars all throughout the block. i figured something bad had happened, but i really had no idea what, and i was scared to ask because i felt i might be pressured to be a witness or something. i just stayed in my house and looked out my window. 

i would end up searching newspapers and internet for the next few days trying to find out what happened. i found out. the guy was a john, she was a prostitute. he broke her arm in the car, dragged her to the alleyway and raped her, then took his baseball bat and started hitting her over and over again. she managed to escape into the street, but he found her and bashed her head in with the baseball bat and killed her. he was arrested with a bloody baseball bat in his apartment and some heroin. 

i could have called the police the first time when i heard her yelling and saw them fucking, and none of this would have happened. cops typically take 10~ minutes to respond to stuff like that, and they were in that alleyway for at least 15 minutes. the house next to me was a vacant, so i was the only one who could have called the cops.

"when i was 19 years old i lied about having a summer job and smoked weed at a parking lot 3 days a week for 8 hours a day.. at first, my apologies in advance for any grammar mistakes, english is my second language. 

so, i grew up with very kind and sweet parents. we are a wealthy family but the one thing my parents are obsessed about is working, their whole life is just about work. and in my teen years i was the most lazy person ever, never did anything, school was way too easy everything just went well my whole life without effort. 

when i turned 19 and it was summer, the perfect moment to just relax, smoke weed and drink beers with my friends. but no. my parents insisted that i should get a summer job, probably because they were just annoyed by me doing nothing. so, i did what they said and applied for a job at a local restaurant as pizza delivery guy. the owner was a total jerk and insulted me all the time, after 3 days my shift was over and i never came back. told my parents about the situation and of course they were not happy.

2 weeks passed and i still haven't got a job and they began to annoy the frick out of me, they didn't care about anything else then me getting a fricking summer job. finally i came to the decision to just lie about having a job at a storage facility. they were so happy for me so i just continued the lie. 

i went off for work, drove my car to the train station and put my car in the parking lot and just smoked weed, listen to the radio and watched some movies i downloaded on my laptop. i told my parents my boss paid me in cash every month, i had a student loan at that time my parents didn't knew about, since i was 18+ that is allowed in my country without my parents consent, and that was exactly the right amount of money i would get for those hours i went ""working"" for. 

i did that for 3 months straight, even when school started again. i went off every saturday and watched movies and smoked weed. they still haven't figured it out yet.

it was a familly buisness and they were very mean and  have no patience. i ordered a delivery, it came 1h later and cold. called him out about it . dude got mad, start yelling and refused to take it back. he throwed the change at me and stormed away. i called his father (pizza owner) to complain, and he told me that his kid dont get mad if he wasnt right, and told me to put the pizza in the microwave and hung up. i was mad af.  i decided to wait untill i cool off and think about what to do. so the next morning, i called the pizza from a phonebooth and ordered almost 80$ worth of pizza. i gave them the adress of the appartement next to me wich was empty. i turned off my tv so i can hear him coming. he came more than an hour later and start knocking the door. of course no one responded. he insisted by knocking loudly. so i opened my door, and sees him with a ton  of pizza. i just laughed and closed my door. he automaticaly knew that it was me but couldnt prove it. i could hear him yelling, insulting while leaving the building...
that day was satisfying af. i ordered domino to celebrate.

"i shit in a mason jar and left it in my friends pantry.. here we go. 


about 13 years ago my 19 year old self was partying at a friends house. there was probably a good 20-25 people packed inside this 1000sqf house. 

i had been drinking mikes hard lemonade and tampon blender benders all night long. full disclosure; i have an allergy involving certain alcohols that can cause severe hives, swollen throat, and intense diarrhea. i was 19, and stupid. 

anyways, i was chatting with my gal pal at the time and felt the inevitable groan of my stomach. 

""shit"" i thought. figuratively and literally. 

i asked where the bathroom was, and she pointed down the hall. 

i squeezed myself through the teenage crowd only to find a ridiculously long line of women waiting to use the toilet. 

my bowels were screaming. 

the cramps were intensifying. 

i recalled seeing a toilet closet in the basement of the house once before and decided to take my chances. i darted down the stairs all while puckering my pooper with all the strength in me. 

it was dark so i flipped the light switch and saw the porcelain throne glowing in the corner of the room. i slam the door behind me and shove my pants down around my ankles. i make a swift penguin waddle over to the toilet. 

to my surprise, the toilet isn't connected to the plumbing! it's just sitting in the corner of the room. a failed attempt at a bathroom remodel, i had put myself in a perilous poo-position with no escape.  

people saw me come down here, there's no way i could poo in the toilet and get away with it. 

by now anus was on fire. i could barely hold it in much longer. 

i panicked. 

i scanned the room and noticed an open mason jar filled with potpourri with the lid laying beside it on a shelf. 

my mind was made up. 

i snatched the mason jar from the shelf and promptly dumped the potpourri into the empty toilet bowl. 

ever so carefully i placed the mason jar on the floor of the bathroom and popped a squat over it. spreading my cheeks and with surgical precision, i shat my brains out in that jar. i filled that sucker to the brim. i released the kraken of anal sighs and never felt such relief before in my life. 

but what now? what do i do? i can't leave it in here! 

i hear my friends calling me from upstairs that they were wanting to leave. i needed an escape plan, now! 

quickly i pulled up my pants (wiping was not an option, but i'd pinched off like 99.99% of my shit, so it was *clean enough*) and placed the lid on the mason jar. it was warm. so warm. still unsure of what to do next, i hide the jar under my hoodie and exit the bathroom as if nothing happened. 

""what were you doing down there?"" my friend asked. 

""just freshening up"" i said, in absolute horror that she may notice my mason jar shit smuggling. 

""hurry up, we're all in the kitchen waiting to leave"" she barks. 

i swim through the crowd of people to the kitchen to meet my friends. they're all crowded around the pantry door which was next to the door to the garage. 

""there you are!"" they holler as they open the door to the garage. 

here's my chance. the door to the garage was blocking the visual to the pantry. 

i did it. i slide the smuggled shit jar out from under my sweater and place it next to identical jars in the pantry. and promptly left with my friends. 

to this day, i wonder. i wonder with so much wonderment that i wonder how i've never been caught. 

did they ever locate this jar and open it? was it assumed beef stew? was it tasted? smelled? tossed? 

i regret this. but i was desperate. 

this is my poo-fession.

"i used to be a white supremacist - please read the whole thing before posting. about a year ago i joined a group of men that advocate for white nationalism and other far right nonsense. too be honest i didn't care or like any of these people in the slightest. the only reason  joined them was because some of  my friends were going to that ""side"" of the political spectrum and they were getting angry about stupid political shit like i was. i did a lot of crazy stuff like vandalism and basically getting drunk with other skin heads and aryan brotherhood drug dealers. i slide down this kind of spectrum, i acted like a fool and made myself look stupid. eventually after a few crazy events happened i stopped talking to my white nationalist friend and started doing my own thing for a while through mostly work. i got this crazy idea to actually go to a synagogue, a mosque , and a church just out of fun. when i went to these places almost all of those people treated me very well, including an elderly jewish couple. they treated me like a part of their own family and introduced me to their kids. the muslims treated me the same way and even gave me some free classes about the quran. but i think the worst part of all was when i went to a catholic church and i saw every race on the face of the planet in this small town i used to live in. and i felt so bad about this whole thing. because i had judged a lot of these people before they even knew me. but in all honesty i'm sorry i did some bad things to these people and i don't want any harm to them. i guess i'm glad that god helped me realize what i did was wrong and i don't want anyone to do the same things i did. but again i'm sorry for what i did i hope some of you can forgive me.",11

"i sold a plastic bottle cap to a mentally handicapped kid when i was 8.. at the age of 8, i decided i wanted to make money for whatever reason goes through the mind of a kid. 

there was this mentally impaired kid living in my street, who was always very nice to the neighbourhood and waved her hand with a big smile to everyone. she could barely talk intelligibly but could understand simple words.

so one day, going through the mess of my bedroom i found a plastic bottle cap. i walked up to the kid and told her it is a very important object and that her parents really need it. her parents would be really happy to have it. they would be angry if she loses it. 

now, for mentally handicapped kids, their parents, their house, their neighbourhood is the only world they know. it is the limit of their universe, this is all they got. they are innocent. they cannot imagine what being mean or dishonest is. 

i told her she needed to give me coins to get the cap. she came back with a bunch of coins in her hand. she looked so happy. she couldn't count, so i took all of it. 

it has been 20 years now, and i have deep remorses for what i did. taking advantage of an impaired and innocent child who cannot imagine people can be deceiving. i can imagine her cheering that ridiculous cap, like its gold. showing it to her parents because she loves them. 

the kid has passed away because of her disease and i will never be able to repair what i did.

i thought i would buy the cap back from her parents. whatever cap will do, even if it's not the one i gave her. but it would sound like nonsense to them. too long a story to explain. they probably don't even know this ever happened. but i do.",11
"i purposely damage food packaging at work. i work at a large retail chain, and we were purging the whole grocery section in the stockroom. this included getting rid of things that weren't sold there anymore, was expired, or otherwise unsellable. as long as it was still safe to eat, we donated it to a food bank.

so once i got to the top shelves of product, i would ""accidentally"" drop casepacks of food, crushing boxes so couldn't go out onto the salesfloor, and would have to be donated. if management knew, i'd definitely lose my job.",11
"i cheated on my exam in a way i never thought was possible. this was about four years ago in high school. now i am from poland and we had a test of english idioms. i considered myself quite good at english so i never really paid attention to when the exams were scheduled as i managed to get good marks without studying at all.

the idiom one, however, caught me off guard. i knew about two out of ten examples and i just wasn't okay with the mark that i was gonna get. i quickly wrote down the idioms on a separate paper and never handed in the original one. the teacher then proceeded to mark the tests at his desk and that's when i wrote my answers on that separate sheet of paper with the help of my notebook.

as i finished i approached my teacher and asked him some typical questions about my marks and etc. that required him to look at his computer screen. at that very moment i dropped my perfectly written paper under his chair and returned to my own desk. about 15 minutes later i watched him pick it up with slight confusion and eventually he assumed that he had dropped it before, exactly as i had planned.

i ended up getting the best mark and honestly am still proud of myself for handling it like that. i've learned the idioms too.",11
"i took $30 out of my colleague's farewell gift contribution when i found out she blocked me on facebook.. 
so i (22f) work at a big law firm as a paralegal. my colleague (30f) is also a paralegal. we've both been working there for 2 years. she can be dramatic and gossip-y but other than that she's good at what she does. 

she started treating me different ever since my proposal to go part-time got accepted by the executive (due to studies). a lawyer that i'm close with even told me that my colleague said that i suck up to the lawyers (idk how true this is. maybe it was just a misunderstanding? i'm just kind to everyone). 

so she got accepted in a different job last week and she'll be leaving soon. we're all contributing to get her a farewell gift and she really wants this expensive make up set from sephora (she can't afford expensive make up because she lives paycheck to paycheck) .well this week i found out that she blocked me on facebook for no apparent reason. i thought two can play at that game. the next day at work, i took back my $30 contribution towards her gift and we're now short on her make up set. nobody knows how much i donated because i'm the one who is in charge of counting the money and collecting donations. 

hey kate, you're getting a gift card to a department store instead.

edit: i took my own $30 contribution back which i donated in the first place. yes i know it's better to kill with kindness, but i'm not going to put my  own hard earned money to reward someone who attempted to destroy my image in a field which i will be potentially working in.

"i once trucked a girl in high school and it keeps me up at night. in high school i played football and i was pretty tall and big. when walking to classes it actually kind of sucked because i had to stop to let people go into doors so i wouldn't run into kids because i could accidentally knock somebody over. 

i had another friend on team who walked with me to class and we would occasionally fuck around in the hallway by pushing each other, just dumb shit. we were messing around when he pushes me when we're making a turn down the hallway, and i backup and feel something against me. 

i look down an a poor girl, who was probably a freshman, is laying on the ground. absolutely terrified. i go down to help her up and my friend still doesn't understand what's happening and thinks we're still messing around, so he pushes me again and i almost ended up trampling her. she got up on her own and rushed down the hallway probably with tears in her eyes because i had just knocked her into a brick wall and onto the ground. 

i never got reported to a teacher so i'm assuming she had no injuries. this wasn't the last time something like this happened. i was walking to class after lunch when a friend came over and pushed me as a joke. i said ""get away from me"" at the exact same time a girl accidentally hit me while walking by, looked at me super offended and walked off.",11
"i learned something about my mom's past, and i feel like i've stolen something from her.. for context, i'm a 25yo woman.

last month, i was at my parent's house. i was helping my mom with something when i noticed a piece of paper barely sticking out of a folder. all i could see was a title that ended with the phrase ""as rape survivor"" and something that looked like my sister's name next to the right margin on the second line.

yes, i know, i shouldn't have read it. but i dare you not to do the same in my position.

there was a split second where i considered pretending i'd never seen it. but selfishly, i thought i \*had\* to know.

and naively, i thought that whatever i could imagine could be worse than what had happened.

after all, my mother was and is a popular likable extrovert who drank like a fish in college and always had a date to dances. and well, norms have changed. there are experiences that might seem like rape in hindsight that would not have been considered so at the time.

i was expecting a story involving fuzzy boundaries and fuzzy memories, the edges worn down by the decades passed since. it wasn't that i wanted to invalidate her experience precisely, but mentally minimize it so that i could neatly consign it to the same place where i keep stories about her grad school roommates.

until i started reading.

it was the kind of rape that people often imagine when they talk about rape. behind her apartment. by two strangers. at gunpoint. on her 24th birthday. my mother, the woman who believes that people are fundamentally good. my mother, the most empathetic and emotionally intelligent person i've ever met. my mother, the woman who leaves our front door unlocked at least 80% of the time. she was raped at gunpoint when she was six months younger than i am now.

she talked about how it tested her support network - how her new boyfriend dumped her and how people—female and male alike—asked what she was wearing. how men who had been casually interested in her suddenly treated her like she was infected.

the whole essay made me feel nauseous.

true to form, her essay framed the aftermath reactions as a valuable relationship litmus test. she severed ties with some friends and drew closer to others.

i can't help feeling like i failed the litmus test.

by picking up that paper and by making assumptions before i'd even started reading. i betrayed her and stole something that belonged to her.",11
"i used to throw out food so my mom had to cook again. when i was a kid i used to live alone with my mother, she always cooked more than necessary at lunch so she don't need to cook again for dinner. food usually was enough even for the next day lunch. i hated this, in my mind, there was no need for that. she was just lazy. i threw out the food so she had to cook a new one, this last for a month or so, obviously she realized what i was doing but never said a word, she just took the ""hint"" and cooked less.looking back, she was so fucking busy. single mother having to take care of a child and work at the same time. honestly, this is not something i cared that much until last week when she died, everything came back. all the shit i've done in the past that made our life difficult.",11
"i stopped attending a class, lied about turning in a final and still passed.. i was reading through a few posts on this sub and found one that reminded me about a class i took in college.

&#x200b;

back in my junior year of college i took a class with a professor that i really did not like. he was so disorganized, absent minded and really didn't teach anything. the kind of professor that tells you to watch youtube videos instead of actually teaching you the subject. it took him weeks to grade anything and i don't even think he read them. it seemed like he was just coasting until retirement. 

anyway, i flew out to see my grandma one week for her 90th birthday. i missed a few classes and missed a few youtube lessons. well the following week my grandma passed so i flew back out for her funeral in turn missing a few more classes. i was really far behind and really had no clue what we were working on, flunked the midterm and missed a big project. at this point i just gave up and reserved myself to failure and retake it in the summer. didn't show up to any other classes. 

at the end of the semester he emailed me regarding the final project and final test. he congratulated me on a great job with the group project. really weird since i haven't been to class in months and was definitely not part of a group project. he was also wondering if i had turned in the final paper. i emailed him back and told him how happy i was that he enjoyed the project and i had definitely turned in my paper. 

well i don't know if he wanted to cover his tracks and pretend he didn't lose my test or whether he didn't give a shit but when i checked my final grades for the semester, i had passed with a high c.

"i stole a book from the library page by page, then glued the pieces together at home. i was about 10 and i was addicted to read encyclopedias. i could spend hours learning about all sorts of stuff, staring at the illustrations and photos, and of course, smelling the books. however, i could get my fix at my local library only as my parents could barely afford food for us, let alone buying fancy books. so, i became a regular guest at the kids/teenager section of the library.

one day i couldn't get there in time, so i only had about half an hour to spend before closing time. not just that, but they also had a brand new, 400 page encyclopedia waiting for me on the shelf. it was love on the first sight. i felt awful, because i knew that i couldn't do much reading in such a little time, and then there was this lovely smelling book with a montage of astronauts, cars and magnificent landscapes on the front cover just begging me to read it. sadly, books like those were not borrowable and time was ticking.

i thought about 'taking it', but it was just enormous and i wasn't. i wasn't a bad boy either, i told myself. but what if i just take a few pages? that surely won't hurt anyone, and noone will notice it missing. that's what i did. the book was binded in a way, that i could carefully rip about 5 pages out in one go. i wrapped the pages around my foot, slipped them in my socks, covered my socks with my pants and i just casually walked out. the first time i actually said 'thank you very much' with a big smile to the librarian and she gave me that awkward 'what the heck are you talking about?' look. my 10 years old mind quickly realised how stupid i was to say that and i, maybe even my parents could be in jail for this, so i just rushed out, sweating and with my heart jumping out of my chest.

originally i wanted to return the pages at the next visit to the library. but as i was sitting on my bed at home, reading about the wildlife in africa (the only content i got at the time), i came up with the masterplan of repeating the process until i get every page. and the plan was working! not just that, but i improved on the technique. i wrapped pages around my feet, around my arms (had to wear long sleeve for that) and also kept a stack on my back, tucked carefully in my pants. i could get about 20-25 pages in just one day. i remember walking slowly like a robot on my way out as i didn't want to crush the pages too much. i couldn't bend in any direction because the pages were holding my limbs tight.

after several visits to the library the encyclopedia began to visibly shrink. so i got some paper from the photocopy room and replaced the missing pages with blank ones. my last visit was the sketchiest, because i had to take the trophy somehow. by trophy i mean the hard cover with the astronauts on. there was no way to wrap it like i did with the pages and it was too big to hide it anywhere on me. but i was so close to victory, i couldn't let it go. i had the shiny cover in its full glory, in my hand. i put it under my t-shirt, on my back. hands in my pocket, trying to hold the cover with my elbows. i was scared to the bone that they will catch me and send me to jail. i checked my reflection in the window. i looked like a terrified lady gaga with fake shoulderpads. but i was also shameless by this time, i knew i was an awful person. it was nearly 5 o'clock and every librarygoer left, the librarians were doing their closing up routines so the front desk was abandoned. i just walked out without anyone noticing me.

i glued all the pages and the cover together at home. the book was nowhere near as majestic as before, but i loved it anyway. i have never ever stolen anything else in my life, and i am so sorry for this.",11

all if it just feels so...numb and empty.

so i grabbed my cat, gave him to my neighbor, told him ill be out for a few hours. went back to my unit, tied a noose right by the already set up hook near my window. took a plastic chair. slid my head inside the rope. 

and then a knock. 

it was my neighbor. it was just an hour in since i gave my cat over, he was knocking furiously and shouting that i had to get him back. i hid my setup and cleaned up, hurried towards the door. he had scratches all over his arms and a big ass scab right across the left side of his cheek. my cat apparently started acting up, crying super loudly and was scratching furiously at the door out of nowhere. i apologized and asked if he wanted help with his wounds but he declined. i went back in and decided to sleep it off. 

update:

the amount of support and love i've been receiving is honestly surprising and overwhelming and i thank every single one of you guys who made the effort to send me a message or comment their experiences and support, i promise that i'll reply to every single one. i had absolutely no intention for this post to boom, i really just wanted to get this off my chest and even now everything just feels like a blurry mess i'm not sure if i'm even actually making any sense at all. and to clear things up i'm unsure how my post history has any connection to the confession above. i live in a completely different time zone (the philippines) from the (im assuming) majority of the people on here and idk i just seriously don't have the energy to try and defend myself at this point. 

i do realize that i am actually quite privileged. but of course before pulling the ""i'm suffering way more than you, suck it up you ungrateful cunt"" card on me. do realize that every single person's hardships are valid and not all individuals are alike. we have different levels of emotional capacity/stability/whatever. i'm sorry life's been hard on you but that's not a free pass to invalidate someone elses experiences. what you know might only be what you see or what you've been shown on the surface.

i'd like the thank the redditor who gave this post a reddit gold, truly appreciated. and also, for fellow suicide survivors, thank you for sharing your stories, thoughts and insights.

i feel like i'm not expressing the gratitude that i feel as much as i think i should and i wish everything in my head were more concrete and i apologize. ",11

"i managed to convince an entire park that i'm deaf.. i was playing basketball at my local park by myself when a group  gentlemen walked up to me and began asking me for ""nics"" or if i had any ""nics"" (later found out it was short for nicotine or cigarettes) not knowing what that was and not wanting to bother asking what it was, i for whatever reason blurted out ""i'm deaf i can't hear you"" whilst talking like a deaf person and pointing at my ear. what can i say, i just didn't wanna talk to them. for the rest of my time there that day more people began showing up, and every time they stepped onto the court the gentlemen from earlier would inform them i was deaf and i wouldn't be able to hear them. i figured i'm already in this deep i my as well keep going. so for the rest of the day i was the deaf guy playing basketball, talking like a weirdo, and making bullshit hand signals pretending not to hear anyone. even took a few balls to the face because i ""couldn't hear"" them saying ""look out!"" 

i left the park that day thinking that was a one time thing and i wouldn't ever have to do it again. however i go to the park quite often and apparently so does everyone else from day one. and every time i'm there they tell a new group of people and the cycle repeats itself. and i guess with my bullshit sign language i've sold it quite well because to some of the park staff, regular basketball players, and a few miscellaneous individuals think i'm just that deaf guy that goes to the park. even though my hearing is fine. 

i know it's only a matter of time until someone calls out my fake voice, bullshit sign language, or i slip up. but until then i'm kinda just stuck being this deaf dude because i'm too embarrassed to tell the truth at this point. 

update: i've continued going to the park every day, a few of the guys that i have become friends with and that have been very respectful of my disability asked if we could exchange numbers just to hang out some time. so far we've hung out 3 times. went to couple of baseball games and out to eat. and one even invited me to his wedding in january. i also no longer fear running into another deaf person as they may give me away. this is because in order to keep this up i'm proud to say i've extensively expanded my asl knowledge, and can string full real sentences that are no longer made up gestures. so i don't really know how much longer i'll do this, maybe even forever. perhaps this friend group will always know me as the deaf guy that goes to the park every day. and although i feel like an asshole for lying to people who i truly consider friends for so long, i think i'll embrace the good that came of all this and keep on signing.

"i called cps on my daughter and she is facing losing custody of her baby.. for context, my daughter is 15 years old. she has been living in my house with her 2 month old son since he was born, and i recently reported her to child services. she has a case opened and the case manager is on the verge of recommending removal (several factors at play). when she first told me she was pregnant i told her she either got an abortion, gave the baby up for adoption, or she could have the baby but i would give her nothing but what i am legally required to. she had only recently started high school, and i will be the first to admit i took the news *exceptionally* hard. i was scared out of my mind for her. my wife had always kept things open and told me she'd taken her to our local health department to talk about birth control (our daughter opted out and her doctor was in support) so we got her a large bag of condoms in the event she were to choose to become sexually active. she was prepared, she had the knowledge, she refused the birth control and ended up pregnant. honestly, we couldn't even afford to support her *and* the baby if we wanted to. 

my wife hasn't worked since 2011 and her disability hardly makes a dent in our expenses. we finally had to downsize our home and sell my wife's car just a few months before my daughter announced her pregnancy. i was working hours that just weren't sustainable and my wife needed me to help her at home. about 5 months into the pregnancy (my daughter insisted on raising the baby) her boyfriend moved away to live with family in another state and didn't tell her. she found out when the relatives made a post on social media about how excited they were he was there and then she was slowly blocked by the rest of the family. she hasn't heard from him since, he has never met his son and the family has never reached out.

 i told my daughter when she refused to abort that i would in no uncertain terms support her child, that i would love and treat them like a grandparent is expected to but i would not be financially responsible for it's care or keeping and if she could not find a way to provide, i would call the appropriate authorities to intervene. she dropped out but only got a part time job, was unmotivated to get her ged or diploma through adult ed (i actually offered to pay for her class fee and test fees) and expected that my wife would take care of the baby while she was at work. she would often forget and miss a feed, refused to pump milk regularly and got a major breast infection, would often delay changing to save money on diapers, it was not a good situation. my wife and i of course were there behind her and have been using formula and making sure he was getting nutrients, but my daughter was not nurturing this child in any competent manner and while not malicious, was often neglectful of the baby. it wasn't easy to make the call, but it was necessary and something i had long prepared to do. my daughter hates me, my wife is empathetic but has stood by my decision from the start, and i am both uncertain and at peace with my choices. part of me feels like i did the best i could for everyone involved and part of me knows i betrayed my daughter on a horrible way and part of me knows that this baby deserves better than what she ( and really *we*) could provide. 

edit: i did not realize that this would blow up over night. i would like to clarify a few things, though. i did not ever allow that baby to suffer. i did say my wife and i were going behind her with formula to make sure he was gaining his weight back, i didn't think i'd have to also clarify that we did indeed supply more diapers when we realized what she was doing. also, we have not neglected our daughter nor have we treated her to such cold indignities like neglecting her medical care. we did get her infection treated promptly, she had prenatal and postnatal care. contrary to what most people believe, i am not doing this out of anger. i am sad for my daughter and deeply disappointed that this is what life has come to but we cannot afford to raise her and a baby. i made this incredibly clear to her, and told her the consequences of her inability to provide once the baby got here would be child service involvement. we have not allowed either our daughter or her baby to wallow in filth or suffer, but we will not continue to provide the care for her infant, and so i had to call the only people i knew who would help. i won't pretend that i have made all the best choices or that i am perfect, but i am not heartless or abusive.

"i choked out an 8th grader 13 years ago. some background info needed. i come from a mixed race muslim family and grew up in a small post-9/11 midwestern town so there was a lot of bullying towards me and my siblings.

durring a school football game my younger brother was watching, one of the guys that bullied us, lets call him chad (who was in the same grade as me), threw a water bottle at my lil bros face. my brother (a 7th grader) had to walk home with a swollen eye and my mom had to put ice on it to get the swelling to go down. he wouldn't tell her who did it but he told me. this fliped a switch in my head.

my brother was a bullied a lot more than me on account he was younger, slightly effeminate and had dark skin like our father. meanwhile i was a year older, tall for my age and white like my mom so i didn't have it close as bad as him.

anyway. chad would leave school out one of the back exits to save time on his walk home. i knew nobody else left that way so when school got out the next monday i followed him. i ran after him and started chocking him from behind like i had seen in action movies. maybe it was because of the adrenalin but i started screaming all kinds of crap at him. the cliche ""dont mess with my family"" stuff. 

i left him unconscious behind the school and went home. this was the first and last time i used violence against someone. i never told anyone and neither did he so i wasn't punished for this. 

chad turned up to school the next day and everything was back to normal. the only thing that changed was that chad and his friends stopped harassing me and my bro.

to this day i still think he had it coming.

edit: if i'm being honest while i was choking chad and screaming at him i was also balling my eyes out. yea...fighting didn't suit me

edit 2: i was the same age as the other kid. sorry i didnt mean to make the title of this post so confusing",11
"i mercilessly bullied 5 people in high school. 3/5 of them killed themselves.. i am in my 40s now, and i don't deserve the life i have. i stepped on the backs of my classmates to make myself feel better about myself. i was bullied harshly in school, and had the shit beat out of me on a daily basis until i hit puberty. then i suddenly grew into a monster. i towered over everybody at school. i also channeled my anger into working out, and became even bigger. i was a huge, ogre of a person. i hated everybody. i had so much angst built up from my own bullying. my former bullies, being the manipulative cowards that they were (i see this in retrospect, but didn't see it at the time), befriended me. and we pretty much held a reign of terror over the school. i fed on the newfound respect from my former enemies. 

&#x200b;

we preyed on the weak. there were about 5 nerds that i personally tormented harshly. i joined facebook a couple months ago to see what became of them. i had hopes that they were able to live happy lives despite my awful treatment of them. one i knew died suspiciously in high school, but it turns out it was a suicide that was covered up. two more killed themselves right after high school graduation. the 4th lives alone in a trailer and appears to be crazy. the 5th person actually turned their life around and married the head cheerleader several years after graduation. so at least there's that.

&#x200b;

i wish i could apologize to the remaining two, but it would be so trite and meaningless. plus, it would probably re-traumatize them, having to see me again, or having to think about those events again.

&#x200b;

i suck, i'm sorry, and sometimes i feel like i should off myself too. you know, to balance the scales of life. i have been tormented my entire adult life for being the bully that i was, when i really should have been an advocate for the bullied instead. i mean, i already knew how it felt! instead of sticking up for people and beating the bullies asses, i, like a bitch, joined them. i can never forgive myself for that.

"when i was a kid, i tried to poison my entire family.. i'm the middle child and one day i just got fed up because i felt like nobody would take my side. my parents favored my siblings most of the time so i took the little black bottle at the back of the cupboard (which i thought was poison because it was small and black. i know, i'm stupid.) and fucking poured it all over the mushroom soup for dinner. i was smirking all throughout dinner waiting for them to start choking. turns out it was just vanilla extract.",11
"ejaculated on my grandmother's face.. one night when i was 13/14 my grandmother had come to visit us. she slept in my bed and i slept on the couch. at this point in my life, pretty much every night i would wait for everyone to go to sleep and then i would jack off. even though i was on the couch, i still decided to do it. for some reason, in my horned-up state, i got really turned on by the idea of ejaculating on my grandmother's face. so, without really thinking, i went into my room and while she was still asleep i quietly jacked off next to her and then finished on her cheek/neck area. 

after i finished i left as quickly and quietly as i could and went back to the lougeroom. i have no idea if she knows what i did. this happened a decade ago and i still hate myself every time i think about it. i don't know what i was thinking.

"my family doesn't know i'm graduating this year. the title says it all. when i asked around about adult education, and asked my parents opinion, they said it's a waste of time and money. they can be very... judgmental. they have no education and 'they turned out fine', that kind of thinking. i was very upset, but i really wanted to study psychology and help people. so i started a study without anyone knowing. in my country education is very affordable, so i didn't have financial problems. i failed a lot, and it wasn't easy, but after 7 long years i can finally say that i'm graduating. but i can't say it. not yet. i'll tell them when i'm actually working, so i have solid proof it wasn't a waste. it's very hard, and i know they'll be upset, but i really don't need to be dragged down now i'm almost there. i see them every week, and i have lied to their faces for 7 years straight, another few months won't make it worse. i need to tell someone though, so here i am. i'm not completely sure if this belongs here, but i don't know where else to put it


edit: thanks for all the support! it feels amazing to finally share this. i'm going to try and clear a few things up. i'm actually a 34 year old woman. i'm planning on starting my own independent practice, and have already modified part of my house to function as such, so i can start right away in august. i will update when i told them, probably the end of august, possibly september ",11
"i did heroin for two years when i was 17-18 and not a soul knew except for my dealer.. i had a very strange introduction to heroin. i got sort of tricked into it. i had snorted pills before, and the person told me it was an opiate when we did it at a party. this was in 2002, before a lot of pills and such were laced. this party was a sketchy party, i knew almost nobody there at all, it was mostly older people from new york. except when i did it, it was like 100 times stronger than any opiate i had ever tried before. it felt mindbogglingly amazing. i obviously wish i never did it. i was super drunk at the time and was basically down to try anything. 

i found out it was heroin while i was on it because the guys friend was yelling at him for basically lying to me and saying it was just an opiate, but at the time i didn't give a single shit. i was in blissful heaven, just laying down on that couch. 

i was a popular girl at my high school. not like the mean popular ones from heathers, i was more like the main girl from clueless. i did drugs and partied but i got good grades and presented myself as the preppy good girl to all the adults around me. i was very well liked by people, and was friendly to people. i threw parties which everyone liked. i was involved in clubs and sports teams. even to *me*, it was just weird that someone *like me* would ever try something like heroin. 

but i was hooked, right away. i contacted this guy micah who had dropped out of our school, i knew he sold. he had no friends in the school, he barely even spoke english. i told him i was getting it for a friend who had a horrible disease where they could barely walk, good excuse right? anyways, i did the same amount as before. very, very small amounts. 

at first i tried to keep it down to once a week. i knew how bad it was. my parents were good, normal successful parents and they would murder me if they ever found out. but i got obsessed with how good it felt. addictive doesn't even begin to describe it. nothing felt even close to the feeling that even a small, small bump of heroin gave me. 

over time i did it more often, but the same amounts. i think it gradually got worse and worse over the span of like 8 months. i was relatively good at keeping myself from becoming a full on addict. for one, my dealer knew i was the one using at this point, and he felt really bad about me. he wasn't a real heroin dealer, he was a user who was selling me some. and eventually, he cut me off. 

for a bit i struggled. i wasn't able to get h and i was so desperate for it that it made me depressed, and i think my anguish in relation to my addiction became more obvious to those around me. my parents chopped it up to me being depressed or anxious, my friends basically thought the same. i did something incredibly risky to find a dealer, i went through someone at our school and said my friend was looking for a dealer. its possible that the person i contacted could have told everyone and my whole secret would have been blown wide open, but they didn't. 

and so i found this new dealer, and he was sketchier than micah, but had better stuff. i went back to snorting after my month or so long break where i had no access. i paid for it just mostly through my job. it didn't take long for my tolerance to go back. i entered my senior year of high school as a dope addict, but found it easy to maintain my image as the cool popular girl. nobody, and i really mean nobody except my dealer, knew. 

eventually, i knew i was heading to college at the end of the year. i knew i couldn't go on like this at all. sometime after my 18th birthday, i went sober. part of it? for my 18th birthday, while all my friends wanted to party and my parents wanted to take me out to a nice dinner, i faked being sick so i could stay in my room and do h all day. it was all i wanted. that was kind of a wake up call for me to get sober before this got worse. and i went back on it a week later, and then 5 days after that i went sober again. during this time, i basically was just in my room or in the park most of my days. i skipped a ton of school. my parents had no idea what was wrong with me. 

eventually, after trial and error, i actually managed to be sober for a while. like 5 months. then i took 2 of my moms pain meds and got high from that, and was very close to going back to my dealer but decided against it. 

i went to college sober, and there was not even the opportunity to get heroin at the college. my urges went down, and eventually i just stopped thinking about it as much. i never tried any opiates, ever, after that. 

i also never told anyone about my addiction to heroin. ever. not even my current husband. never my parents. 

its just so weird to think about honestly. i was so, so not the stereotype of what a heroin addict was, and yet i was one. ",11
"i just gave a suburban mom the middle finger and it felt so empowering. light i'm a 16 year old boy i live in the suburbs. tonight we have a big parade in the downtown of our city, so tons of cars are driving there and back. i dropped off my parents so they could drink, and had to take the neighborhood route back home since all the main streets were packed. i went 20 on the neighborhood roads since there were people and parked cars everywhere. i noticed a white minivan was riding my ass and i was a little annoyed but not angry yet. then we got to the stoplight, and they tried to cross the double yellow lines just to be ahead of me in the left turn lane, but i sped ahead because i was not having that shit. so we were both waiting to go left and i had the longest yellow arrow of my life. also everyone was going where we came from so there was not a single gap i could have went left on. but mrs. everythinghastobeperfectformebecausemyhusbandisrich honked 3 times and kept raising her hand and acting like i'm an idiot for not risking my fucking life to make a left turn. 

so as soon as i got that green arrow, i drove right next to her and mouthed a glorious ""fuck you bitch"", complete with a middle finger. the look on her face was priceless. she looked so offended and shocked that i would use vulgar language in her little christian suburb.

i usually try to be civil and not get on the bad side of people with more authority than me, but damn that was l i b e r a t i n g. i'm so sick of rich ass moms doing whatever they want without any consequences, so to upset her like that just felt great.",11

"i steal my housemate's food and nobody ever suspects me because they think i am vegan. i was vegan when we started living together but i gave up since then and i started stealing anything i can get my hands on. they never suspect me because they think i wouldn't eat those items. 
never been even close to being caught.  
i always make sure to cook when nobody is home or to hide packaging and wrappers in my trash. 
it's more about the fact that i can do it without consequences that makes me do it. nobody complained about missing food items more that a couple of times so i dont think i am that much of a nuisance.







edit: just wanted to clarify a few things. 
i dont lie about being vegan. other people in my life know i am not a vegan anymore and i dont lie or hide this fact from anyone. the people i live with are never really around to socialise so they never had the chance to find out about it. 
also if they ever said something about being upset or really in a bad situation because of my actions i would definetly stop. my reasoning is that i dont take a lot or that what i take was going to go to waste anyway( food constantly goes bad in the fridge).
this is no way me trying to get away from the fact that what i'm doing is wrong.  i know i souldnt be doing it but it's a bit of an addiction.",11

i feel so bad. i know that bad parenting played a role in this, too. you never know how much that shit impacts you until you're older. my mom taught us that our looks were our only worth. but my sister ended up proving her massively wrong by pursuing a master's degree and being driven to be a smart, high-functioning human. she's making very good money in sf now. and to top it off, she is very beautiful. she was never ugly.",11
"i've never been to my math class sober. i passed my last year of highschool with 11 points in math (i live in germany, we have grades from 1 to 15, 15 being the best). i could never stand math, it bored the ever loving fuck out of me. so for my last year i decided i'm not gonna bother anymore. i got drunk before every lesson because that's what made them at least interesting enough to deal with. i talk a lot when i'm drunk, normally i'm very shy and don't really say stuff in lessons espially when it's a subject i'm not good at. so i got good grades just for that - talking. i'm the kind of drunk that seems pretty sober to a certain point. i never crossed that line. no one noticed i turned up drunk to every math lesson that year.

that being said, this wasn't a good thing. don't do this just because it turned out ok for me.  also don't drink out of boredom just because i did. i'm putting this on a cofession side because this is not something to be proud of!

edit: a lof people are commenting that people must have noticed. i know for a fact that no one noticed because i had some really good friends in that class. when they found out about this, they told me i'm crazy and that i should stop immediately. these friends knew me very well. if they couldn't even tell i was drunk, no one else would. i also used very strong cologne around that time so, no, you couldn't smell it. when they told me to stop this (they cared a lot about me, still do, if they had known earlier they definitely would have told me to stop) i had already stopped. i just did this for my math class. i'm not an alcohol (anymore). i only drink on special occasions. i never drink to 'get through' stuff anymore. i'm fine now. please stop commenting that i should get help. don't worry about me.",11

my parents refuse to get better internet using bullshit excuses like ""its too expensive""""you will be on it all the time"" and my favourite ""our neighbours complained about the guy that installed the new cables."" it's bullshit because we are on an old plan and its cheaper to switch i am pretty active and  there is no proof bad installation guy exists.

"i ""accidentally"" found out my employer was closing his business so i waited out on purpose to get a redundancy.. long story. bear with me.

i worked 10 years in my previous job as an e-commerce and store manager. i loved my job. i loved my staff. i loved the clients. 

i did not love my boss. he was the most unprofessional and mean person i ever met. he was rude and ignorant to everybody and always thought he was right no matter what evidence anybody had to support the other.

i have posted enough about him in previous threads. but i hated him. after years of his emotional bullying and gaslighting i was broken down. i went into a depression utterly lost and feeling worthless. i started applying for better jobs. so did my staff. they were open with me. we knew he was the problem.

one day one of my staff called me out of the blue. did i know anything about a redundancy? i hadn't a clue what they were talking about. you see, we had a 'shop' ipod attached to our speaker system. however it was synced with my employers personal iphone. any calls, any whatsapp's and any texts went through his ipod aswell. a mild inconvenience to us if we were using spotify but whatever. 

a text notification popped up that was from my employers accountant. the message read ""i'm not to sure in regards to statutory redundancy..."" with the rest of the text cut off that my staff saw as they were changing the music on the ipod. my employer had folded a concession in a department store the year previous, perhaps he was following up with that? i really hadn't a clue but this seemed plausible. it would be typical of him to leave important redundancy issues this late as he was an asshat. my staff were appeased, panic over. nothing to do with us. right?

except now i was curious. i knew i couldn't look into previous texts on the ipod unless the messages had already been read by my employer. i waited until i was cashing up alone one evening a few days later and went to the ipod.

there was a thread of messages from my employer to his accountant about putting the business into liquidation. i was shocked. i felt sick reading somebody else's messages but i could not know.

was he talking about the previous location? there was no other details attached other than looking into redundancy and claiming liquidation. it didn't specify any staff or store location or time periods. i didn't share this information with my staff.

but then i started looking into my employers behaviour. he was skittish, stopped showing up to work and was acting more odd than usual.

i held out. i turned down a job and cut out a holiday i had planned to take. sure enough, 3 weeks later i got an email about a staff meeting in regards to ""financial readjustment"" of the company. i knew the final bell had tolled.

i still want my oscar for my incredible performance of hearing this ""news"" for the first time.

i got my redundancy. 4 months late. a healthy sum and a welcome one because i'm saving for a house.

of course he fought me on the amount and tried to short me almost €2000 but when i told his accountant i was going to bring him to the claims court  all of a sudden my calculations were correct!

so yeah. that's my little confession. and i'm not sorry. fuck you *employers name*, you're a prick  and what goes around comes around.

edit; for all us readers. severance is the same idea as redundancy. redundancy is an instance where your job is no longer available or the business closes. you get paid either by your employer or through a subsidised government redundancy scheme. the later has a few qualifying factors.",11
"i let my son believe he's a dinosaur because it helps him sleep better. my 2.5 year old thinks he's a dinosaur. like...24/7 acts like a dino. it started at about a year old when i made him a dinosaur hoodie for halloween. he started pretending a lot and ""roaring"" at everyone. then in transitioning from crib to bed he picked out dinosaur sheets and it's all dinosaurs all the time from then on. 

he roars constantly and at total strangers. he has a whole dinosaur ""family"" of toys that follows him everywhere. he walks like a dino and tell me every morning what new species he is and gets really upset when i forget today's type. at first i thought it was cute. then after a week i got concerned. now after a couple months i've fully embraced it. 

with an active two year old, it's sometimes hard to get him to calm down and go to bed. but since the dinosaur ""awakening"" he's gone to bed flawlessly so long as i pretend he is a ""longneck"" traveling to the great valley (land before time reference for those that done know). i spin this big story and he closes his eyes and gets so excited. it's his favorite thing in the world. my favorite thing in the world is hearing a quiet, whispered ""rawr"" in response to my ""goodnight, i love you."" 

he'll probably be upset one day when he discovers i've used his overactive imagination to trick him into sleeping, eating broccoli, walking faster on our hikes, etc. on the other hand, i have two months worth of super cute videos of him ""speaking"" dinosaur, so i think i'm okay with it. :)  🦖 🦕 ",11
"i always bullshit my way through school (and most recently college). i've always hated reading long texts when i'm not interested on the topic. so, when i was in high school and the teachers gave an assignment related to reading (like in english class, when we had to read macbeth, of mice and men, etc). i would just read chapter summaries and do the respective essays and tests (my lowest grade was like a b). and so on. or this other time when we were watching a documentary for social studies class and the teacher told us that we had to write the key ideas in a piece of paper. i remember that it was boring, so i was just on my phone and every once in a while i would write some ideas that i heard. i didn't write more than ten, and when my teacher read it he said ""this is one of the best summaries i've read"". then, someone told me that this would not work in college when you really had to study. nope, still works. i'm taking a communication class where we have to read a long and boring textbook and write a one page summary in our own words. for this, i just google the title of every chapter and get some ideas from different websites and write my summary. so far, i've earned a's in these summaries, and another a in the first exam. sometimes i regret it because i know i'm not really learning anything, but i believe studying shouldn't be the only thing you care for in life, so i'm not going to stress out about the classes i don't like (and that are not required for my degree) and i'm going to continue doing this for as long as i can.

"i got drunk at work , stole cheesecake and ended up passed out in the dressing room. so this happened a few years back.  i worked for a high end clothing store as a stock clerk/order pull.  one week they asked me if i would be willing to work the night shift from 8pm to 4am.  these were very unusual hours and it was me and two other coworkers required to stay.  i had another job lined up at the time so my commitment for the current one was not very strong to begin with.

i decided i wanted to make my night a little more interesting so before i work i stopped and bought a bottle of whiskey knowing that my boss would not be working and it would be very relaxed.  i ended up drinking a lot more than i should have.  i'm great at handling my alcohol and my friends will tell me that i dont seem even slightly drunk, when on the inside i know exactly how drunk i am.  so i pounded a bottle of whiskey in my car right before going in.  about an hour and a half into my shift, i was stumbling and knocking stuff over, luckily none of my coworkers saw this.   i started getting hungry and i knew that on the 3rd floor there was a little bakery/restaurant that the store owns.  i'm not sure why they dont lock the bakery up but i thought it would be a good idea to go check it out.  i ended up hoping over the counter and getting into all of their cheesecakes.  i had about 4 slices of 4 different types of cheesecake, and i also helped myself to some sprite.  i was so happy but i started to feel really tired after, i ended up going into one of the dressing rooms and completely passed out on one of the benches inside.  i woke up about 2.5 hours later with my name blaring over the loud speaker.  i thought for sure someone had seen me and reported me.  i got to one of my coworkers and they were saying ""where were you?!? where did you go, we've been looking all over for you!!""  i told them i got sick and i was puking in the bathroom and needed to go home.  no more questions were asked and i was sent home that night.  never ended up getting caught.",11

several years before he died, there was a night where my wife and i were lying in bed.  i honestly have no idea what i ate that day, but i had a case of particularly noxious gas.  i happened let a silent one go right as bubba jumped up on the foot of the bed.  he walked up to the head of the bed, every step he took helped push the fumes out towards the top of the covers.  he reached the pillows and decided to curl up right between my wife and i, with his butt conveniently pointed towards her.  it was then that the fumes got out and my wife instinctively blamed bubba.  she grabbed him off the bed, ejected him from the room, and closed the door.  as she spent the next couple minutes complaining about the cat, i couldn't say anything.  it was all i could do to keep from laughing about the cat getting the blame.

2 years ago bubba died of a heart attack.  he was walking across the family room and fell over dead instantly.  i will always remember you, and i will never forget the time you took one for the team.

so when i was first there i met this man we'll call 'sev'. he was very bi-polar but was a loving dude at heart who was also battling addiction and depression. we would spend hours a day talking and i watched him progress from having nothing to almost owning his own apartment within a few months. i was so proud of the dude and was excited for his new life he created for himself. he had a new job, new clothes, a bike and a cell phone, little things he just didn't have while living on the street. seeing that kind of progress always gave me hope for myself.

so one day he came in limping, pale and just like he was on the brink of death. me and the other residents at the shelter asked him about it and he seemed to just blow us off, not admitting anything to anyone. the other guards said he relapsed and was just drunk. being an alcoholic myself i didn't buy it. it got progressively worse and worse as the days went on. 

one day he didn't come home during his curfew. everyone was looking for him, calling his phone, checking his regular hang-out places. nobody had seen him. i was working the night shift and a police officer came buy and dropped him off. he couldn't even hold himself up. the smell coming off his body was a mixture of just about every bodily fluid you can excrete. i had to carry him to his room or else he would he wouldn't have moved. apparently they found him in a ditch by a lake or something... 

the next few days were spent in his room with other homeless people doing what little they could to help. i knew this wasn't a drinking binge. i asked if i could call the ambulance and my bosses said there was nothing i was allowed to do if i wanted to keep my job.

i guess he drank antifreeze a few days before and it takes a week to fully die. he went in probably the most painful way you can go. it still haunts me. i know there was nothing i could do but still. dude deserved to live. nobody knows who he is. he just disappeared. but i remember.

"gave mince beef to a vegetarian. in year 8 food tech we had to make a unique pasta dish.
i decided to do bare minimum and make a vegetarian dish.
literally just spag bol with quorn. homemade sauce.
so we make the meals and cook them and then we have tasting. i put mine in the vegetarian section. 
everyone is trying it and enjoying it, one girl who is an actual vegetarian has seconds because 'it's delicious'

feeling dead proud of my self.
go home and tell my dad... awkward silence. he forgot to get quorn and just put minced beef in a pyrex dish for me.

tl;dr - gave a vegetarian minced beef thinking it was quorn and they loved it.

edit: in work so not been able to respond.
thought i'd clarify a few points

1. i was a dumb 12 year old who'd never cooked before also day dreamed quite a bit didn't pay attention to what was in the pan

2. genuinely unintentional, also didn't know this girl was a vegetarian until she mentioned it later

3. no idea if it was morales or other reasons to being a vegetarian.

ha also quite easy to see who are meat eaters on this thread.",11
"i regret coming out especially to my best friends..  i came out as bisexual to most people when i was 18. when i turned 19 i started dating a wonderful girl who i considered marrying. i was head over heels in love and she wanted me to tell my family. i was scared. they are conservative and my dad was even a pastor for a while. i loved her enough that i did. i told everyone in my life. i was blocked by most of my extended family and didn't talk to my mom while i was dating her. my dad was uncomfortable. he pretended he didn't care because his wife is okay with that but he totally did. 

awhile passed and i realized it was my first love and i wanted to figure myself out before settling down. i dated around for a few years and didn't favor either gender. i dated a couple girls and a couple guys. currently i'm with  a wonderful man who i adore. we have been together 5 years and are getting married in october. 

everyone thinks i went through a phase. my mom always tells me that she's glad i snapped out of it. a lot of my friends, some in the lgbt community, make jokes about my 'gay phase.' they knew i would end up with a man all along because bisexuality isn't real.  others are angry i'm with a man because i'm suffocating my lesbian self. 

some ask if i'll ever get a girlfriend after marriage  because it's not cheating, right?? one of my best friends gets drunk and tries to kiss me when she's drunk because she's bi too! plus our partners would love to watch it! 

it makes me so angry and i wish i had never told anyone.  keeping it hidden would be better than this fake support and people believing my sexuality was a phase. ",11
"i fed my boyfriend and his friends dog food. no regrets

i was in high school, it was the late 80s. i was emancipated already, so i had my own apartment. i also had pay channels because the landlord had a package deal that included my tv. 

a guy started really hitting on me, whom i really rather liked. it didn't dawn on me that he had only started doing so *after* i got my own apartment (which meant time away from his restrictive home environment for him). 

well, he started spending time at my house, then he started bringing his friends to watch my pay channels with him and ignoring me... the first time they ate my food, i had cooked myself some crockpot chili for the entire week. it was literally all my meals for the week, to be divvied up into the freezer and eaten as needed. i asked nicely for them not to do it again and explained clearly that it was all my food for the week.

they did it again the next weekend when i made myself a lasagna.... and this time i yelled at them. my erstwhile 'boyfriend' then slapped me and told me to knock it off (i was interrupting their show, you know). i was rather outraged that not one guy, not *one* so much as batted an eye about it.

instead of breaking up with him immediately, though, i hatched a plot... i bought two cans of alpo wet dog food and a bag of egg noodles. i made ""goulash"" with it in the crockpot and let them eat it. 

after that, i brought the landlord's dog up. i carefully let him lick each and every bowl (because, of course, they didn't wash their dishes after they stole my food, either). i placed them into the cabinet as nonchalantly as i could, pretending this was how i always did dishes.

i then answered their question about ""what was the recipe"" of my ""delicious"" food.... and placed the two open cans of alpo on the table.

needless to say, they never came back. i took great relish in spreading it around school that they not only ate literal dog food--but they loved it enough to want the recipe.

edit: tl;dr my ""boyfriend"" and his buddies ate my food twice. when i objected, he slapped me. so i fed them dog food.",11
"i once pickpocketed a friend of a friend and consoled her afterwards because she was sad her wallet was stolen. first of all: i know i was a complete asshole and wouldn't even consider it now.

we were at a sort of carnival party where everybody dresses up etc. my girlfriend at the time was with a group of friends she didn't know too well and didn't like either. i was in a group of wrong friends and did wrong things to impress them, like stealing/pickpocketing.

at the party i was on a roll and decided to make it a little more exciting (cringe when i think about it now) so i decided to pickpocket the 'friend' of my girlfriend. it worked out and my 'friends' were proud of me which i would have done a lot for in that period.. the haul wasn't even that great but that wasn't even the motivation for me at the time. 

later when we went home we waited on the train and the 'friend' of my girlfriend was crying because she lost her wallet. which i stole. her friends were all feeling bad for her, except my girlfriend, and i decided with my dickheadish head to try and console her. it worked for as far as i remember, at least she stopped crying. my girlfriend knew about it and she only laughed about it, eventually we broke up which was one of the last strings between me and my 'evil' friends.

i was a dick and learned from it, but for me it was still the most dumb/mean thing i ever did even tho i got away with it..",11
"i vengefully ejaculated on my ex-girlfriend's art project. i'm always very reserved; the opposite of an impulsive person. this was an exception.

some backstory: this all happened a few years back, in college. she was my only serious relationship, which lasted about a year. wicked smart woman in most ways, but emotionally? total idiot. we had that in common. she was going abroad for a semester and decided that she wanted us to split up  (so that she could focus on her studies) with the intention to get back together after she returned to the states. we were both pretty torn up by the decision but admitted it was probably for the best. i tried to support her by keeping my distance, but confusingly, she reversed her that stance very quickly and started leaning on me (as an ex in a different country) for all her emotional support. it was pretty rough. i did what i could but obviously it wasn't enough. then, i hit the low point for my own loneliness and reached out. she immediately flipped the switch and acted uncomfortable that now i was the vulnerable one. she texted me at the end of summer that she no longer wanted to get back together, but tepidly left the door open to change her mind.

when the new semester started, my ex continued to give off mixed messages. right away she wanted to be best friends, but i really wasn't in the right head space for that. as you might imagine, i still had some hangups about how i was treated and didn't want to jump into a deep platonic friendship without some sort of reconciliation. about two months later, she invited me to a dinner party. thinking this would be a good avenue to make amends,  i bit the bullet and attended. it was immediately awkward. we barely even made eye contact at the party...but she was very chatty with some other boy i'd never seen before. turns out that in addition to her bitter ex-boyfriend, she also invited the guy she was currently sleeping with to the same party. whoops. this already felt like a slap in the face for me, but just as the party was winding down, she couldn't even wait until i'd left the room before grabbing the other boy's hand and walking up to her bedroom with him.

it sounds hackneyed, but i never truly understood what people meant by ""heartbreak"" until this moment. the entire center of my body felt like it had run out of batteries and just shut down, sitting like a lump of cold metal in my rib-cage. once i had stumbled home, i swigged some suspiciously cheap vodka and contemplated carving my ex's initials into my arm with a pocket knife. i was badly out of sorts. in rare act of spontaneous judgement, i began gathering up all the little mementos and gifts she'd given me since we had first met. some of this shit was the most thoughtful, clever things you could hope for from a significant other, but i couldn't bare to look at them anymore. without digression, i tossed everything related to her in a garbage bag. i admitted all of this to her months later, in a rambling, mopey email. she was understandably distraught that i would do this. what i didn't tell her (or anyone, for obvious reasons) was this next part.

right next to my bed, i had taped up a painting she'd made in a class. it was a white-on-black, minimalist rendering of a nude woman. i was never aroused by it or anything...it was just a cute little art print that my ex had created and decided to gift me. i put it on my wall because it was hers, not because of what it looked like. but for whatever reason, whether because of the subject matter or the fact that it was hand-crafted by her, this print was the one and only object i would not let enter the trash unscathed. i tore it off the wall, then angrily jerked off into it (thinking of my ex the whole time, of course). it was the most wrathful masturbation i've experienced to this day. once i had finished, i looked down at what i had wrought. i was mostly disgusted. why did i even do this? but...something about the contrast of a white puddle on a black canvas, obscuring the image of the nameless woman painted there...well, it was oddly aesthetic, in a childish way. and fitting. this wasn't my intention, but in that moment, i felt like a bit of an artist. no way in hell this nasty thing was going back on the wall, though. i crumpled it up, tossed it in the bag, and walked an extra block to a faraway dumpster where no one would recognize me.

the whole thing was gross, stupid, immature, aimless, and did next to nothing in my goal of getting over the relationship. years later, i'm still single, and i still miss her. all the same, no artist could have created a better visual representation for my complicated feelings at the time. i may have defiled a piece of innocent art like a sad creep, but for a brief instant, i grieved as a heartbroken painter.

"i caused my school to hold an assembly on locking stall doors in the bathroom.. one time in elementary school i would go to the bathrooms and lock the stall doors then crawl under the doors and leave them locked and then i'd get water from the sinks and cup it in my hand then splash water under the doors so they'd then leave. this meant that anyone who wanted to use a stall had to crawl under the door and get all wet, and they couldnt tell if it was pee or just water. i did this for 7 weeks before the entire school held an assembly about it.

i still have no regrets.",11

"i almost died of alcohol poisoning and then lied about it. i almost died of alcohol poisoning last weekend. i was in a party with some friends. in barely 2 hours i drank a whole bottle of gin by myself. besides the alcohol i also consumed 2gr of weed and some ecstasy (unsure about the quantity.)

i wasn't feeling bad or unwell but suddenly i started feeling weird. not bad. just weird. i decided to leave the party just in case i got worse. i didn't tell anyone, i just left. 

while i was waiting for the bus to come i started to feel really bad. i couldn't even stand on my feet and everything seemed to spin around me. then i passed out.

things get a little dark up from this point because i really don't remember much. i remember looking up to the sky. throwing up. a crowd of people looking down on me. an ambulance coming. me being carried to the hospital. more throwing up. 

here is where the lies begin. as i was being taken to the hospital i realised what was happening. i knew that they would call my parents if i told them i am underage so i hid my id in my shoe. (i am 17, in my country the legal age of adulthood is 18.) luckily i look older. when asked about it, i gave them a fake name, fake adress, fake details about myself...when asked if there was someone they could call i told them that all my friends were as drunk as i was (which was probably true), 
that i was living alone and that no one could pick me up. i told them i had no money for a taxi and that i had to walk home.

the medics injected me with some adrenaline, vitamines and other drugs and just let me go. no question asked. 

when my friends asked about what happened to me, i told them i was just fucking with some girl i met. 

i actually feel horrible about what i did and i needed to talk about it, even if it's just on some random internet page.

edit: 

there's lots of people in the comments saying how mixing drugs is the most stupid thing one can do. i know that. when i took all that shit i thought it wouldn't be so bad. i regret it now. i should have been more careful.

some people have asked why i drink so much. the truth is, i've had depression. i am much better now, some people even say i'm 'cured' but still, i drink because it helps me forget about myself. for a night, it's like i'm a different person and all the problems and bad things in my life dissapear. still, i never drink more than a quarter or even half a bottle. drinking the entire bottle is new to me. i'm still trying to figure out how i lost control of myself. i never lose control. 

anyway, before this i thought i wanted to die but i never wanted to live as much as i wanted to live when i was lying on a hospital bed struggling to keep breathing. i'm looking forward to talk about this experience with my therapist. 

finally, thanks to everyone for worrying about me and for supporting me and for giving me advice about how to handle this situation and about how  to improve myself. i really mean this, thank you very much for your love and support.",11
"iv'e been pretending to be a college student for the past two years.. at 23 years old, i decided that i wanted to live the college experience because i had never had the opportunity to see what college was like. so i ""enrolled"" at the local university which has around 30,000 students and pretended to be a student there.  i joined various clubs, went to classes, and i even got involved with a fraternity for a short stint. i simply told everybody that i was a sophomore and that i took the majority of my classes online.  nobody ever questioned me either, i assume that people think i'm around 20 or 21.  


i took advantage of the various clubs that the school had to offer. i joined a film production club, an improv club, joined a rec sports team, got involved with a church and ran the sound board for them for a short stint, and i even got involved with a fraternity for a couple of months.   this was all without even going to school there, but i figured it was a great way to get involved and meet people around my age relatively (even though the majority of them are 3-5 years younger)  i also met many people, made some friends, and even got invited to parties.

i'll be 25 in the next couple of months and i'm starting to realize i probably won't be able to do this forever.  there will come a day when i start to look noticeably older than everybody else.  so i figure i may have another year or two before it's clear that i definitely look older than 21.",11
"at the age of 7, i tied up my neighbor of my age to a chair until she said she loved me. i was basically a piece of shit younger. and this just hit me today like a mf train. i feel so bad.

what happened is that i was with my neighbor home, both 7, and we used to kiss each other whenever we were in private. 

one time, she told me she loved somebody in her class. what i did was tie her to a chair, and told her that she couldn't get out after she said she loved me. this lasted for like 25 minutes at most, and after that i released her.

"i put fish tank water in her coffee maker. when i was in college, i had the worst roommate ever. no respect for privacy, noise, or my food in the fridge. what had really tipped the iceberg for me was the day she started yelling at me for the way our room smelled. told me i needed to be showering at least once a day. i wasn't the problem; it was her stupid microwave meals that made our place smell like shit.  

i didn't have enough balls back then to tell her to fuck off, so what did i do? the next time i had to clean out the water for my betta fish's tank, i dumped the semi-gross water into her fancy keurig coffee maker. she made coffee in that thing for the next week until i moved out. i have no regrets. and, if by some miracle, she's reading this: fuck you rikki!

tldr; college roommate pissed me off so i put dirty fish tank water in her coffee maker

edited to add: another reason my roommate pissed me off was because i had been gifted a can of pepper spray by one of my friends and ex roomie thought it would be a good idea to test it in our tiny 15''x12' dorm room

"i'm a 15 yo (male) drug addict. a little background. i live in a tri-city area where 3 of 3 city's have a drug problem and only 2 of 3 show up on the news for it (i live in the ""safer"" city).

 i think the main reason i'm addicted is curiosity and depression. the drugs i've tried are (in order of trying them); weed, alcohol, lsd, adderall, dxm, dph. if i'm not mistaken that means i've tried every type besides opiates and benzos (i'm stupid but not that stupid).

 i'm mainly addicted to dxm and dph bc of there easy access. every time i go to my grandparents house i go to their medicine cabinet and see what i can take. it's gotten to the point that it's all i think about.

 and the worst part is, i'm taking everybody down with me, for example one day i went over to my best friend of nearly 4 years to smoke weed and pick up some adderall he was about to move so we decided to get fucked up (he took 30mg and i took 45) it was great besides him having a small panic attack which ended quite quickly. however about a week (after he moved) later he texted me that he was in the hospital bc he took 90mg xr and didn't eat for 3 days turns out he got hella addicted, which is my fault.

 my other best friend of nearly 3 years doesn't do any drugs, and when i told her of my problem(s) i feel like a burden on her life and bc i'm another thing she has to worry about. when i told her about my problem i told her i was trying to sober up and i was. but my dad turned off my service (for other reasons) and i couldn't talk to her, or anyone. ended up relapsing within a week of ""becoming sober"". that was over two months ago and i still haven't talked to her. since then it got way worse, i started ordering dxm to my house and my dad caught me when i ordered over 10 grams of dxm, and gave me a super long talk about the ""addiction demon"" (which i have) but i didn't tell him bc i was to nervous. 

since it's summer break and i've had no service to text my normal guy i haven't had access to weed or lsd, but as soon as school starts back i will and i'm a little scared of how bad it gonna get

"i flooded a hotel washroom with my shit.. i was staying at this hotel during a family vacation and i ate a bad chicken wrap. my family went to go for a walk so i dipped and hauled ass to the bathroom in the lobby. the second i went in, i knew there was no holding back. i just released it all, thinking i was alone. it sounded like an elephant blowing its nose and echoed throughout the room. a voice next to me went, ""goddamn"" and another one laughed. it was humiliating. then, after my business, i went to flush the toilet, and that's when the mess (pun intended) all started. after i pressed the button, the water rose but kept rising. i painfully watched it creep to the top hoping it would stop, but it just kept going. i watched as a mixture of my shit and toilet water spilled over the edges, pouring onto the floor. the water kept going and pretty soon the people beside me were going, ""what the hell is that??!"" and were frantically panicking. at this point i knew that it would start flooding the room, so i had to make a dash for it. i ran out the stall. my cheeks burned as i dashed outside the lobby area, but not before seeing the ""out of order"" sign taped to the washroom stall door. to this day, no one knew it was me.

"my fiance & i tested his sister's supposed gluten allergy.. edit: she's been to the doctor for both celiac & gluten allergy/sensitivity tests. her results came back negative for both, but she says the doc is lying in order to run more tests.

edit 2: holy shit is my inbox blowing up!

edit 3: this was 2 years ago. his mother found out and gave us a severe tongue lashing, then told the sister and she screamed at us for an hour. we've not done it since, and will never do it again.

---------------

we were both so sick and tired of listening to his sister whine about gluten this, and gluten that. and she'll carry on about how everything had to be gluten-free to the point where she's taken over the family pantry.

mind, we both understand the seriousness of celiac disease. so the only reason we decided to test her was because is how she eats when it something she really wants.

one night she found out halfway through dinner that her dad forgotten about the gf breadcrumbs she'd bought, and had instead used the normal variety he's been cooking with as far back as he can remember. holy hell did she raise a stink! completely stopped eating her meal and sent the rest of the night bitching & moaning about stomach cramps and other assorted bathroom issues. this carried on into the next day where she lectured him about gluten allergies while still morning about bathroom problems.

now, when it's something she really wants, is a completely different story. she'll eat whatever it is and go about her day like a normal human being. not a peep about stomach pains or anything, sometimes she'll even have seconds or behind it to work for lunch the next day.

so here's where we expirimented with her. the recipe called for browning the hamburger then mixing in some flour to make a paste. i was going to skip it entirely to be nice, but my fiance said he wanted to test her response. so i made the recipe as listed but only he & i knew about it. everyone ate the dinner, rave reviews! they told me i could make that again any time! and wouldn't you know, not one peep from the sister. she even had it for lunch the next couple days and still not a word!",11
"my brother talked me into stealing $300 worth of game cards for him.. when i was 10 years old my big brother (14 at the time) was super into world of warcraft. he knew that i would do what he asked me to, so he came into my room and asked me if i could steal some game cards to satisfy his gaming life (game cards are small credit card sized plastic ""coupons"" you buy in order to play the game. they let you play for a month). he even said that if i do this for him, we could go into the toy store and steal some lego for me.

stupid me asked how many i had to steal ,,meh, just crab 10 and shove em in your backpack"". what i didn't know was that they were worth 200dkk a peice ($30). and what i didn't know either was that they were equipped with alarm ""chips"". so i walked out of the shop with my backpack full of gamecards worth 2000dkk ($300). the alarm goes off and i start running. i've never been so scared in my life. they must have thought it was a false alarm as they didn't seem to chase me.

in the time after this i threw up on a daily to weekly basis. my parents thought i was sick and took me to the doctor and they tried all kinds of things. i continued to stick my fingers in my throat and throw up in order to feel better even a year after it happened. i never really got over it. i'm 21 today and i have never told anyone.

"kid crying over a lego set he wasn't allowed to buy, so i bought it in front of him, for myself.. boys like lego, right?

sort of sounds weird that lots of the current kids who are in to star wars, are only in to it because of the lego sets of it they saw when they were younger.

i wasn't any different.

when i was four or five, i got one of those small $2 packs of some star wars character that's usually on the side of the checkout lanes with all the candy and gum. i didn't know what it was then, but there were blasters and i wanted it. i wasn't a spoiled child, i never asked for much. so my parents didn't really care, it was only $2.

i didn't know what i was getting in to.

by the time i was six, i had watched all the star wars films and cared too much about the clone wars show. ten years later, i'm still a star wars nerd and i'm currently surrounded by four giant posters and a bunch of memorabilia. 

let's go back again. when i was 8, i bought my second lego set. i actually knew what star wars was this time, so i wasn't going to get a set of some random unnamed jedi that died during order 66 fighting against one clone trooper. 

i just got some regular $10 one. not the mini packets, but not the giant cardboard sets either. 
i wasn't a very needy child, it was the second lego set i ever bought, the first one from two years earlier still in perfect condition to this day.

but there was this kid. this damn kid...

i knew what i wanted to get, but i noticed there was only one on the shelf. now i'm a nice person, i don't stand too close to strangers, i give him his space. so i decided, alright i'll just walk in and get it after the kid moves away.

that kid literally didn't move away.

his hands all over my box and the one i wanted. he started crying all over the place. smearing his hands all wet with tears on the box. he held it in his hand and ran all over the store with it. his face was bright red, damn, he wanted that thing. after his guardian said no for the millionth time, he put it back on the shelf.

it was time. run in quickly, grab it, pay for it, and walk out. so i ran in, grabbed it, paid for it, and walked out. but this isn't one of those small mall locations. this store was huge. the checkout counter was at the very back, so i had to walk for like a minute to get to the front.

since i was at the store with my family friend, i just sat there while he picked out some lego set meant for kids, like the bigger blocks kinda thing. 

star wars episode vi: return of the kid.

the kid comes back to the same location, dragging his mom. it's probably the first time the mom even walked there with him, she just kept saying no before.

the kid was so confused. the box which was there minutes ago, was suddenly gone. his mom thought that there was nothing there in the first place, she picked him up, and carried him out the store. the kid, still bawling his eyes out.

as the mom had him over her shoulder, the kid glanced at me as he was being carried out. he saw the set he wanted in my hand. keep in mind that this set is small, so i told the cashier no when he asked me if i wanted a bag. i mean i'll just put it in the bag of another store my parents are shopping in, no need for more plastic bags.

the kid sees it. he starts screaming and pointing and trying to get his mom's attention. the kid barely makes out the words telling his mom that i took what he wanted. now, she understands that i took what her son wanted. she comes up to me, with her kid staring down at me as i'm sitting on the ledge by the front of the store.

""thank you.""

edit: ""thank you"" as in an actual sincere thank you. not a sarcastic ""thanks a lot"" type.

edit #2: i didn't buy it to spite him. i wanted the set originally, the kid was just there.

edit #3: here it is(https://brickset.com/sets/theme-star-wars/year-2008) (the first one, the ""imperial dropship"")

edit #4: i'm not an adult doing this out of spite. i'm currently 16, i did this 8 years ago. the kid was maybe 5 or 6.

i mean i guess i felt bad about it. i was in his position two years earlier, really wanting something that i really wanted. guess time just changes like that.

and that's the story of how i displayed my superiority over a crying child, without t-posing. ",11
"i had to steal my family's vhs after a porn movie got stuck in it.. when i was 14 i found my dad's stash of porn magazines and vhs movies. i played one of the movies (fuck my wife ii), after watching, i couldn't get the cassette out, it was stuck, i tried everything, including a knife and a hammer in a panicked state since my parents were coming home from work soon. i ended up stuffing it in my backpack, going out of the house with it and dumping it in a field near my house. my parents must have noticed the porn movie gone with the vhs player because they never asked about it (it was the only one we had and they bought another one right after)",11
