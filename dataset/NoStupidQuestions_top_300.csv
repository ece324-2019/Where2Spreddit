"does anyone else stay up at night because they feel if they go to sleep then they havent gotten enough free time at home? i'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes i feel that if i go to sleep early then i'll just be like ""well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home."" sometimes i just stay up so i actually feel more at home and not always have that feeling of just school, school, school. does anyone else feel this way, maybe with work as well?  

edit: i know people don't like it when others edit their message saying ""thank you"" or anything, but dang did i not expect this post to be the highest post in the sub after i, ironically, came home from school. thank you all!  

it is interesting to see a lot more people than i thought stay up for free time as well. i can't imagine going to school or going to work, then going to sleep only a couple or few hours later, only to do the same thing again the next day.",7

"how do you repair relations with crows? story is relevant.

my neighbourhood has a lot of crows. over twenty of them. they are generally on good terms with one another.

i watched them band together and kill one of the crows. they left its dead body in my yard. i waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because i don't want crow guts everywhere.

however, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. this brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. none of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time i am outside. some swoop. they are becoming more and more aggressive.

confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do i repair relations with these crows? i don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

google is not helpful on this front at all. there is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.


is it as simple as feeding them every day? something else? am i doomed?",7

"my brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt? my brother died in a work accident. his drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.

anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

he was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn't able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

i wanted to know if it was instant? would it hurt? did he burn alive? 

i told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online i don't know if that's true. 

i'm crying right now, it just sucks and i miss him terribly. 

edit: for those asking, this accident happened last may. the emotions are raw and fresh again because easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

i had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

with it coming up again, i just keep thinking why did i cancel? we could have had one last day with him but we didn't. i want to go up this year, in his memory but i don't know if i can.

"matched with girl on tinder. profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10. i blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. she randomly calls me and i was like shit she sounds super young. i text her and ask if she's 18. she said yes. later she texts me and said she was lying. she facetimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

this is dangerous. what can i do to notify her parents ?  it is an att number. should i call them?

she used fake pictures of course. i could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. i will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. i reported it to tinder and that's all i will do. some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. the second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) i hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. she revealed she was 10 while i was in the process of blocking the number.

then people made fun of me when they knew i'm a virgin. even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

i made a post in a tech subreddit. not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

i know it might not be a big deal. but i felt so down after that. i felt like i should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world...

"just became homeless and have $130 and a bike, what do i do? so a few hours ago i was kicked out of my parents house. i've been ""disowned"" or something. they made it really clear they wont be taking me back. im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

i was able to get my bike from my parents' since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. i was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. im guessing i'll have to buy something every few hours so i won't get kicked out. 

so basically what the fuck do i do next? im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. so if there's an app or a website for that i'll take recommendations.




edit: im saved!! well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. he works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. this post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

edit2: wow this blew up fast. i see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. i never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. i wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. i'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. as long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

a lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. i worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

a lot of people were recommending joining the military. i've considered the navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. my situation isnt that bad. and again, thanks to everyone for all the advice",7
"i (27f) haven't had any friends for 10 years. are others here like me? after going so long without regular socialization, were you able to make friends? how? 

i feel like i wear normal clothes, if not super fashionable. i'm groomed and wear some makeup. ive been called a good person, etc by many different people. i want to think it's not me, but i'm the only common factor.

i have a very small family and they don't talk to me much either, generally don't seem to want anything to do with me. 

i guess it would just be cool to know i'm not the only one who has been so alone for so long.

edit: i usually think these edits are annoying, but i really want to thank all of the support and everyone for sharing their experiences. turns out feeling lonely/not having friends for a really long time is pretty common. if anyone wants to chat or find a friend, there's tons of people looking for friends here and so am i :d",7

"was i sexually assaulted? if so, what should i do? for the past couple of months, i've been working in a restaurant. there's this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she's looking through my social media profiles, won't stop snapping me or facebooking me, i've since deleted her snapchat and blocked her on facebook. 

anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. i moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which i responded ""not by you"". so she went to kick me in the balls but i moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

as we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. she moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which i pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. she said ""i'm only joking"" before trying to do it again in fucking plain sight of the others. i told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. all the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. the manager wasn't present during this.

anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" i responded ""is it?"" he said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

honestly, i don't know what to think. i am contemplating telling the manager but i feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because i'm a man. and no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. just think of it, if i had done that, i'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

the whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that steven crowder guy from the meme). you see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

i'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

but i never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. hell i can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

"a pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room. so really quick background on this, i live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. so there are this two pigeons (a couple i assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. i thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. so some days later, i found a twig in my bed. and then is when i realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. so i then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

so things were kinda okay but then after coming home, i found that i forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. and also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause i was too lazy to sort them out. i scared the pigeon away, but then i found an egg in my bed. it fucking laid an egg. why are these birds so dumbasses? man, also i live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. i didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as i thought.  so i put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  but the bird is not coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. i placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? so what am i gonna do? will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

so is there any problem that if i touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

&#x200b;

edit; these things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, i found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

***edit*** \#4: idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. so when i found the bird and the egg on my bed, i think it was gonna lay another egg but i scattered it away. and quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah i thought they laid two at the same time)
* and as u/kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so i'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? man these birbs",7

so basically how did the playboy mansion work? so a bunch of hot girls were selected to live with hugh hefner for a selected amount of time and get paid for it? 

i saw a post in the ""askwomen"" sub and they were all about how hugh hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. this confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. iirc these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. so why do some people hate hugh so badly? like what exactly did he do? and also how did the playboy mansion work?

you are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. and we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

the only other reason i've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

i will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, i will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

but for real i am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

edit 2: thanks for all the responses, guys. wasn't expecting this to be popular at all. reading through most of the comments (and sorry i don't have time to reply to everyone!), i think my best temporary option is to try filtering the smell from the vent i think it's coming from as best as i can. if that doesn't work, i may try the ""positive air flow"" technique recommended by the thermodynamics stoner. a more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when i move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
reading through my lease agreement, i actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
lastly, i'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. i don't care if anyone else smokes weed. i was born and raised in austin. i can probably count on one hand how many people i knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. i just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

"can you wish me a happy birthday? very few of my friends wished me a happy birthday this morning (in australia), and i want to feel loved, and if complete strangers are the only other people that might help, so be it. i turned 15 today. thanks!

post-question edit: i seriously can't believe how many of you came to wish me a happy birthday! i gotta say, i reckon the best present of my day was discovering the true kindness of strangers, and i can't thank all 2618 or so of you enough for it!

extra thanks have to go out for the wonderful people that went out of their way to get me something for my birthday, which was certainly the last thing i was expecting. from the influx of birthday videos that are in my youtube history, to the steam game codes, to the ms paint-drawn picture of me holding a cake, to the 3 months of reddit gold, to the masses of invaluable advice and wisdom, to the many people that extended their friendships to me if and when i might need them, even to the reddit admin that brought his wishes! 

you all are amazing, and thanks once again!

"why don't we use slides (like on the playground) as a serious means of vertical transportation in buildings? they're more convenient than stairs, cheaper than elevators and escalators, and faster than all three. and on top of that, they're fun. they're only one way and not wheelchair accessible, but then again so are escalators. (and stairs aren't wheelchair-accessible either.) would there be any downside to replacing downward escalators with slides everywhere?",7

"why doesn't netflix have a ""not interested"" button for its recommendations? so many websites that work on recommendation algorithms have some way to flag ""hey i'm not interested in this, please don't show it to me"".

it clears up clutter, and it also gives the algorithm useful information that it can use for future recommendations. 

youtube has it, facebook, instagram, snapchat... is there a specific reason netflix hasn't implemented this?",7

"if my cat hates being stepped on, why does he keep laying in the hallway where he keeps getting stepped on? if a rat get electrocuted every time it does ____ it'll eventually stop doing _____. not our cat.

is he an idiot? or is this normal for cats? you'd think after the 10th time he's yowled from being kicked/stepped on, he'd move his ass but nope.

(and for the record no, we're not stepping on him on purpose. he lays in the middle of a narrow, high-traffic hallway where it's really dark and he's mostly black.)

**edit:** wow thank you for all the responses. i learned a lot about cats today.

to everyone asking why i don't get a nightlight for the hall, i live in a shitty apartment with no outlets in this hallway. it's always very dark. someone did suggest a tap light which might work, thanks!

"deaf/mute people of reddit: do you sign during sex? during sex, my girlfriend and i are often very vocal: dirty talk, ""i love you""s, saying each other's names, etc. for us it adds to the intimacy and sexual experience a lot.

so deaf/mute folks out there: do you ever use sign language during sex? if so, is it just to give consent or to ask your partner to do something? or is it something thing that adds to the intimacy for you? or are your hands usually just too busy the whole time to bother signing?",7

i end up retaining way more of what they said from looking out into space but i feel like i always appear rude because i wasn't making eye contact. i would always respond with making eye contact, but it's so difficult for me to actively listen to someone staring them straight in the eye. does this happen to anyone else?",7
