"a message to our users. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today in askscience we wish to spotlight our solidarity with the subreddits that have closed today, whose operations depend critically on timely communication and input from the admins.  this post is motivated by the events of today coupled with previous interactions askscience moderators have had in the past with the reddit staff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is an issue that has been chronically inadequate for moderators of large subreddits reaching out to the admins over the years. reddit is a great site with an even more amazing community, however it is frustrating to volunteer time to run a large subreddit and have questions go unacknowledged by the people running the site.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have not gone private because our team has chosen to keep the subreddit open for our readers, but instead stating our disapproval of how events have been handled currently as well as the past.",10

one statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and i'm glad it is taking place.

another point brought up was education and degrees. in this question, i don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

i realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. one just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. it also begs the question: what is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

an educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. however, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**. depending on the definition of ""educational divide"" and high-quality data available, such divide might potentially be underway.",10

"gravitational wave megathread. hi everyone! we are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 est / 15:30 utc) from the ligo(http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. this thread will be edited as updates become available. we'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!

faq:

> where do they come from?

the source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. ligo observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> how fast do they go?

gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_of_gravity)).

> haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

the 1993 nobel prize in physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, psr b1913+16(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psr_b1913%2b16).

in 2014, the bicep2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicep_and_keck_array#bicep2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. a joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the planck and bicep2 team in january 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the milky way.

> does this mean we can control gravity?

no. more precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. it takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. for more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see here(http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> what's the practical application?

here(http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> how is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? is this gravitons?

here(https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (see limits on gravitons below!)

2. there is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. a nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety. it is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus ""absorbing"" the radiation and dying immediately after birth.

**update**: thanks for all the great comments, everyone. this kinda blew up so i figured i'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments i found particularly enlightening. obviously i'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. this can just function as a tldr.

first of all, i'm gonna limit what i put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like egyptian, mayan, greek and latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken english and ipa usage. really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* latin, greek and mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the rosetta stone. when greeks invaded egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. many egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (this i found super interesting) names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this greek language infusion. this means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* in the example of tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (tut, ankh, and amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. the appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: as an example, ""tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""tawat 'ankhu qaman"" (taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn).

* finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. this part seems kind of confusing and i might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. see u/ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

"askscience ama series: we are scientists here to discuss our breakthrough results from the event horizon telescope. aua!. we have captured the first image of a black hole. ask us anything!

the event horizon telescope (eht) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, eht researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

the image reveals the black hole at the centre of messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby virgo galaxy cluster. this black hole resides 55 million light-years from earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the sun

- press conference right now! eso.org/live(https://www.eso.org/live/).
- details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/eht
- press release: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1907/

we are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result. we will be available starting with 20:00 cest (14:00 edt, 18:00 utc). ask us anything!

"how are we able to perform a body transplant when we can't repair spinal injuries?. so as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted ""head transplant"" is scheduled to occur later this year. i haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. however to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?

edit: so this blew up quite a bit. for the record, i am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, i simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.

i am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what i'm asking about.

there surely still are (and at least there *have been*) small tribes where clothing is not worn at all. is sexuality in these groups affected by these standards? a relation could be made between western nudist communities.

are there (native or non-western) cultures that commonly fetishize body parts other than the western standard of vagina, penis, butt and breasts? if so, is clothing in any way related to this phenomenom?

**most importantly:**

if i was to do research on this topic myself, is there even any terminology for ""sexuality of a culture relating to clothes""?

"could a modern day human survive and thrive in earth 65 million years ago?. for the sake of argument assume that you travelled back 65 million years.  
now, could a modern day human survive in earth's environment that existed 65 million years ago?  would the air be breathable?  how about temperature?  water drinkable?  how about food?  plants/meat edible?
i presume diseases would be an non issue since most of us have evolved our immune system based off past infections.  however, how about parasites?

"could an ipod ever successfully shuffle an album in the correct order? what are the odds of this?. edit: thanks everyone for the awesome answers. 

if i wasn't clear, i was wondering more about selecting an album, hitting shuffle songs, and having it shuffle in the correct order. it seems the general responses have been more tailored to selecting a playlist and having the album play in the correct order.

it appears the math is similar regardless, but is the algorithm affected differently?
