"update: my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married. first of all thank you so much for all the replies, i didnt think this would get so big. i have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that i write like a man, whatever that means xd)

also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

&#x200b;

i went and talked to him this morning i told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. he was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. i was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. i told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so i ended it and left him. i am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. thanks everyone :)",8
"update my 32m best friend 30 f asked if i would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, i am in love with her but sje has no idea. i appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. there was a few idiots telling me i needed to be alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

however i am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",8
"mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad. update 3:

hey guys, and update has already been posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). please don't message me so angrily any more.

update 2:

sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. regardless, i think i will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

my sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and i have her support.

i promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now i need to support my grandma.

thank you again to everyone.

\-

update:

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but i chickened out half way through what i had to say :(

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

\-

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

\-

edit: comments are coming in faster than i can reply, but i am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things i didn't even think about before. thank you everyone.

i will try to answer as much as i can, but there's more comments than i can handle.",8
"happy update: it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

hi all. first off, i want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or pm. i am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support i received and i spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as i read your messages and well wishes.

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

\my name\""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

we're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

edit: i'm going to bed. thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",8
"update i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i talked to her. i would like to preface this post with an apology. i know it has been nearly three weeks since i last posted. to be honest, in no world did i ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. i've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original it, i have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. for that, i am sorry.

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",8
"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents). hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived. 

i'm just so incredibly happy that i get to keep both relationships.",8
"update : wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"" it has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

^((original post)(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",8
"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom. throwaway, because reasons.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"me 52m just found out at least 4 of my 5 children 33f30f28m24f14f are not mine. wife 51f wont say anything. ***note: please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. if you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local medlab (medical lab). ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. in my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while i'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how i should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. it is incredibly upsetting and i am already going through a lot. i feel i need to clarify since everyone seems to care that i had food after i found out. i had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which i had been all over the place. i had lunch at 11am and nothing else until i left. i was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. please stop harassing me about that.",8
"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

my grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

my mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",8
"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",8
"update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant. orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**tl;dr:** wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july. wife got pregnant anyways. it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.

update **tl;dr** at bottom

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"yesterday, my(33m) wife's (34f) best friend (female) contacted me and told me that her husband and my wife were having an affair and my 3yo daughter is actually his daughter. wife and i have been together since high school. married for 10 years. i'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

my wife's best friend megan and i work for the same company( different departments ). so yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. so i met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. i tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

and when i confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when i told her that megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

i really don't know what to do. i mean, everything was a lie right? my little girl taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. what do i live for now? i just don't know what to do. just here for some advice. i'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",8
"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything? original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

edit: jesus christ this exploded fast. thanks for all the kind words people 😅",8
"happy update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**tl;dr  use your words. - wife and i objectively went through everything.  we both apologized, getting a nipp soon and hopefully a therapist.**

update: the paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )",8

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

also, if you're going to message and insult me via pm, just be warned: i've killed ^a ^baby before.",8
"update i (28m) is about to propose to my gf (28f) of 7 years, but then i discovered something. need advice. hello guys. im providing an update to my earlier post

i dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. so here's what happened. 

-she texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 pm (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-i tried to facetime her 11:51 pm just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. i tried messaging her but no response. 

remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? i browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 pm.

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

then i laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

she finally admitted. 

i am single.

"can't wait until thursday....my(48m) wife(44f) is going to be shocked **\*\*\*update\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"update: my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place nsfw link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",8
"update: my (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. what can i do to make her enjoy her last days? original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (21m) wouldn't pay for my meal when i forgot my wallet basically the title. 

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

how messed up is that? like why is he so cheap. a random stranger paid for me and he wouldn't",8
"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: i didn't expect this to go to the front page, but my wife has seen the post. i have been unable to face her and there is no way to get out of going to the zoo with the other family today.  i appreciate all the serious feedback and i will update tonight.",8
"i think i got reverse catfished last night i matched with this girl on tinder. she was significantly bigger than girls i normally date. but we have literally everything thing in common so i figured i'd give it a shot. so after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

edit: i didn't expect this to be downvoted so much. i guess people just prefer the standard ""i just walked in on my fiance and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis' inside her at the same time. should i still go through with the wedding?""",8

&#x200b;

super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",8
"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",8
"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail? throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",8
"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

i finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. a lot of things that i never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"my (19f) boyfriend (20m) broke up with me because i'm too good at sex we've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. we took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. and after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

even after our first time, he asked me if i really was a virgin or if i lied because i was too good. no i didn't lie. i just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. since then, he'd get weird during sex. like if i did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. now i know he was questioning if i really was a virgin. 

anyway. he broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. tmi i was riding him and he said i act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy i've been with and he thinks i lied to him. i told him i watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

great. never thought i'd be dumped for being too good at sex. it just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. i want him back. i know he's just being paranoid. how do i tell him that i wasn't lying?

okay quick update: he texted me and said sorry so we're back together :)",8
"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."" 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",8
"update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke with her after she decided to keep the baby. original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

thanks reddit.",8
"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next? ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.


edit:  i'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from reddit. thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. really, really.
i promise i will post an update!

"my(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. i need help dealing with my wife and my daughter. i'm actually an immigrant from mexico, so my english is average at best. 

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",8
"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish... op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well 


**tl;dr told her, broke up with her.**",8
"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him? ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",8
"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her? two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8

short update because i'm supposed to be working. and i don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but i don't know who else to tell. 

the day after i posted originally, i told her i'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". it went well. really well, so easily and just good. and she slept next to me again that night.. i got to kiss her in public! she said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

i am going to take everyone's advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but i want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. because everything just makes sense now. 

and yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

"caught my girlfriend cheating and i cannot cope please help so long story short i found texts on my(18m) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like ""he pounded my shit"" ""i got some of the best dick last night"" and ""omg it was so good, i couldn't walk last night""

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

please help




edit:  wow.  i don't even know what to say.  guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  i get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

i finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  i woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  thank you so much.  reddit is such a beautiful place.  in the strangest way, i feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  you guys definitely played a part in that.

this is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  keep up being great in life guys :)

thank you from the bottom of my heart!


edit2:  jesus guys!  you're all a blessing!  i just finished class and i've been getting notifications every three seconds!  going to do my best to get back to everyone.

i am doing much, much better.  i'm feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  thank you all.

by far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  i'm going to dinner rn but i'm hitting the iron directly after!

on top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, i've had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching sat prep was praised for ""outstanding qualifications""

-  i got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that i've been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

i'm doing well, thank you all, you're all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you're all worth a platinum in my eyes!

cheers!

i did it guys :)

"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

edit: i don't need any pm's full of criticism, don't bother. just comment somewhere if you want to spit some nonsense",8
"wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"" this is all over the place. i really need help.

my wife and i (m42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

all this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. after some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

we were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. ofcourse i was super happy . 

a week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. the test came back negative and ofcourse i was devastated but she wasn't. she claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. we took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. my wife is in complete denial. now she claims we are having twins. she is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

i am at a loss and don't know what to do. my inaction is making her believe that i want to leave them and that i am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

what the f is even happening. i love her but i don't know what to do.

edit : forgott to add. i have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

**little update/edit:** thank you guys you really helped me out. yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. i've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. i would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully i will be able to update good news someday. but a fuck you to those that said i should divorce her because she is ""crazy"" and an extra fuck you to the guy that used this post to push his anti abortion agenda.",8
"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

i feel shit. was i wrong?",8
"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8
"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

i dont know when i feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, i am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

thanks!

edit 1: thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate the support alot. i however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

i would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. i am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

i also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). in a month? when i am back from vacation?

once again thanks for all the support

edit 2: my friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that i have to pick it up by myself. i dont know why she is still acting like this. i am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind.",8
"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8
"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",8
"girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 kennedy half dollars to buy drugs my girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. he lives with us (we are both late 20's and have ft jobs).

i have been stacking 1964 kennedy half dollars for ten years now. for those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

i had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

i insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like i mentioned. whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. and according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? what then?

she also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". i collect them partially for a store of value incase of inflation or deflation, but i also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

i guess i'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. it also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",8
"update: i 24f am dating a 25m almost unreasonably picky eater and i'm pretty much at the end of my rope previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this happened last night.

&#x200b;

this update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than i had hoped but it is what it is. i read what you all wrote and i appreciate all the comments left for me. despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that i'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

i decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. he needed help and so long as i saw that he was trying that was all i asked for. we were out to dinner (i'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" i was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but i figured now was as good a time as any: 

me: maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. maybe you can just try new german cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

j: no way. i have people depending on me to continue this streak. i don't want to let them down.

me: i don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, i'm worried about you. this is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. you're about to go on this incredible trip to germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. i think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

we had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. he doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how i was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. i let him know how this is my business because it affects me. we can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

we let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. the plan after was to go back to his place where i would spend the night. the entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while i wished i had just gone home. i should have gone home. i guess i didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when i got to his place.

he flipped.

he began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how i couldn't control what he did or ate. i told him i cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. i ultimately agreed that he was right, i couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that i stick around and watch and enable him like i had been doing in the past. 

it escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when i was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. i could not and still cannot dispute that. he was. i guess the only difference between him and i is that i wanted to change. i acknowledged the issue and knew i could not go on like this any longer. obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. one spirals much faster than the other so i was able to recognize it much quicker. 

i told him i was going to leave because i couldn't deal with this anymore. we kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. he has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. he would be sharing it on facebook. i completely panicked. i cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. he told me if i walked out he absolutely would. 

that was all i needed to hear. he was going to blackmail me. i think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. if i leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

so i left. i don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all i care. he emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

let him post it. fuck it. i can't control other people i can only control myself and how i react. i deactivated all my social media and i'm ready to move on with my life. it hurts that somebody i trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. thank you all for reading.

"my(23f) boyfriend(25f) left me on the side of the road and i deserved it. my amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. he was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. after we were done we left, and we were about half way home when i asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. he said something like ""haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. my stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""c'mon, please? i want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. after that i kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than i deserve, he's firm and says no. i give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. apparently i pulled harder than i thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. to make things worse, he just bought this car. the driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). they didn't even exchange any information. while he's being yelled at, i don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something i did. when he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. his entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. to try and break the tension a little, i say ""well, that could've gone a lot worse."" as soon as i say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. i've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment i did. he looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. i got out and he sped off. it was starting to get dark and i was in a stretch of woods. it took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when i got there him and all his stuff was gone.

i feel so horrible. i cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. we've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now i don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. i've been getting texts like ""wtf"" and ""what the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so i think he's told them what happened. 

it seems like everybody's mad at me. is there any way to fix this? how can i apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",8
"i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had it was quite by accident that i heard this.  we had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  some of us were in one room playing texas holdem and a couple of others were watching a lord of the ring marathon.  i thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  our group had run out of soda so i got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  as i'm rounding the corner i hear my fiance talking and before i completely come in the room i hear her clearly say ""jason is great but he will never be the lover that bill was"" she then followed it up with ""its not really fair to jason though, bill was just really gifted down there"".

at first i thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but i decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and i could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know i was there.  of course she has no idea i heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how i'm doing and if i'm having fun.  i was tempted to say something like ""i'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but i didn't.  i just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  i just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

needless to say it fucked me up.  i mean fucked me up bad.  i've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  i couldn't sleep that night and i went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  at first i was angry.  then i was humiliated.  then i was depressed.  then i was angry again.

look i realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  i would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

i tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on i just kept getting worse and worse.  i was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  that is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and i flat out rejected her.  it wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  i had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  but in the moment instead of being sexually aroused i felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

she asked me what was wrong and i just told her i must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

so much to my humiliation there i laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  i came clean and told her what i heard.

well this did not go over well at all.  at first she tried to tell me i did not hear her correctly.  but i just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  which once again i am sure was more of a big turn off for her because i was a wreck emotionally.

she tried to tell me how much of a better person i was and how i satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  but all i could hear was charlie browns teacher noise.

it's been almost a month and i have zero desire to be with her sexually.  none.  she is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what i have tried i just can not get past this.  it's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  she clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  well i know i can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  but no matter what i do i can't grow in size.  obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me i won't believe her.  she's most likely right.

some back story here.  he dumped her.  it was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  i know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  she said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  so this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  if he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  now i have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but i don't think she would.

i just don't know what to do here.  i can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  i know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that i think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told i am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  like what would happen if i lost my good paying job or better yet what if i were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  basically what i feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  i know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what i feel.

i'm sorry for the length here and i don't even know what i am asking here.  i am totally lost and if this continues i just think i am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and i need advice.

&#x200b;

edit:  holy god.  i made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  i have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  i don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  i am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  also thank you for the gold and silver kind internet strangers.

edit 2:  dear god.  i read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking i had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5k more posts.  i'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   i was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  i haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have i opened any of the 20 chat screens.  there are issues i want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  she was to use the barney gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  in other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  nope, neither of us drink.  we don't even have it in the house.
2. that i am upset she told her friend.  well this is an odd thing, before i posted this honestly i wasn't that upset about this part.  i was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  however now reading a lot of the post i have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  i would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. that i am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  well i'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  but the last part is just out of my control.  no matter what i do i will only ever be 7"" long.  we have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  she said that i was already great with everything but the one thing i can't control. (okay, so i gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. no i'm not going to do anything rash.  it's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  but yes i have to decide what i am going to do here before long.  it's not fair to either of us is i am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. she is sorry that i heard it.  she said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if i didn't catch her saying it.  it is what it is.  but yes i do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since i first told her.  me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  i don't know how much of that i believe but right now i guess i don't know why she would lie.  it really has wrecked hell on our christmas spirit this year i know that. 

edit 3:  engineer for those who keep asking what i do for a living.  she is a paralegal.  
edit 4:  people have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how i know she was heartbroken.  we met about 9 months after they separated.  i know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  he just ended things so he could be with another woman.  she approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  on our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  it was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but i did it.  we sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time i never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates i tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because i didn't want to commit either.  after close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  obviously that was our first night together.  within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  so yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  i had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

edit 5:  okay i posted it below in the mass of other posts but i have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",8
"engagement ring/breakup fund update thank you all!! i appreciate the traction this silly post gained. your responses have more that assured me that i've got something here. i got back from my parent's 25th anniversary party my sisters and i put on today and the post blew up. i hope to some day be half as close with someone as my parents! 

i did my best to get through all the comments and reply/upvote where appropriate. have an amazing day everyone!
****

whenever i start a new relationship i start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. i'm a big romantic so i intend on using this money, in the event this girl is ""the one"", towards an engagement ring far down the road. subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, i cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. is this idea brilliant or am i putting too much attention on these extremes?",8
"update i've been putting off introducing my 28m girlfriend 26f to my parents 60sm/f because they'll be weird about her weight op(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

went like this. paraphrasing of course. 


me: hey mom and dad, you know i mentioned a girlfriend a few times. we're moving in together so i'm thinking i'll bring her out. 


mom: oh that's nice. first week of december maybe? 


me: sure. look there's one thing though. she's not thin. if you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. i love her. and she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so i expect you to show her the same respect. 


mom: but you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


me: no. this is exactly what i'm talking about. 


mom: fine. i'm just happy i finally get to meet her. 


dad: *insulting weight related comment*


me: what the fuck dad? 


mom: oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


me: no if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, i'll just not come. i have zero tolerance for this. you're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


dad: *insulting joke* 



me: ok, bye. if you wonder why brother is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



mom: no, wait, i'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


dad: *insulting comment* 



me: i'm hanging up. 


so it looks like i'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. probably not soon. my girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and i started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""it would be nice if i could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

so thanks for the comments and help. for now it's a non issue it turns out. 


*tl;dr: my dad couldn't even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we're just going to let this go for now.*",8
"i m 32 ruined christmas and i have no regrets. is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years i was the one who blew up for the first time. 

long story short, i'm half-korean/half-white. my mom is korean. my dad side is white. so we only have my dad's side here in the us. for years, i watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. they never invite her to things. me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. to be frank, i don't care how i'm treated. every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. we repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. my mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. my white grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

three times today i watched a family member (aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should i sit?"". i watched my mom quietly recoil and i couldn't stand to see it again. this aunt does it the most and i finally blew up. i yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. i told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. to stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the us for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. i watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

my aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. as she was leaving i walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. i said  ""for 30 years i watched my mom give you a gift every year. i watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. i've never seen you treat her with the same"".  she didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

before i left, i apologized to everyone and explained why i was upset. everyone was shocked how mad i got. i felt like everyone understood why i was mad.  prior to this (around thanksgiving) i spoke to some family members about how i was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. which they have been trying to do more. 

after blowing up, it made things awkward. people trickled out early too. now my grandma is talking about not doing christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. i feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. does anyone have any advice on this? handling rude family?  should i do something else? 


edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below

mom's reaction: on the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. she's always taken the high road it's a very korean christian mom approach. my mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older immigrant/korean/boomer approach too. it's taught me a valuable skill in life. i don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being korean/white. after we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. she didn't say anything and asked me if i wanted my favorite korean dish. 

where is my dad: he was in the other room. yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. he's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. we'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. we would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. my dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. as soon as i got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (i can't describe it). there wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. i was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. my white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. for years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

me: reflecting on this as a whole. i can't believe the response. it shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. after thanksgiving i started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. i have no relationship with this aunt. i should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. a small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. if she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""f*ck her"".  please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. i should have tried to speak and i did what i felt was right, i don't regret it.. grandma's 80th bday is in two months.  i can't wait for that to be awkward. someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. cheers and have a happy new years!

update 12/29/18
i wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how i felt and i didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. i explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. i told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. i told her i wished i had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. i told her i want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. i'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

i called my grandma to let her know i sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. i told her i didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. my grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. i was right for standing up for my mom. also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""i never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
tldr: after 32 years i finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something i've been feeling for years. how do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. should i do something for blowing up?

"update: my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help. edit:  here is the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200b;

its been awhile since my original post, but i didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

since then, not much has improved. i decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. to my surprise, she agreed and i was so happy.

unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  i had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

this was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.  i feel so broken right now.  i'm going to see a counselor in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

i dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but i pray that she takes advantage of it because i still love her and i did this because i still do.

i told myself i would stop enabling her, mainly because i just cannot sustain this life. i am physically and mentally exhausted.  my kids are my top priority but i cant take care of them if i dont first take care of myself.

i thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. she was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and i hope that it will help her.

thanks for reading.",8

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

ok so i first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200b;

so after a week of avoiding i came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. she was happy to see me and i told her to sit down because we need to talk.

i started things with saying that i know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. her face turned red and she started crying like hell. she knew what i was talking about. i told her the story about the dna test, about jennet and basically what i told you guys in the last post.

well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. she told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. he didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

she told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. when the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. after a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. as they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. she tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when i started crying. she started crying too. the couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. we were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. it took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(they came to their senses after a day or so). she reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. she made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

a few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. after so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. he met me a few times and i knew him as one of rose's old friends from the park. he helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. ironically i'm glad i got to know him before he passed, even if i didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200b;

btw, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

so after hearing this i told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and i told her i understand she did the right thing. i pulled out an ""it's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and i headed off to my parents(adoptive) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200b;

i'm glad she is my mother. i feel for the first time in years - complete. i don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and i honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. thanks reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",8
"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews.

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",8
"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"this morning i (27m) found out my gf (27f) cheated on me, where to go from here? so our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but i asked my boss if i could come in late as i had some stuff i had to do. however i went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. she gave me a key to her apartment and when i went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




as soon as i walked in she saw me and burst into tears. the guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. i freaked out at first and the guy left. she kept asking what are you doing here, i thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. i tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



i took the flowers and the gift and left. i'm sitting at work right now because if i went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





we've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. i was looking up rings. she said it's because i was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. she thought i wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. i asked if there were any others but she said no. idk what to believe at this point. 




the kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. we had lunch and got a hotel room together. we had dinner at my place with my folks and i dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. i trusted her for fucks sake.




 how and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? what am i supposed to do from here?



tl;dr spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30pm. : i broke up with her, i told her i'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. i'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

"serious my (35m) girlfriend (24f) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and i'm not into it at all. so, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. an additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. i've never thought much of it, i thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. but she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that i'm not entirely comfortable with. a few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first i was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. i laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. i said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said i'd do it the following day. honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. i told her no, and i didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. am i being a dick here? i don't know what to do. sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion",8
"me (m34) and fiancee (f27), i am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship. alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as i'm doing it. as it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. i'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (i only found  out because one of her friend's bf contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). i confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. i'll be totally honest in saying that i'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. i manned up, moved on and proposed (which i had planned on doing anyway). this is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200b;

fast forward to recent time. we are due married in november (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. distant, not herself, away with the fairies. even stopped having sex, which was very strange. i put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. forward to christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. i confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. i was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200b;

however, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. i arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. the vibe was bad guys, i could tell. we sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. at this rate i was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. basically, a few of her friends had back in october (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. i'll be honest, the idea made me ill. i said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........i got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. i wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. we got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. i basically said that i needed some headspace, and that i'd spend the weekend at my mates. it was quick after that, and i left without a fuss. i'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. i am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. i suppose if anyone has been in a similar place i could do with some advice 

&#x200b;

tldr; me (34m) and fiancee (27f), she asked for open relationship and i am fuming. ",8
"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",8
"i(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when i was told to look after the family pet. my siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and i've been of to uni. 

i am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. i've been trying to act like i didn't care but when they were driving to the airport i couldn't stop crying. my mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. last time we went to a family vacation was when i was around 13. i cried so much i had cramps in my abdomen.

i wrote them a message trying to make them understand what i was feeling and that it hurt me alot. i got back that i was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. they said they thought i wanted to be ""free"". i know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions i've tried to hide come through. i've never felt this left out and i feel like i'm not a family member. i'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on holliday.
i feel heartbroken.

my plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to uni and dive into school to forget.

how can i forgive them? has this happened to anyone else?

edit: 



i would have paid for myself. this is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. they brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. they are all there. the whole family. they brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. i would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",8

"update: i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom. &#x200b;

link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

i've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. i've also read through a lot of the comments. thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. there's been a lot of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. it's whatever at this point.

we had been texting off and on all evening. as promised, i agreed not to bring it up in person. when i got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. i was a little nervous not knowing what i might be walking into, but overall i just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. when i walked in it was clear so did she. her sister was helping her pack up her things. i didn't know what to say, but i never expected this. i honestly thought everything was going to be okay when i got home. her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

i walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. she didn't say anything either. she didn't even look at me. if she was going to leave i at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. everything i had read in the comments about buying a bidet and ocd lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than i had considered. i started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""you put this online? i told you to not talk about it!"" her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. she then accused me of cheating. what? this whole thing has been crazy and i feel like i had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. i snapped.

i told her sister i had never cheated. not once. i would never cheat on her. enough was enough, so i told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier i had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. everything went silent. like, no one said a word. out of nowhere they both start crying. her sister stared yelling at me and told me i shouldn't be talking about things i don't understand. when i asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that i need to mind my own business.

1. her sister knows about it. (she did not know i posted on reddit about it)
2. her sister thinks it's normal.
3. i need to mind my own business? they're my socks!

i stood there all kinds of messed up so i just left. i went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. i also called off work today. i went home and all her stuff is gone. i didn't text her back. i think i'm done.

to clarify a few things: she insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. she told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. she reaffirmed it's not a fetish. she won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. i can't keep up with the comments. i'm pooped. (i'm trying to find humor in this because i'm really upset :(

so yeah.

"my gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where i proposed. i decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. i flew her to vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in cambodia. she had wanted to see angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. after a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together i proposed and she said yes. we kissed and i had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. it's really beautiful. she took a shower and i laid in bed thinking what an amazing day i just had and how i would get to spend the rest of my life with the women i loved. when she came out of the shower however she was in tears. she handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

i played it cool and said i understood but truthfully it hurt. it seems to me that i had offered her something of value. a lifelong commitment and partner. i took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. i felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. it was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. if she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. so she can't possibly value me or what i have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place i asked. 

i'm preparing to end things when we get back. she wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but i'm done. am i wrong? should i do it over? what do you think.

any advice is appreciated.",8
"my (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if i don't be her surrogate she'll cut me out of her life forever. my mother and her new husband want to have a baby. she's still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. so her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she's older. she told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. she said all i have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. i told her i can't do that. for one, i'm trying to get my nursing degree and i don't want anything to slow me down. and i already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way i want to go through it again so soon. i'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. i don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. i gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". she told me all she wants is another baby and that i shouldn't deprive her of it when i can help her so easily. i tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then i don't want a relationship with you anymore"". i asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. i don't know what to do. my mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. i'm not sure how i should handle this. i think she's acting crazy.",8

i don't even know what to make of this. what should i do? it just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. i really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. am i just being sensitive? maybe i'm just emotional, but i feel like crying.",8
"my (36m) wife (33f) was sued, i'm feeling resentment towards her and i don't know how to move past it. fwiw this is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. no offense to reddit, but i'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but i'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

as the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. the money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

my currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger i'm feeling towards my wife. until now i've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. but, since i'm the breadwinner i can't help but to feel like i'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. i've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. however, i have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where i know my wife is guilty. she has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

what did my wife do? (note: i had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

she used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. my wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but laura gave her a personal email address instead. my wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as laura at her company. these messages said derogatory things about laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make laura look bad. her manager got one of these messages that claimed that laura was a heavy drug user. laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass laura. well, laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. not only that, but laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. my wife didn't know this at this point, but laura was pregnant. several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on laura behalf. 


using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. she did some more internet sleuthing and found laura's husband on facebook. laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. my wife sent him an email claiming that laura was cheating on him. the husband confronted laura about this email and laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  my wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. what she didn't realize was laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. she also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


my wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. one of laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. my wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) she did not make herself known immediately. instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. she was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about laura - my wife was telling people that laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. this was at an event where her husband was at as well. the word got back around to laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


i'm leaving a fair amount of information out - my wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in laura circle and sent them messages about laura on multiple occasions. all the messages were trying to paint laura in an extremely derogatory light. all the events i've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  my wife didn't think to mask her ip address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same ip address, ours. many of laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. they had ample evidence against her. all the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. she even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


i honestly felt awful for laura, there were lots of tears on her end. you could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. she said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. she was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. and that my wife's harassment continued even after laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


my wife has never done anything this crazy before. i knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. we've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. but, she really fucked up this time. i don't know how to move forward. i know someone is going to suggest therapy, but i really want to start building up an emergency fund again. we're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** wife was sued by her former best friend, i emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. i need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. what can we do to move forward?",8

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) found an engagement ring i was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. she thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't. i've been dating my girlfriend laura for just over two years. we met as i was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. we have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and i love her a great deal. she's definitely been the healthiest relationship i've ever had and i see a strong future with her. 

this weekend has been awful, however. my best friend rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend grace of about seven years. the problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. i offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. i hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last monday when he asked for it back. he (successfully!) proposed to grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

literally five minutes after she posted, laura rang me absolutely fuming. she told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had i given it to rob for grace when i'd clearly chosen it especially for her? was grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? i tried to talk her down and explain that i'd just been keeping it safe for rob and that i'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that i'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. she hung up on me, then texted me that i had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

am i wrong for thinking this is a red flag? i know that she probably was really excited and i absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. we don't live together and i don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. more than that, i am 100% not ready for marriage. we've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. i want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

what do i do? i totally understand why she'd be upset but i just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that i'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. this is the first big fight we've had and i'm not sure if i'm just seeing red flags because i'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

tl;dr: girlfriend snooped and found a ring that i was keeping safe for a friend. she's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by valentine's day or the relationship's off. need help determining what my next move should be.",8
"the way i (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. how do i tell people when they ask so i met my boyfriend a year ago. i posted on my cities subreddit that i was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

i got about 50 messages all together. one guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. i love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. i gave him my number and we texted all night. our first phone call was over an hour.

he told me he was also lonely. i mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. he offered to cuddle me. we decided to have a cuddle date

we met up the following week. he picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. we got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

that's how we met. i know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. people have asked how we met and i've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  i don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",8
"my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. nsfw update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

so, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, sarah 31f, my long-time partner, john 34m, and myself 29f.

i've known that sarah has had a crush on john for a long time. it's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, sarah has never crossed any boundaries. but because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(my boyfriend and i had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while i'm sleeping. she took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. she apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

i found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad i'm being abused.

but here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. he took the photos and videos *for me*. the day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so i can watch them because it's better than porn. 

but nobody believes me. they're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. i don't know what to do. i'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

how do i fix my friendships and convince everybody that **i'm** the one who wanted it? 

there is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but i do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. i'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

please help. i'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

edit: since this needs to be said, yes, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. it's a four digit code.

edit edit: 

- yes, i *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- i have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. just *mostly* everybody. i was upset and generalizing last night.

- i am in the us.

- my boyfriend **does have a passcode** on his phone. seriously. stop blaming him. this is *definitely* not his fault.

edit again since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and i: we attended a bbq where everybody left their phones inside. we *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

you guys are being a little mean about this.

**edit** (again): 

went to the police and will update when i can.

## minor update 

i went to the police last night, alone. after everything that was said, i was nervous about having john with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

really. y'all made me nervous.

i went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

at first, the officer at the window was like, ""i think that's a crime? maybe? i've gotta call my supervisor.""

that happened twice before the police were like, okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. we're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

i gave my report and left. about fifteen minutes later, i got a phone call from the local pd. they told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

my comments being that sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue john and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

they suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, i'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

so, that's about it. 

a bunch of hemming and hawing and i don't knows. they'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

i'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",8
"update: mym25 girlfriend24 of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommatem25. i just heard them through the wall. it's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. i don't know if this one will be allowed but i figured i'd give an update to my situation. 

original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> as the title says, we broke up. it was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. we broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so i can see why it happened.
> 
> this isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any pda while i'm around. i still both consider them friends and i just want them to be happy.
> 
> for the most part, they are quiet at night. if i really listen i can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. except for last night. we went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. i was the dd because i don't really drink. anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. i made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. i then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. as i was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. she thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when i was ready. when i finally got to bed i could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. then it got quiet and then it started.
> 
> i don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. i've been okay with the break up until now, i'm glad they're happy but last night i fell asleep crying.
> 
> i woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> feel free to ignore this, i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm sad when i really think about the situation, but that's why i try not to.
> 
> tl;dr: my ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

taking everyone's advice i announced that i was going to be moving out. my now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. i told him yes, but i'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. he decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. it's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. my landlord is xrms(ex-roommate) family friend, after xrm explained the situation i ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

xrm and xgf and a few other friends helped me move in. i had a house warming party and was specifically asked that i not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. xrm and xgf also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. my xgf stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. she said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. she told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. it was great. we've gone out a few times since our first date. 

the past few weeks have been the best in a long time, i never really realized how bad my situation was. obviously everything isn't perfect, and i still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but i'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

tl;dr: i moved out and started dating a new girl. ",8
"update: my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as i felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. a lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

i spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who i am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. she expressed some concern and agreed that i should speak with fiance's brother. fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. that sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because i went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because i didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. i got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because i was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. i just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. i knew that something really needed to change.

the next day fiance left for work and i left for school just as usual. i called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and i basically told him that i had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that i was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if i wanted to speak with him. i was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. i hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. i was extremely nervous and felt like i was doing something sneaky and horrible, but i needed to know what was going on. i spoke with his manager and learned that he had quit his job weeks ago!! he told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. wtf! so i guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. after work i went home and fiance was gaming. i told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. he finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. i was literally shaking at this point and told him that i was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. i said that i was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. i said that i was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. at this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. so i did something stupid and stood in front of the tv and said that i knew about him quitting his job to game all day. he flipped out. he got violent and pushed me away from the tv. there was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). i got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. he eventually came and apologized. he offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. i literally felt sick. i locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. he literally just kept gaming until i went to sleep.

the next day i couldn't go to school because i had a bad black eye, it was not something i could explain away. i wanted to just disappear. i got on the bus and went to the women's center. my cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad i looked. i was very adament that i don't want to press charges or anything, i just needed help with the next steps of getting away. the social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. she helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while i drafted and sent fiance a text stating that i cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. he called me nearly 20 times during the time i was at the center. i didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. for the short term i am staying with my cousin and her husband and i'm working on finding an apartment. next month i'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. i still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like i'm living in a nightmare. but for the past week or so i haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. i've also gone to bed before 11 every night. someone on here sent me a pm saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so i'm just glad i was able to get away when i did. 

i don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and i just wanted to put this out here.",8
"(update) my roommate's (21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21f) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

rm= roommate's mom   r=roommate

i came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and rm and r were in the kitchen making some coffee. she has never been there this early before. 

i decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. i atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (in brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points i listed:

1. i appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but i want to do that on my own. i love to cook and felt that i was never allowed in my own kitchen. i also told her that i want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. i don't want her in my room. i reminded her that i talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why i put the lock on the door.

3. i told her that if she wants to be with r, to let r text me and lmk that rm would be in the apartment. 

they expressed understanding and i hugged it out with rm. 

before going to class, i put a load of laundry. my friend is having a birthday dinner today, and i decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. i asked rm multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. i told her that i would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when i finish mine later this afternoon if needed (i didn't want her touching my clothes). she was okay with it and said r didn't have laundry today. cool. i left feeling really relieved, but i still locked my bedroom door. 

i got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and i couldn't find my white dress. as soon as i came home, r looked nervous. my clothes were in the dryer, and i didn't do that for a fact. rm states that i put them in the dryer and just forgot. ughhh. i locked myself in my room, and i know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

when i was in my room, i heard rm talking to r in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. in india, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" and she went on to tell r that i won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

i honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? i'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

i'm heading over to my parents right now and i'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. i'll keep you posted.

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m) throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

i think i'm going to confront them in the session this thursday.",8
"update my 42m daughter 14f won't get an abortion yesterday i posted https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because i didn't have ""throwra"". i've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

edit: thank you everyone so much for commenting. i expected maybe a dozen comments and i've got hundreds of pm's. thank you all so much for your help. i'm not sure what the rules of updating are, but if it's possible i'll update as soon as i can.",8
"wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant. i literally do not know what to do. this is long, **tl;dr** at bottom.

my wife and i have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  she's always been one of the most amazing people i've ever met. no huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. that's why this is so difficult for me.

we've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  she's in marketing and i work independently as an it consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  we decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  we've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

long story short, i was diagnosed with azoospermia last december.  blockage in the pipes just meant i wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. it's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this july.  she's got a high sex drive as do i, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way i could have gotten her pregnant.

she missed her period this week.  i couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  the babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  she took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

at first i was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. she's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. i'm not the jealous type, but i'm literally stuck.  the doctors said this couldn't happen.  and i can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

my wife's been ecstatic. she's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. she was so excited when she first found out that i didn't express my worries then.  but she left for work and now i feel completely torn.  what if she did cheat?

looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. she definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. she always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  i remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

fuck man i don't know what to do.  i set up an appointment on monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  if it is mine and i accuse her of cheating i feel like the world's biggest asshole. but she's coming home in a few hours and i don't know what i'm going to say to her, i can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and i just didn't see it.

do i wait until the doctor appointment monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? i'm worried i won't be able to hide what's going on.

**tl;dr:  wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july.  wife got pregnant anyways.  it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.  want to wait until monday, but don't think i can hide it.  what do i tell her?**

**edit:**  i should add i've been cheated on before.  our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  i'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**edit** i really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  my wife's coming home though in an hour and i have to decide if i'm going to put on a happy face until monday or not.

**edit** she texted saying she's going be home late

this is bringing up some old emotional scars i think and is just fucking with me.  i'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  i think i need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

"my 25m girlfriend29 suggested about having a ffm threesome. i was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. now she is giving me a hard time because i accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. am i being manipulated? hello all,
a few days ago my25m girlfriend29 suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

knowing her, i disagreed at first. she kept on insisting and i gave into the idea. i cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
a few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. then when i finally reached her she was crying. she seemed broken. she told me that i didn't deny her strong enough. she told me that had i ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. she was mad and we broke up because i didn't deny her strongly.
basically, i feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
i feel that i am being manipulated. dear reddit, please help me out. thanks.

update (2 weeks after the post): first off, thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. the comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. thanks a lot.

we had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. so, i decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. no clue about her intentions though, but i am at a much better place. thank you reddit!",8
"update: she20f lost her virginity while we were taking a break original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",8
"my 45m wife 42f revealed she was unfaithful and i'm divorcing her. our children 15f & 17m hate me for it. edit: guys, i appreciate the advice. but i'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. i've made my decision, and it's not something i'm willing to forgive. i'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

my wife and i have been together for 18 years. we had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. we've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

about two weeks ago i brought up an advice column in the paper i had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and i could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so i asked her what was bothering her. she confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. this was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. she says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. we talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. i realized i knew i'd never be able to let this go, nor would i be able to forgive her. she's distraught.

we sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. obviously this was extremely tough. they acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. my wife and i agreed to tell them it was mutual, but i guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. this had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. my wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. i don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so i'm being trying to explain as tactfully as i can, but they're gone as far as saying that when i get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that i still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. my wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since i've told her of my plan to leave.

i love my kids, but i don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. i don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that i'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. i just know that i cannot get past this, and for my own happiness i need to leave. any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. i'm leaving. kids hate me for it.",8
"update dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. am i wrong to be angry? original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

you guys are right. i can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. i resent this man so much. i can't stand the sight of him. 

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

edit: i'm not going to ghost or abandon them. they need to become independent now. 

edit:  i'm reading all the comments. i know i have acted like a jerk. i just need some time to collect my thoughts. i might update later.",8
"final update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue. original post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
update post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

so firstly thanks for all of your input. i read and considered every single reply. first i'll update you, then i'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. i want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, i'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and i feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

update: 

i spoke to her in person after i posted my update. from her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. she was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""i don't know, i'll probably tell him that i feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

i said great, all that is understandable. just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

she said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

i thanked her for telling me, and then i called off the wedding entirely. 

she cried, i cried, it was a goddamn mess. she asked where we go from here. i told her i don't know. i don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but i know that the engagement is over, and that **if** i decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. and now i have to decide if **i** want that. do i went to spend another 4 years being undecided? if i'm being honest with myself, i imagine it taking another couple of years before i can trust her again. do i want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? close to 40? 

i told her that i have a lot to think about. 

i spoke to her dad last night. we shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. my ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. she's been crying a lot. i do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

her dad caught wind of the situation on facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. he'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. she told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. he told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. he said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

so that's it. i still have a lot to think about. i know a lot of you guys are telling me that i have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that i still love her and have loved her for a few years now. right now, i'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

as for my reputation, nobody thinks i'm an abuser. it's firmly out there now. her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. i haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. there's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

my family agrees with a lot of you. they're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. just give me some time. i'm not going to make another update post, because i've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe i'll just update this post in a few days after i've decided what to do.",8

if anyone has been in a similar situation, i would love to hear what you have to say.

edit: thank you for all the comments and replies. i am so grateful for all the support. the advice you have provided is amazing.


> it really looks like op is only considering this for financial reasons.

i'm in debt because of i can't afford to provide the basic necessities for my daughter. i live off paychecks and take cash in hand jobs. i skip meals. i don't regret any of it. i would take a bullet for her. this is a really hurtful comment. i just want her to have a better childhood than i did.

 > i'm ashamed to say, i don't know if i want her.

i want to clarify this. i don't know if i will be a good dad. i'm not the model dad. no real education and a criminal record to my name. i think i'm still depressed and i can't get over the fact that my other half is not here with me. i am going to act on the advice and get some therapy. however, i am still not sure if i can raise her.",8
"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",8
"my (25 f) boyfriend (24 m) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote. update: hi everyone, i had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. i'm sorry that i haven't been responding, i posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so i haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. i am still at work so i won't have time until later to read through everything.
i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. it has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt i have been facing. he really had me questioning this entire situation and whether i was overreacting or not. i am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. i can update again afterwards.
thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",8

she tells me she was drunk and it ""just happened"". 
i'm so hurt right now. she's said how sorry she is many times, and i believe her, but i feel so betrayed. 
we've had a great relationship up to this point, i've loved every minute of it. to add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
this hurts me to my core to think that someone i wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. out of all the women i've ever dated she was the one i was least worried about this happening with. 
she tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, i just don't know if i can move on. 
we live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
i just don't know what to do. i still love her to pieces  but idk if i can get past this. 
do i still go on the trip with her? do i try and make this work? i'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

"i f25 received a letter from my mother f49 yesterday in the mail. i've never cried harder. so around a week ago i posted on reddit that i was having issues with my mother. my husband and i took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. we are now working on adopting them. she has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. so i decided to take a step back from her.

i've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. it broke my heart and i broke down in tears. probably the most i've cried in so long.

it was such a heartbreaking letter. she said that ""i was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". it was a full page of just insults. the one that really got to me was ""you've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". i broke down that line. throughout my life all i wanted was to make her proud.

i ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. i'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. i talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. he truly is my rock.

i truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. it broke me down but now i have to pick myself up. i fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. does anyone have any advice? anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",8
"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",8
"my husband constantly bodyshames me. i was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, i'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. he constantly comments on my body and my weight even though i've never asked for his opinion.  i know my body isn't perfect, but i'm working on accepting that. 

actual things he has said to me

1. (a day after i gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - *disgusted tone and expression* ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" by the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""it's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""your thighs are huge. when you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""it's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. it's very noticeable from behind. i'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""i'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. he even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""short and fat isn't a good combination""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",8
"update to my (22f) twin (22f) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23m) of 8 months. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

so i've made a lot of changes in my family life since i posted this a couple weeks ago. i first told everything to my boyfriend. he was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. he also respected that i didn't want her to meet him. 

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",8
"update: i think my (22m) girlfriend (20f) might be cheating on me with my roommate. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",8
"my (21f) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if i got breast augmentation surgery so i have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if i wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

i am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because i know they don't look normal. i just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

i mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when i tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

i 100% plan on going through with the surgery. i told my doctor up front that i did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in april, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.


tl;dr: i have tuberous breasts & the only way to correct it is surgery. my bf completely shot down the idea bc he doesn't want to date a girl with fake boobs.",8
"girlfriend (22f) mad about my (24m) answer to scenario, what do i do? so girlfriend and i had just finished having sex. we were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, i was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" and i mean i say that all the time so i didn't think much of it and i said ""yes, i will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. she kisses me but then says "" so if i turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... i was confused because it was such a random question and i laughed and just said ""i don't know about that, i'd love you as a pet i guess""

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

i'm just confused. she was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. what did i say? i have no idea what exactly she was upset about. am i not looking into this deep enough? i'm genuinely confused as to what i did and how to fix it. i don't want to say something and make it worse.

"update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue. edit: previous post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)

okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. i'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

a friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. she had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. i don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do i even really know the full story yet. she is not really the prank playing type and i guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

it looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. after i started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. i guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

anyway, i texted her and i told her that i knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. she started blowing my phone up apologizing. she said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. she also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that i was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

i just didn't really respond to her. i left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. my family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. i'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

i don't really know where to go from here. i don't know if i should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

i'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. i'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as i'm awake with this jameson. 

tl;dr: this was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",8
"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8
"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex. 


———————————————————

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"my wife is done with sex and im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done? since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. she swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

we have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. no matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

essentially...
- if i try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if i am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

recently ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but im dying inside.

is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? i dont want an affair etc, i want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

wit's end.",8
"boyfriend (21m) kisses me when i'm asleep lol should i tell him i know? so i've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and i found this out pretty early on. he does cute stuff when he thinks i'm asleep. i'm a deep sleeper so i never woke up from it. i couldn't asleep one night and i knew he was walking past me and he blew me a kiss and just said ""love ya bitch"" while he was walking lol. i didn't know what to say because we hadn't said i love you or anything at that point so i just continued to pretend to be asleep. he actually does it all the time!! sometimes he'll give me a kiss on my cheek or arm, or he'll say ""love you babe"". he is so sweet when i'm asleep!! he's not really affectionate like that when i'm awake, he kisses me but he doesn't randomly call me cute or something. and when i'm asleep, he can say ""did you know you're so cute"" like what!!!!???? sometimes i pretend to be asleep because i like hearing it. and he'll tell his friends that he's not a pussy and he's so tough and everything and i'm like 🙄🙄 you literally come to me when i'm sleeping and tell me good night in this sweet voice. i never say anything though 

when he's sitting down doing something random, i just have the strongest urge to go up to him and give him a kiss and be like ""you're cute babe"" and maybe he'll realize that i know. or should i just continue pretending i have no idea???",8
"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",8
"divorce on table because husband and i cant agree on baby's name hello reddit. this title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23f) and my husband (24m). 
we've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. i got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. in the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. he really loved her and he never hid that from me but i thought it was over once she moved away. now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and i can name the second child. when i asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. he doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name our child like that.
thank you! ",8
"(update) my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)

&#x200b;

i don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

i received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. i was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. his mood has been pretty touch and go lately so i was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and i thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

i basically said i know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because i haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. i absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. i stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? you want me to get rid of him?""

i ***explicitly*** said ""no i would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. this is where shit started to hit the fan. he said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that i was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if i was fucking sick in the head.

i fucked up here. i shouldn't have said this but i don't handle confrontation well and i pretty much lost my cool at this point. i told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. he completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (i agree) and started calling me a number of names. he then started to get extremely personal saying i never cared about his little brother and that i'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

that is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. i still cant bellieve it and i don't think i'm ever going to forgive hm for that. like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. he knows exactly how i feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? he can seriously go fuck himself because i'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

he then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes i know i'm basically killing his brother all over again??? i was crying so much at this point i didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. i have no idea where he's gone or where he is and i honestly don't even know if i care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

i still can't believe he reacted the way he did. he was like a completely different person. not once in the four years i've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. i was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as i was.

then this fucking morning i get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for forcing him to remove the tattoo. apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them i've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

what the fuck?!?! i explicitly told him i would never ask him to do that. when i told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. feckin lovely.

i seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. i'm still in total shock and just so confused. i hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. i don't see what i could have done differently? i shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

i'm just at a complete loss right now. a day ago i thought of this guy as my future husband and now i just don't know. i wish i never said anything.

i've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him i've never seen before. im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. how the fuk would we even move froward from this? am i the one in the wrong here for the comment i made? i know i shouldn't have said it but i personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am i supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? anything i sy is just going to sound like i'm lying in response to their negative reactions. i seriously have no idea what im supposed to do here. i feel like this is going to ruin my life.

i just don't fucking know.

"update: 41m questioning sexuality after making a new friend going forward i will be posting updates via my profile. if you'd like to follow me, i invite you. i will post updates as i have them until i have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


update #2 following monday's notre dame game:

leading up to monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download snapchat, which i had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. i bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. he has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

anyway, so monday rolls around, i'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. i knew he'd have other friends there, all of which i'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. i get over there around 2. he has one friend already there and is expecting more. they trickle in and i'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. we cut up after the game, played some pool, james had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. i was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so i could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what i did. i did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. after some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

i asked james if we could talk outside. we walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""i know i kissed you the other day, and i don't know if that was something i should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. i've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and i think i may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" i was absolutely out there now. no turning back, i basically just told him i had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. he didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why i haven't brought it up before now. obviously i told him i had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the kiss! he reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. i could come to him with whatever was on my mind and i just teared up. it wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. i gave him a hug and told him i appreciated that, we sat down and i explained to him how confused i've been these last couple weeks. how this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. i sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. he is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things i said, they were all comforting. he told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. he is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. a few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.i don't know what i would call the gut feeling i had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out with him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  i felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. i have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. he explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but i shouldn't be pressured. i wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. i turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. full on made out for what seemed like ever. it was the most satisfying kiss i've ever had. this where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) i'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

by this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and i had to go. he walked me to my car and we made out a second time before i got in. he told me to get home safe and i did. i texted him to let him know i got home safe and hopped in the shower. i was so emotionally charged that i couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am. i ended up calling out of work tuesday. james and i have plans to hangout again this weekend. he wants to go out for food and a place called topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, i've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. i'm really looking forward to it and i'm just taking things day to day at this point. i know where we stand and i'm happy.

thank you for all of your support. i have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. i just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. you only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. i am learning this myself and i'm telling you, it's liberating.

i'll post any other updates here, above this one.  if anything big happens in the meantime i will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. i was very observant in our interactions, however, i didn't want to be so observant that i overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so i went with the flow and the vibes were great. we hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when i had the opportunity in conversation i mentioned that i had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and i told him that although i hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and i thought i might be curious to try it. i delivered this passively, just so not to put him on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. it felt like the time to make a move but i just didn't do it. we were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and i just didn't do it. it was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time i've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) we got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new nba 2k20 demo on ps4, i'll admit i'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but i kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. at the end of the night, around 11p i went to leave, i had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. i went in for our hug, when i pulled back i kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and i laid it on him, i went right in and kissed him. it was short, i didn't use much tongue, but i pulled back and said ""i guess i can say i've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, i guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, i had one on mine and it was fireworks in my stomach. i played it cool, i left and texted him when i got home that i was home safe and i thanked him again for a good time. he replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. he asked if i wanted to come over monday night for the notre dame game and a cook out, i told him i'd love to and i'll bring some ribs to cook.

we have texted as normal today and i can't tell you how excited i am for monday and to see what happens next. i know i waited awhile to update but i felt like i had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so i wanted to wait until i had more to report. i will post another update in the comment section here after monday.

thank you so much to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. i feel like i'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",8
"update i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding. hey folks.

in proper internetiquette, i'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. i received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. even your scorn, some of you. i'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. but when i said before that i wanted to take all of it in, i meant it. i intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

to the meat and potatoes: **i got my money back.** it wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. it was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. i also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. i was surprised by the bride, but i welcomed it. you should welcome all positivity. i said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. i feel like, thanks to you all, i explored every thread in the tapestry of how i should feel and what i could say. it brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. you saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. you saved me from rash actions and words i wouldn't have been able to take back.

i know some of you will wish i went off. but i want peace, and what's the metaphor? bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? i just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what i'm trying to say is, i know now that i was just as responsible for how terrible an experience i had. this isn't a self-blame thing, i'm not being low-self esteem. the fact of the matter is, i could have said no, and i could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way i was treated. from so many of you i've learned that this is called self-worth. self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

don't get me wrong. i still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. it's their wedding day. and this goes double for people you're very close to. but you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. and yeah, i accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. but from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, i should have reassessed the relationship. measured my value without the context of groom's friendship and focused on that.

i think part of the reason why i took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, i could stand tall as the good friend and person i know i am. maybe some small part of me thought i could prove to the bride that i was someone she should have always counted on. show the groom how a groomsmen should be. this was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. you should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. this can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. i know this now.

so what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? i think he made that clear. if i was so important to groom, i'd have been by his side that day, but i'm not so important, and so i wasn't. this is fine. it was his decision, and i told him myself the day he told me i was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" it's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. certainly not me. not anymore. ultimately, this means i maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. i have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. when you find the right people, there is no chase. and one day, i'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. i don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. we won't have hella cursive name cards.

i want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. i was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. i'm not going to be a doormat, but i'm also not going to be fucking heartless. if people need help and i can help, i will. i'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. i know that i'm a good friend, and a great person, and i'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

i know that i still have my problems and i'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, i want to encourage you: i used to be so self-conscious about myself, i'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because i didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. i used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping i'd go away. i used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. i'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that i still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

i mentioned i was always an overweight person, but i should also say that i've lost 122lbs to date and i'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). at my average weekly rate, i'll hit my goal in less than six months. if you're struggling similarly, i want you to know that you can do it (dm for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). also, this was supposed to be a thing where i counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women i'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or i can't tell if they are (dm your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but i'm not so insecure about it anymore. i know that when women smile at me, it's because i made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. finally, and this is key, i know who my friends are, and i know that i never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). i know that my real friends asked why i was working the wedding. they asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't i the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. they tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed i was down. they invited me in to pictures. they said they wished i'd had a better time. they commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. they told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how i go above and beyond for people. they told me that, at some point, i have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. focus on these kinds of people in your life.

you'll have your lingering questions about this. i'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. if you have more questions, ask them and i'll answer. if you have more advice, i'm all ears.

i just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and i want to live up to that. the heaviness i felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. you helped me feel not alone. i want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. please, treat each other like good friends. if you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please dm this account. i'm here for you.

&#x200b;

tl;dr i got my money back, i learned a thing or two, i'm your friend.

"my 22f boyfriend of 3 years 23m and i just had a huge fight over a tampon. yes. you read that correctly. the subject matter is... a tampon. to preface, i took a plan b recently and with that comes your period. so today i woke up at about 7 am as i began my menstrual cycle. going to skip the tmi, and simply say i had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. i asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. just a straight up ""no i'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" i tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and i really needed his help in that moment as i was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". i started crying bc i'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when i really needed it. he is the reason i currently got my period anyways (plan b). well i guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said i ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. in the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. i know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. i guess i'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. was i being too dramatic or am i justified in wanting to break up over this? his reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. but to play the devil's advocate, he is a d1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before i move out and back home across the country. bc if i decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

edit: he is home from practice. not sorry. not remorseful. still blaming me for doing too much. i can't stop crying. i showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and i'm stupid for taking advice from reddit. i'm heartbroken.

edit 2: i fuckin love reddit man. i'm sitting here crying but every response i read makes me feel a little stronger. i'm the biggest cry baby ever and i really thought i loved this guy. so naturally i'm super sad. but i need this. i needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. thank you guys.

edit 3: ok guys.. tmi warning.. some are saying why didn't i just put some toilet paper in my undies and walk downstairs. i slept naked and woke up to blood all over my legs. ran to the bathroom and didn't want to get up and get blood everywhere. it was coming out profusely and i didn't want to get up until i was able to insert a tampon.",8
"my parents chose their new families over me so i moved in with my aunt. now they want back in. but i hate them hi.

so i 16. moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

my father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. my mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

after all that i became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that i didn't exist and play happy family.

after a year i became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home i would never interact with anyone. both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. i wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon i was labeled as the black sheep of the family. every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. i was just so fed up that i packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. i took a bus and went mia for 4 days. ofcourse the police was called and when i appeared again i hit another lecture.

we got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and i told them i hated them. i called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

in the car i could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. we informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

my parents ways half assed our contact. appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. recently they tried to build more contact up but i was not interested.

i won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did i invite them to the celebration. and on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. i didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. basically i have cut them out of my life.

i am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. she got upset and called me crying and..... i just didn't care. it was like listening to a tv character cry. it wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again i didn't care.

as far as i am concerned my aunt is my only parent. she encourages that i build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. they tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and i just said no and left. i still resent them for choosing a new life over me. but i don't know if i am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. i don't want them in my life but would i be making the right choice? ""idk

edit : because people think o just made it up and i am a moody teen

you know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? that was the feeling i constantly had at their houses.

i know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. my parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. but not in the sense ""i want to have her longer"" but ""i took her last weekend! it's your turn"".

also planing fun activities for the day after i leave. my father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. they had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

they shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

when there are family functions i am often excludes. e.g my dad had a family bbq and didn't invite me 

they forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar starbucks gift card even when they know i don't like starbucks. 

so no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",8
"found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens this has been going on for several years. i live in a small rural neighborhood with an hoa where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. as with most hoas, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. there will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. it really annoys my husband. i just laugh at it

well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. there were a lot of emails sent about this. a lot of drama. i don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

so then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. some people thought it could be deer eating them. there were several theories. the next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. this year it started happening again and people flipped out. all caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

it started out being funny because i'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. but this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

so anyway, you already know what happens. i walk down to the bottom of our property that i don't visit often and i find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

i went inside and told my husband jokingly ""i think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" he got this really weird look on his face and i had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

he confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. he was sneaking out at night to do this. i asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

i don't even know. this makes me really uncomfortable. the man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and i didn't even notice? why wouldn't he just tell me? like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

i don't know what to do. can anyone help me think this through. maybe i'm overreacting but i'm pretty upset

"my 33 m wife 32 f hit me at a family bbq. everybody laughed. i don't think i'd ever felt more pathetic than i did at that moment. we'd gotten into an argument. she wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). i'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. i didn't think i should drive. my sister was also urging me to go. she was standing right there when my wife hit me. it was square across the face. i'd just told her there was no way i was driving since i'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. my wife called me an asshole... then wham...

my sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. everyone around us laughed. maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but i can't say for certain. nevertheless i felt humiliated.

the thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. it started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). it was infrequent at first. she was always super apologetic. over time it escalated. she started throwing and smashing things. screaming. berating me. hitting, kicking, and punching me. i don't even know how it got so bad. it just is and i feel trapped. who in their right minds would believe me? who would ever think she was capable of this? sometimes i feel like i'm hallucinating it all and i'm just losing my mind. she was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? i don't even know.

now people do know and it doesn't even matter. it's funny. i'm funny. it's so fucking funny. look at him getting hit by his wife. so damn funny.

i want to disappear. i would if it weren't for my kids.

i don't even know what my question is. i don't really have one.

is even possible to come back from this? i wish i could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"my38m wife 24f of 3 years, took my daughter14f to visit her parents in russia. wife doesn't want to come back like above. sorry for ranting and any grammar errors i've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. also this is a throwaway so i don't completely dox myself. 

my wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of st. petersburg, russia. 

my wife herself was born there, and came to the us when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (this is not a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). i was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

as she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the us. it just kind of happened that way. (she entered on a f1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the us with my family and one in russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as i have custody. 

as school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. she wanted to bring my daughter with her - i initially was opposed to this - but i caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on whatsapp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and i don't expect constant alerts, but i would have liked a little more of an update. my daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

yesterday morning i had texted my wife that i'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. she read the message but never answered. i told my daughter the same and she never responded. i assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

i had a hellish day at work so i went right to bed so i could be up early to go get them. 
i wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and i look at my phone to message them. i see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 panicked i reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. she finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that i took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - i go off on her through text. she tells me off and stops answering me. 

i reach out to her mom through whatsapp (who doesn't speak english at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

panicked i go to reach out the us consulate in saint petersburg only to find online it was shut down in march and the nearest is in moscow. i reach out to the moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a huge help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

my wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. and her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

what the hell am i supposed to even do with this? the lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",8
"my mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, i need advice so i will try and keep this short.

i have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced i chose to live with her, i have always trusted her and so on.

now we have never been rich, but we got by, i have always worked since i could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

now because of this i quickly started saving my money, pretty much, i would usually save up at least half of what i made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when i moved out and such.

so i turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so i wanted to see how much i had saved.

well you can see where this is going, i looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so i freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so i yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. she started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. i know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, i mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. my dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

well this was 2 weeks ago, i have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

in the meantime i have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

now here is what i said, untill i have every penny back i wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do i doubt i will ever forgive her. i need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",8
"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8
"my fiance took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant. i'm in my late 20s and i got engaged for my fiance (29) who i've been with for 9 years. our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. but recently he brought up that he wants kids. i said no i'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. he got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. i just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

a week later i couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but i couldn't find them anywhere. later that night he wanted to have sex, i said i couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, i supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. for the next few weeks we just used a condom and i didn't take the pill. in hindsight i should have got more when i couldn't find the original pack but i couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

on a few occasions we were having sex i noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so i said stop. the next day i was putting the recycling in the trash, as i was putting it in i seen my pills at the bottom. i instantly knew he had binned them. he knows i deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

it all made sense so i confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. he just kept walking away. i was so mad at him, it's not right. you can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. does he have to carry it for 9 months? 

i haven't been talking to him, i'm so annoyed. ",8
"update my gf likes me to go by different names. tl;dr: most of you were right, she was sleeping with matt.


here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

after i made my post, i waited 2 days to say anything to her because i wanted to get as much input as possible. i also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

i started reading comments right after i posted. i replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, i started to feel sick. i called my boss to ask for friday off for personal reasons. i spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. we don't live together but i wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. we also have some good memories in that apartment and i think i would be sad if i had to continue to live there. 

this brings us to saturday, the day i promised myself i would say something. i invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because i was getting so nervous that i completely lost my appetite. she walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. i was hoping to ease into it, but i ended up blurting out, ""i met matt blank"". she tried to act casual about it, but i could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. for the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, i talked about how i see the past 4 months completely differently. she started to cry and say she was sorry, i don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. i told her i'm going to work on forgiving her, because if i don't i think it will eat me up inside. i won't forget what happened but i'll at least try to move on. she started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. i interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

if i wasn't so emotionally crushed, i would have been amazed at the transition. she started begging me to give her another chance. i stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. i told her that i had already made up my mind to break up with her. after some back and forth, she realized that i was serious. i knew the exact moment she knew i was serious because she went from crying to yelling. it started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. it started off that i was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and i had a useless job. in the middle of her tirade, she said matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

as she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. i'll summarize below:

she started sleeping with matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. from there it went from once in a while to once a week. matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. i think she was using the vacations because she missed being with matt. 

i don't really remember the rest of saturday. i spent sunday with my friends which helped, i told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. i went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. i'm not sure what it said because i burned it. ",8
"my (f 25) boyfriend (m 27) got angry when i asked him if i could put a face mask on him. we were lying in bed and i was putting a face mask on. all i asked was ""can i put some on you?"". i just thought it was fun, i didn't think it was a big deal at all. but, i guess it was emasculating or whatever because he scowled at me and raised his voice saying ""do i look like a bitch to you?"". i said ""no i'm sorry"". i tried to just get him to relax and he did but i could tell he was irritated the rest of the night. he kept glaring at me and his demeanor was colder. it honestly bothered me, i wanted to cry i had to hold in my tears. i hate to be talked to like that by him. why would he snap at me over nothing? i wasn't trying to make him feel like a ""bitch"". i mean jesus christ. i don't know. it hurt my feelings. am i just being sensitive?",8
"i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. i am sick, devastated and don't know what to do. first time poster so i apologize if this is rambly. to preface: i started dating david (not real name obv) at the beginning of february.  only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship i was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that i didn't think much more about it. i fell hard and he did too. things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and i can't afford the place by myself). he and i have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and i have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time i've known him, so i didn't really see any red flags there. everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

last week i came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and i played it off like i had no idea what he was doing. fast forward to two days ago, i was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (i don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. so when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, i quickly peeked through his search history. there was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". i didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then i saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

i quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, i had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. i couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; i know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. so last night i peeked through his photos on his iphone and was traumatized. there were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while i'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. i felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

a bit further up in his photos i discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. they all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. i was numb, i was angry, i was devastated, i couldn't think and i was so disturbed at what i was witnessing. i have never seen cp in my life and i can't get these horrible images out of my head. i scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

i guess i'm just posting here because i have no idea what else to do. i don't know how to confront him and i know i must separate from him immediately but i'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and i don't want to get in trouble. he must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  he practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially i am fucked by this. 


please help reddit, i feel so lost.

tldr: i discovered cp on my boyfriends phone last night. not sure how to proceed with anything.",8

the kids came home, and kept mentioning ""my poke"" ...... 

so he asked me if they got vaccines and i came clean. i said yes, and told him they started last year.

i apologized for not telling him. he wasn't happy.

no yelling, we talked more, and i explained the recent measles outbreaks nearby and expressed my concern for our kids.

all is well. no, we didn't even raise voices. yes we kissed and made up.

"i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - update hey! a week ago i posted about the fact that i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and i wasn't sure where to go from there. i was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! i think i was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.' 

god he's great. anyway, sorry it's nothing too exciting but i had a few pm's asking for an update so i wanted to let you know :) i'm really happy with the outcome and i'm sure we'll be good friends at the very least.",8
"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8

"my (22m) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together update on the bottom

update #2 on the bottom

update #3 on the bottom

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

edit: when i brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying i always do this?? idek what she even means by this



update: she dmd me this (im out rn) 
https://imgur.com/a/psbp9l6

update 2: i went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

update 3: didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and i found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. well with the gf, i am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now i have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

"update: my babies and i escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3am last night... i'm scared, my kids are confused... i don't even know how i feel right now but nothing seems real. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. i was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

a little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

the dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. my kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". he asks for daddy nightly saying ""i just want daddy be happy. i just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but i just tell him i love him and hold him when he is hurting. i realized even being here i am happier than i ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. i don't feel like i'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

the shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. my 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and i've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

they have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. the attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. they are also filing a long term protective order. 

we have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

i will be starting work again next week. my hr manager contacted the store up where i am now to have me transferred because of the situation. i am so thankful the company i work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though i've had to take the last few weeks off while i get things in order. 

the shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on wednesday for both children while i start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. the daycare facility is wonderful and i'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while i start work again! 

since i am able to start work again too i was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

i was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. i was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

a detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while i handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. the detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. so, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a class c family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when i was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a class a and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

he has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying i kidnapped the children and also filed a false cps report. i handed over all evidence to cps as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. he did text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but i didn't respond. if i even let him see the children until things get worked out i risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

his mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to florida so i would never see them again.... 

so, things are moving along. it has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but i've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. i feel like things are pulling together even faster than i imagined. it's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes i just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

i hope one day i can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources are available. it's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what i ever could have imagined and hoped for and i will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

"husband (31m) refuses to let me (23f) have a day off from the kids me and my husband have been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids together (3 yr old and a 7 month old). i've been a sahm ever since we had our first kid and things have been going well for us. 

i moved away from home to be with him and i don't know anyone here. all of my outings have been with my husband. this weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and i told my husband i would love to have some time off so that i can meet up with her. he flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. his reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. am i wrong to be upset over his reaction?

edit: i'm so overwhelmed with the number of comments here + pms i've gotten. i can't thank you all enough. some of the questions hit close (like not having access to money, making a big deal over having any contact with friends/family) i didn't realize that i may be in a bad place. i'm sorry i'm not able to reply to you all!",8
"update my 30m wife 29f more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. i don't know what to do. here is my original post:  here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0c1kd/my_30m_wife_29f_more_or_less_abandoned_me_and_the/)

i wanted to thank everyone for your help. this isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

a few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in english that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. but she thanked me and told me she loved me.

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

i still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. i don't really know how to feel about this at all. 

just wanted to thank you all for the help and support.",8
"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

edit3: some questions have come up.

i don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. i mostly uber arround

i worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and i don't anylonger

i don't work for my father i am a company shareholder and i have to go to the general quartal meetings but i don't work for him.

i am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. it was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. by pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

last edit : i am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. guess what. it's not fucking funny. you don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. you don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. i don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but i don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. it was deeply hurt full.",8
"my wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. i'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like i'm being unreasonable. advice? obviously, i keep some guns. just for hunting and sport shooting.

i've got four rifles right now and i keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. after some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why i like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

so over the last couple months i have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. she's been learning a lot and doing a great job. and she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

she had a friend come over this morning. i already don't have a high opinion of this friend. i think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. i've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. but she's at least harmless so i never worried about her too much.

so this friend came over today. i figured the ladies would just chill out or something and i kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so i didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

at some point i saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but i didn't think much of it. half an hour later i heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

i freaked a little and ran into the barn. i found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

in the immediate moment, after i saw the ladies were okay, i took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

so with all that sorted, i wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, i started to get mad.

i'm not necessarily proud of the language i used, but i'll try and portray it accurately since i am asking you alls opinions.

i asked the girls ""why. the. *fuck*. was one of my guns pulled out?""

friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

so then i asked why it was loaded. i *know* i clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so i know there wasn't a round in there. and i keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

they were making a ""woops!"" face that kind ignorant upset me more. and it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-i don't know, i stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

i locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

she approached me and just said ""sorry"". i was still mad so i told her something like ""yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

and then i asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. i know she knows better because i taught her!

i told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

my wife started getting defensive. she told me i've taken her shooting on our property before. the effect was the same here, right.

i told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. we *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. and i got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

my wife finally said it was just an accident and i didn't have to make such a deal over it, i told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

she walked away and as she did i said something to her like ""do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" she got re-pissed at that and asked why i'm treating her like i'm her ""dad"". i told her that those guns are registered to me and i don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

and thats where we've been all day. we're kind of just avoiding each other. that sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. she is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. this is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake i probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

i *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because i never do that. and what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. so i'll probably apologize for the cussing here once i'm a little less angry.

so what should i do to handle this now? first big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. i don't want to talk down to her, but i do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or i'm not sure i'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. there is also the matter of her friend. like i said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. that is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but i've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

how should i approach this? how do i get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can i get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like i'm trying to be her dad?

**tl;dr**: my wife pulled out one of my rifles without my permission, gave it to her friend, who then fired it negligently. i'm super pissed, wife is pissed that i'm pissed, and it's all a mess now. help?",8
"my boyfriend (21m) hates my (20f) vagina with a passion i recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. he said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. he gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so i didn't push him to continue until i finished and i said he could stop. he doesn't like fingering me either. he basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. he said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

so i thought i had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. my inner labia are not long or stick out and i'm an innie or whatever. i taste and smell fine. i think he just doesn't like vaginas. but he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. no attention down there. i do cum but i have to touch myself because he won't do it. it's just basically like he's having sex with me and i'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so i can get off too. i don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? he's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when i wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. he just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. his penis is not beautiful i still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. idk it's weird. 

my friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. my friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. my friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. my boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. my boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if i get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if i drip onto his sheets and dirty them. he will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. i get jealous sometimes. i wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. it sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. it's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. he's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. g",8

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments. 

the cops are yet to show up. 

edit 4: guys we forgot to ask for the key back. fucking damn itttt

"i (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f) so our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so i gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. turned out to be new activations, no big deal. although, while on the main page i noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. i expect her to have a lot of texts. i got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when i text her at work cause shes busy.....who could she be texting? i decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

i honestly dont know what to think. my curiosity got to me and i started plowing through old phone bills. this number started showing up on august the 8th. since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. often into the wee hours of the morning. shes never mentioned any new friends... 

so i get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and i start helping her find it. i found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. i hate being that guy but i did it. checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. some dude . she has him programmed first and last name. checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and i also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

i love my wife and i trust her completely, i think. i dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. and actually now that i think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 i really dont like the direction this is heading. am i reading to much into this? we've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. we havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. not for lack of trying on my part. shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. anyone have any advice?

tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since august; shits pointing towards infidelity but i'm trying to rationalize her actions...",8

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy! when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",8
"insecure gf caught flirting throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes. 

not even 2 full days into 2019 and i'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

username checks out. 

do i ask for advice now or am i on the right track. i need clarity...

thank you for making it this far. 

tldr - girlfriend who made me end friendships due to her insecurity ends up flirting with a guy she met 3 days ago and accusing me of being insecure about it. her texts determined that was a lie.  breaking up with her unless i'm overreacting.",8
"updatei (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). my mom was raped. i don't know how to handle this. i posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. i finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and i wasn't prepared for it.

we were alone and i just asked if she loved me. i called her mom for first time in months. i wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. i just ranted to her without letting her speak. how i needed her attention and it's affecting me. i played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. i asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. i would stay out late just so that she would call me. i flipped and told her she should have never had me. i fucked up.

i made my mom cry that night.

she told me that she did love me. 

she revealed that she was raped by my dad. he was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. she became depressed and carried me full term. she is still recovering from her depression. my grandparents wanted her and i to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. at first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. this is why she has been distant from me. she doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. in the end she just gave up. i remind her of her rapist but she knows that i am gentle and kind. i didn't know what to say, i just hugged her. it was a hard truth to swallow. i told her that i will always be there for her. she told she didn't know i was hurting inside. i told her we can start again from scratch.

my mom joked that i scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. i cried as i went to sleep. i can't blame her anymore and i should make a better effort to be more involved with her. i want to support her. i'm not going to break off contact with her. i going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

i'll try my best to be a good son. thanks for the advice.

i wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

edit: thank you for all the support. i will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

"i 29m got informed that the girl 23f i'm dating is trans and started hrt 2 years ago. the source also informed me that she hasn't had an operation yet. she avoids us taking each others clothes off. how do i let her know that i'm completely okay with her being pre-op mtf? i still like her and she is a woman to me. what she used to be doesn't matter to me.
i'm straight but i'm sure there are ways to work around her having a penis. 
i feel bad for her being so scared that she felt she had to hide this from me. 
i want her to trust me wholeheartedly.
what can i do to let her open up to me about it?",8
"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this? i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. we'll take all the positive energy we can get.",8
"my (18m) girlfriend (f17), is threatening to kill herself every time i express discomfort, and today when i got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself i feel extremely trapped at this point. she was such a great person when i met her and i thought we would be great together.

unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. for example, i could not hear a line of what she said over facetime because of internet issues and she flipped saying i don't pay attention to her. proceeded to call me names or whatnot. usually, i just took and it moved on. however, today i just snapped and told her to leave me alone. so i proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and i check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

i just ignore it because i really did not feel like it.  then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. i honestly think i'm traumatized from those videos, i can't seem to get them out of my head and i feel responsible for them. i texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. thankfully she's still alive and i've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but i don't feel right. 

i feel trapped, and very fucking sad. i feel as if i'm a monster and i'm causing her to do these things to herself. i never say anything badly to her, i just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. i apologize for my rant but i don't know. my emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

i hope i can get some advice. for some insight, i don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. she gets annoyed that i don't give her attention, but i text her and hang out with her as much as i can possibly give, i am human and a student with responsibilities, i can't spend 24 hours with her.  

that's really all. 

update: 
just a slight update. i have been in contact with her father and i am being updated on what's happening. they are seeking professional help for her and i feel that is the right choice for her. i am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so i'll try and give updates as i can. fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. in my case, i've decided it's going to do me harm if i continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

my mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and i'd much rather regain my positive nature. i am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. i've read every story and the decision i made has been influenced by your own experiences. i will try and reply to all the messages, but i apologize if i miss anything. i'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. i have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and i hope she comes to see what i chose to do a few years from now.

thank you!
if my spelling or grammar sucks, i'm pretty exhausted, i apologize.

"update i 25m got ghosted by my girlfriend 23f of 2 years. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvawkw/i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

i can't say hearing all this helps. i don't really even have much closure. but people wanted me to update and so i did.

thanks for all your help guys. wish it was more interesting than it really was.",8
"my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry? my wife and i are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

when i was in my 20s i donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (i literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). i've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. always. and she has always said she's okay with it.

fast forward to yesterday i answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" obviously i have no idea what the fuck is going on, so i ask her to explain what she's talking about.

turns out this girl is my daughter (i understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when i didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. after turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. she called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. apparently my wife told her that i wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

i tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that i did not say any of that. we organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night i blew up at her. honestly, i've never yelled at anyone as long as i can remember, but i couldn't hold it in. 

am i wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? i honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. i'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.",8
"i 22f read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me. i honestly don't even know where to start here... i haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because i function better when i'm not around my family all the time.  i think and function differently from them, which is something i thought was ok and not a source of conflict until this morning.  i'm moving in a month for grad school so i moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  the entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  it's been really upsetting but i've tried to push it aside.  i've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

i am aware that what i did was wrong / i shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so i opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  i don't know what exactly i was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, i don't know, but i was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* i am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know i can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  i'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  my mom says things like ""it's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch i have ever met.""  they say i bring down the mood, i walk into the room and i'm a bitch, etc.

there are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying i'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  so while i'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable i am.

i think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  i came out to her in december after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the lgbtq+ community and i was terrified to tell anyone.  i told her i wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  they are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

growing up i was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what i was supposed to.  i am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  i've also worked since i was fourteen.  i pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  in college i had a 4.0 and i got into multiple top phd programs straight out of undergrad.  i won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  i am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

i know snooping was wrong and i'm not sure what i expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  i've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but i tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  but these were not mere hunches, they are true.  i feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and i'm honestly not sure how i should proceed from here.  should i try to bring things up with my family?  should i just bide my time for the next few weeks until i move?

tldr: i knew my family was talking about me behind my back so i read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

&#x200b;

**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  i initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  i am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and pms offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know i see you and appreciate you very much!

some people have shared that i've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  i want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  i was simply trying to share that i've had multiple achievements that i would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**edit 2:** just going to answer a few of the common questions i'm seeing in the comments here.

* yes, my family is religious.  they are catholic.  i am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* no, i do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  in fact, i hardly talk politics.  i do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  when my parents are talking politics, i merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  i pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles i prefer to have.
* yes, i have friends.  no, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  i generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* my relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* no, i am not adopted. 

&#x200b;

**edit 3:** copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  a lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  here's a bit more context that i definitely should have provided earlier:

the issues with my sister started after i came out to her! this is definitely something i should have clarified, i'm sorry. here's the story:

i was dating this really awesome girl in december who has been out and proud since middle school. i was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so i decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. i figured baby steps were the way to go, so i started with my sister. my sister and i have told each other a lot of private information in the past and i thought i could trust her with this. i was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. however, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. so i figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. i told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. but after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. she began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and i felt like i had some support with them. but once i came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

in early july, we were at our cousins' house and i was in the bathroom. the house is small with thin walls and i overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. so i realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. at this point i realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but i still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. well, she did. i'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

i'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. well, here is some more. this situation is complex and something i am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that i am in the dark here as well.",8
"update 2 my ex girlfriend (21f) spent the night at a random guys house. sorry for making another post but i got a ton of messages saying what did she say etc. like 30 so i'll just make a quick post

yeah idk if i should talk to her when she gets back or just ignore her. i kind of just wanna be done with her. even if she didn't cheat it's not right to be in bed with someone else and stuff that's not ok",8
"i (29m) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28f) rich family my girlfriend and i have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. she's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. but every time we visit her family i start doubting everything. 

they are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. i come from a very middle class background. i have a good education and a decent career that i really enjoy, but i'm definitely not rich. because of this, they view me as a loser.

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",8
"my boyfriend told an old crush of his that he's single. we've been together just over a year now. i went on his computer (facebook was already open on a tab) and i saw he was talking to an old crush of his. she said she was single and when she asked him whether he was in a relationship he said that he wasn't. she even asked him why and he said he didn't know. i don't know what to think now because this seems really out of character for him.

edit: we broke up.",8
"update gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

short edit at bottom.
&nbsp; 

we met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. i was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so i suggested we meet at her place, so that i could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

even though i thought i made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my gfs coworkers figured out who the post was about (gf's age, working hr which i mentioned in a comment, same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my gf. the reason she wanted to meet early was because she was furious that i had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' in a sense, i guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. my gf never used reddit so i figured i was safe.
there's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that i made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. i asked her to point out any part of it that wasn't true, or where i had lied. long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. i definitely raised my voice when i told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. i told her i only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. the post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

she began to tear up and asked me if i really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. i asked her if she understood that this wasn't about the keyboard. it was about the way she acted towards me when i was trying to do her a favor. she stayed silent and didn't answer. i asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was ok with her. i asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

she got really defensive, asking ""are you calling me crazy?"" and ""do you think i'm unstable?"" i had no idea where she was going with this. i told her i wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that i was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

we talked in circles for a bit, and i tried to pry it out of her. i still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. when i realized our conversation was going nowhere, i finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. she asked, ""what do you want from me?"" and i said, ""i want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

i'm getting tired of typing so i'll wrap this up quickly. she was absolutely unwilling to apologize. she thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. we talked for about 5 more minutes before i told her that i don't even care anymore. i told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. that we should just break up. i didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

as i was leaving, she asked if i wanted the keyboard back. she didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. i could tell by her tone of voice. i told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

i've been getting tons of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my fb). she obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like i really did leave her over the keyboard. i couldn't care less, as i'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

we only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, i don't feel terribly heartbroken. mostly just relief that it's over. but...also confusion. still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

tl;dr: she wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. after an exhausting conversation, i decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**and to the people who had some unkind words towards me because i use a razer keyboard: pound sand, dorks. i like what i like.**

very short edit: she called earlier today and was very apologetic. my assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how i was right for leaving her, among other things. i told her that she had her chance to apologize.",8
"girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time"" so before your read, i need to say i have nothing against cuddling to sleep. i actually love it.

the problem i have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

and honestly i wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

but no, she doesn't want it like that. she absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

if i just start to get sleepy (wich i am because i want to sleep), she will get upset.

she absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because i have to keep my eyes open too.

she also needs sweet talk, wich i like but not when it's forced like that. she literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""i love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what i think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... and honestly i have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. and we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like i never say it.

but the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. and that can take some time. sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

i know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with so, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when i tell her i'm tired and i want to sleep.

if i say i'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""no ! don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so i have no say in it.

seriously, i think she's just being too clingy and childish. is it unreasonable to just say ""good night i love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? i don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if i don't do enough.

i feel like i have no control over when i can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for several hours.

honestly i wish i could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but i can't. it's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when i'm tired.

could i have some insight ? what do you think ? am i being unreasonable ?

thanks for reading.

**edit: thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, i will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. i feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now i'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. i will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

"boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship my bf and i have been together for over 4 years. when we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. we stayed together long distance until i graduated and moved back home. we have lived together for about 2 years now. 

life was very rough for him when he dropped out. his parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. he is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. because of this, i have lent him money over the years. i was very fortunate in my situation where i went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. i have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. one thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. i am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. he told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. my perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (for example, we moved last week and i wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) it makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. but he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

i am very confused about our relationship right now. he will not remember this when he wakes up, but i don't know how to approach him with the things he said. i love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. but if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should i be doing?

edit: i've changed the ocd to perfectionist. i'm so sorry to everyone i offended!

edit 2: i'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. thank you to everyone who responded, i love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

a little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. that was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",8
"update: i 34m broke up with my 33f girlfriend in the nastiest way possible because of what happened yesterday and today. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

so after i went home yesterday, i cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

i called her, she accepted my call and said ""what?"" i told her ""i'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

i texted her, ""i need the copy of my house keys back, i'm breaking up with you.""

she didn't respond. i got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

i looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. so i texted her ""where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

i drove back home and i noticed her car parked next to my house, i carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there i see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my ipad...) that's when i tell her ""what are you doing?"" 

she tells me, ""i'm taking back what's mine."" that's when i tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""get off me."" she started kicking me and ran out the house.

i tell her to give my shit back or i will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so i whip out my phone and dial the cops.

she drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my ipad.

cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and i told them what happened and i tell them the location of her house.

they sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

the cops start asking me questions like ""is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later i got my stuff back.
she has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

now i'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

edit: for everyone questioning of how she got arrested on the same day, she let the cops in and confessed what she has done.",8

&#x200b;

we spoke via text and then i called her at lunch. it escalated where i was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that i should trust her.

&#x200b;

i stated they can be friends, but i expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something i'm comfortable with, and i try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because i know better.

i expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

she doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200b;

i don't think she cheated. i know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. some men are okay with that, i'm evidently not.

"update: i'm 37/f unexpectedly pregnant. my husband (35/m) wants an abortion and to keep it quiet. i'm not comfortable with this. what should i do? my original post was some time ago, so newcomers may not have seen it. 

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



i wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. first though, i'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. for the most part the community came through with useful advice. i really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. i thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


an now on to the update. i'm 39 now and my husband is 37. i was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. i told the therapist about the advice i got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. i went through with the pregnancy. my husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. he decided to stay. 


not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. i see the world in a different way now that i have her. he loves our daughter with every bit of himself. amazingly my love has grown for this man. he has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. i understand what he means. the happiness that i feel is beyond words. both my husband and i are so thankful that we had our daughter. we talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. to top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


so thank you, reddit. your support helped me through a difficult time. i hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


edit: holy schmoly reddit. pinned and gilded for the first time! thank you for the gold, kind stranger. thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. i have read and appreciate every one of them. i'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!).

"my husband committed suicide saturday and i'm wondering how to handle this regarding our 2 year old i absolutely don't want him to know that he took his own life... ever... i'm sure that's a conversation to be had when he's much much older. like an adult. i don't know. but i'm confused right now. i want to show him pictures but is that wrong?? is reminding him everyday harder? he's been saying ""i want my daddy to be here"" or ""my daddy is at work"" and he doesn't seem sad. just confused. i know he feels all of this. my mother told me it's a bad idea to show him pictures constantly. i just feel like... i don't want him to forget his dad. this has been so hard. i just need some guidance. i start counseling monday but i need other opinions. this morning we sat here and looked at tons of pictures of daddy and he smiled and seemed so happy. what do i do... i just want to be strong and do the right thing so my bubba feels loved and happy.",8
"my mother (50f) asks me (20f) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15m) hi everyone,

this morning i was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. she has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. he is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. he does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. if he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. i would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. he has just not grown up. my birthday day out to london was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and i was called selfish as a result. i am 20, i've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. yesterday, she called me to ask if i would come home from uni on wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. a sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. i am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. she had been preparing for this for a while. i said i wasn't happy about it, but i didn't have plans that day, so fine.

this morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. i thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. but actually she now wants me to come back tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. tuesday evening is the only time i get to see my boyfriend this week, so i said no. the reason she wants me to come back is so i can wake my brother up for school wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. i told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. at this point i just said i wasn't having this conversation and hung up. i then text her to explain that i don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, i have a busy day on tuesday, and it's just not practical. plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. i shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

so, am i being unreasonable? i understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. i am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. if my brother had to be left alone for days of course i would come back, or if something sudden happened. but he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. he should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

any advice at all would help.

tldr: my mum is going to a funeral on wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 yo brother up for school. she has a history of babying him and i'm a university student with my own life in a different city. am i wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as i have other plans? edit: typo. 

update: i called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that i was a disappointment to the family. he said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do i should always help where i can- it was the principle that counts. he also said i was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot i should be doing at 20 that i'm not. when i asked what i should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as i live in a big city and the only reason i'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when i can easily bus/train everywhere. he knows this. he then repeated he was disappointed in me and i hung up the phone, upset, after saying i don't know want more they want me to do. i had a job i've saved my wages from so i can budget accordingly, i do well at university, i am good with money, i have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, i make time to see my parents when i can. currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. thank you for your support though, everyone",8
"thinking about abandoning pregnant gf... my gf is pregnant and i was really excited to be a dad when i first got the news. problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of down syndrome. a follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has down syndrome.

i want an abortion because i am not prepared to raise a child with down syndrome. this is not me bashing down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something i'm prepared to do. my gf doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing i can do about that.

at this point i'm considering just ending the relationship. i'd pay whatever i'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. my gf obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but i feel like i have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

anyway, i'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my gf. i obviously have to tell her asap so that she can make an informed decision.  but i don't want to come across as manipulative.

i realise i'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but i genuinely care about my gf and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",8
"update: i 22f just found out my boyfriend 27m has been having sex with me when i'm sleeping after i've taken sleeping pills. previous post can be found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the tl;dr is in the title. i have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. i'm pretty much dead to the world when i take them. recently, about 2 weeks ago, i found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while i was knocked out despite me saying that i wasn't up for sex before i fell asleep. i woke up that day because i was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. he didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200b;

now for the update. after i found out what happened, i went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. i'm so incredibly lucky to have him. it was from his house that i made the last post. after that post, i was replying to the comments until i fell asleep. the majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that i need to break up with him and report him to the police. that was something i didn't wasn't to have to do. when i woke up in the morning, i had almost 600 more replies and i got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what i was going to do. so that is exactly what i did.

&#x200b;

i had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. i wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why i wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. i went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200b;

so i called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. i started to explain everything to him and why i had to go away for a while. the conversation was going okay at the beginning. but then it took a turn. as soon as i brought up the fact that i wold him no to sex before i feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. he started yelling. he started throwing things. he got scary violent. telling me that he knew i was insinuating that he had raped me. saying i was accusing him of something very serious. i hadn't said to him that he had raped me. i hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that i was going to give him another chance.

&#x200b;

then things took another turn. in my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. i don't want to come off that way so i am not going to disclose what happened. i'm still trying to process everything and wondering how i could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200b;

i just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. you have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me i was the one who was wrong. i'm sorry i didn't listen to you guys. i was wrong. but i think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision i had made. maybe it was better that way because now i know for sure. i don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now i'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200b;

again, thank you.

&#x200b;

edit: some people have asked of he is now my ex. i guess i didn't really directly say that he is. we are no longer together. and never will be again. even if i decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

edit 2: it's come up a lot. people are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. my brother did report him. another thing people keep asking is what happened. call me an attention seeker if you want. i don't care anymore. what i left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. if my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. it's so embarrassing, not just that i was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",8
"(update):my mil exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). who had no idea. wants him to divorce me. please help me. tldr: mil told my husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where i wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. hubby and i are solid. she then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the christian thing. 

hi guys, i just wanted to give you a quick update about a post i made 5 days ago on here. you were very kind to me. thank you. it got locked and deleted because i had the wrong username so i've just made another account and added the ""throwra"" to my normal username lullabelleanabelle, so i can make a quick update for this subreddit. i'm not sure if i'm allowed to link to my post because i posted it on another subreddit too. a lot of you suggested i go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. thank you everyone. you're wonderful. 

to clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if i may). i'm not american, european born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. we met at his friend's wedding where i did the bride's makeup (i'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). we had some serious words, mostly where i told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and i fell hard. and you guys are so right, he is the best person i have ever met. he's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. and he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. so i think i'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. he's just my world. 

it hasn't been easy. a few things have happened and i can't honestly say that i'm better off for it. but i'm trying.  again, really not a troll post. i'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. this is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

i didn't know how to tell him. or what i wanted to tell him. a bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, i didn't want to show him ever. so, i told him i could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. they aren't particularly easy to read. those men weren't very nice to me. they had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. and they had gone to jail. 

he got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. that i didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if i didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second i was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. he'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. he wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. he said he was so scared that i would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. and he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. they were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. nothing malicious or accusing. 

i thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. she'd taken pictures of the parts where i described things that had happened almost too vividly and then i had pointed out ways i could have defended myself and questioned why i hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way i looked and wanting them to do those things to me. its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. it was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so i didn't have to think about the ways i could have stopped it. maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all i had, i never went to therapy. she put in her message that i had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof i was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

his sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. and to the other siblings and some others in the family. fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

things haven't been going well. my husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. he's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. he won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. he owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. but i'm trying to get him to not do that. it's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. i don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

as for me, i'm just in a fog. i don't know how to process what she did, so i'm not going to until i'm ready. my husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. i think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. i'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. it sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. i hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows i thought like that about myself. i never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. its just shit. 

i won't be posting on here again. 
thank you all for your lovely words. i hope you take care.

edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. and thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much i must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. no.",8
"i(f32) just found out that my husband(m36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(f29) "" just knocked on my door. sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. i am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

i thought that i had a pretty happy marriage with ""jonas"". we have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. we have twins (f8).

jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. during this time he will visit us and we will visit him. it is i convinient but he earns really good. so good so that i needn't work if i didn't want to.

during all those years i have never suspected him if cheating. he was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

so this comes all of the blue for me. jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
a woman knocked on my door. she introduces herself as ""cherry"". when i asked her what it was about she broke down crying. i took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about jonas. apparently she and jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

we were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. he has 2 different sets of social media accounts. and as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

at first i was livid and screamed at her. till i calmed down as she was just a victim.

apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if i visit) trough some bank statements. she searched his keys and went snooping. there is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

we both cried our eyes out together. cursed out jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

she is not legally married to jonas as he sold her the ""i don't believe in marriage spiel"". the only legal spouse he has is me. i know i have to divorce him but maybe i just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. also should i keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

edit : i guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

thanks for the few helpful advices i have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. i honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but i guess it's if i wanted that i needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

thanks for the people that did tho. cherry has left and i will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. i will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",8
"should i end my relationship with my gf for ruining my birthday? this may sound petty, but i am genuinely pissed and don't know how to handle this situation.  i don't usually do much for my birthday, just normally go out to eat.  yesterday being my birthday, i asked my girlfriend if we could dine out at one of the local mexican restaurants on my town after i got off work.  she said probably not, as she was going to be pretty busy that day, which is understandable as she is currently going to school and is nearing midterms.  a couple of hours after getting home from work, i got a call from her asking to pick her up from the very restaurant i asked if we could go to, as she went out with her friends and got a little tipsy.  i of course went ahead to pick her up, as i didn't want her to drive home drunk.  i haven't said a word to her since, and she doesn't seem to understand what's wrong.  i feel hurt and unloved, and don't know how to approach this.",8
"update to caught my (27m) girlfriend (24f) masturbating and she started crying original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bt4yar/caught_my_girlfriend_24f_masturbating_and_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

damn i got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. reading your comments made me realize that i'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. she didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which i relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. but it was different in my house, they knew or assumed i would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. i got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. she told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

it was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. no judgment, it was nice, i missed her. basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. she tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. so when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

and then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when i saw her, she felt embarrassed. she admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. i told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. obviously i didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. i tried telling her that i knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and i still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. so that's that. she didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. i know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and i said that it was so hot and i wanna watch her. she felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. we're good now. had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

thanks for all the help. i knew i wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. we talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. that's definitely not it lol. and just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. i did not make that post thinking ""wow my bitch girlfriend has double standards, i should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for weeks, how fucking dare she, i'm gonna get revenge"". i love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. i can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. and the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. again, real lack of empathy. no one's perfect, everyone has their own problems.",8
"i m28 just broke up with my girlfriend over something she f27 posted on facebook. justified? did i overreact? so we've been together about 7 months. we've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. but something i found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much i ended our relationship.

some backstory for context: about 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. it started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. we both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

fast forward to tonight. we're laying in bed and i realize i never accepted her facebook friend request. i literally never use facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. but we weren't doing anything else so i decided to accept the request and check out her facebook (she was right next to me the whole time).

what i found really upset me. multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. they were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

the first one i found was this: ""hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... like they are important to you..."" i think ""hmm, is this about me?"" i feel like i make her feel important all the time. i drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. she had a birthday and i did all the things that you would expect: multiple presents, dinner, i offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. i often buy her things just because. i offer her lunch nearly every day to show i'm thinking about her...

ok, maybe i'm overreacting on that one i think. that post could be about anything or anyone, so i keep scrolling. i see another one: ""if you push me away, i promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. and i was a bit upset at seeing it. especially considering i never felt like i was pushing her away. i spend literally every free moment i have with her. she got upset that i wanted some alone time. she says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why i need it, so i pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. we are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. i never felt like i was pushing her away. if anything, i felt like i spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

i keep scrolling, and i found the one that hurt me the most: ""don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. what you won't do, someone else will.""

that one absolutely killed me. i never thought i was taking her for granted. and the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. on top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than i do...

i confronted her about these posts. she said they don't mean anything. that she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

i took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then i went back through our text messages to each other. turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. that last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

it just felt so terrible. like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? that's what it seems like to me. am i out of my mind for thinking that? she made me feel like i was. she said i was overreacting. that she felt that way in the moment, but not now. but i can't stop myself from thinking ""if you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on facebook. anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. by sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""i'm having relationship problems!!!"". i can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (they were all posted within this past month). to an outsider, i must seem like a fucking asshole. not treating her right. not respecting her. not making her feel important.

i just felt disgusted. i felt like i was going to vomit. i just kept seeing the words ""what you won't do, someone else will"". i know she didn't write them. but she thought them. she agreed with them. she broadcast them to the world.

i told her i knew myself well enough to know i wouldn't forget it. that anytime we had any minor argument, i would be thinking ""guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than i do"". i don't think i could deal with it. knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

i broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. it was ugly. i feel bad. i feel tired. i've had no sleep and i have to work in like 3 hours. i don't even know why i'm posting this. the relationship is over. maybe i overreacted, maybe i was justified. i just know it felt right.

edit: lots of people saying i jumped to conclusions. i do not feel i did. the conversation went like this:

me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? there is a lot of them. (this was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

her: why? do you not like that i do that?

me: i mean... it kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

her: but those posts could mean anything. they could be about anyone.

me: i just have a feeling that if i went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

her: yeah, maybe some of them...

we left it at that for about 10 minutes, then i decided to actually check those times and dates. they all lined up, i went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. i stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

i then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. i may have jumped to a conclusion, but imo it wasn't a very far leap. and she confirmed that i was right.",8
"fiance has dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn't know he has them and women he's said he's never been with. me: 30f
fiance: 38m

we've been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. when i asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

this past week, i was playing a game we play together on his ipad when a questionable text came in. i went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. being really angry and insecure about it i then went through his phone. we have access to each other's phones to play each other's dumb games when one of us isn't felling well but i have always respected his privacy up until this point.

what i discovered was a dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women's initials. in each folder was pictures of nudes his ex's and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while i was so black out drunk i couldn't remember them being taken. 

several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that i had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and i love you's. 

after some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. he is an it professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

i checked through time stamps and i don't believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. i am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker's privacy as well.  he insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. i feel like i'd be very disturbed if i were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

regarding the original girl, he just didn't want to tell me because he thought i'd be mad. i am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  after we hashed this out, i asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there's anything else i should know and i wouldn't get mad. he lied. two days later i found this personal ""porn"" stash. 

i am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. am i making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? is this grounds for ending the engagement? the relationship as a whole? part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time i just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn't be restored. 

he claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which i'm sure i can believe but i don't have any experience with this but i'm just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that i don't know how to make a rational decision right now.

edit: first i want to thank everyone reaching out. this relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but i was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. i can't help but doubt myself even though i know in my heart that this just isn't right. i'm shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. i feel like i can't even turn to my own friends and family because i'm embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. i probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason i always felt like i was to blame. what's going on is beyond not ok and i am now figuring out what my next steps will be. thank you again for all of the support.

edit #2: regarding the ""secret porn stash,"" it wasn't porn from the internet. i was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. i was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. i was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. it was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed.",8
"update i (19f) snooped on my brother (23m) and found something horrifying link to previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf6oib/i_snooped_on_my_brother_and_found_something/)

we just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. i know i said in the last post that i wasn't going to do anything about it, but i found that i couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

so i spoke to my brother.

we were alone, though our mother was in the house. it filled with lots of crying. he basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. i only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. i told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

he asked that i not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. sounded fair, so i agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

in a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. not sure how to better describe it. we most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and i hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. i'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones i ever had. 

hopefully this is the only update i need, and thanks for listening :)",8
"daughter's friend (f18) is making me (m45) uncomfortable i have known this girl for years. she always was a sweet girl and one of the things i always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. her family life is stable as far as i know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200b;

but around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and i, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. when i'd overhear, i'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200b;

then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. i acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? it stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when i try to tell her to stop.

&#x200b;

so, to avoid anything else, i cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. but the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if i don't pick her up. so i pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where i was having trouble driving, and every time i stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200b;

the first time i got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. the second time, she didn't and it was bad. i was telling the truth, and even i thought i was a sleaze. i told her mother that i was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, i'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200b;

i really don't know what is going on here. i am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like i am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. i have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200b;

i am sure that something else is going to happen, and i just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200b;

**\*\*edit: for the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

i have known this girl for 10 years. she was less than three feet tall when i first met her. she has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. she has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. she is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

i want her to find true happiness in her life and i want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. the last thing i want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. i am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**so for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200b;

**2nd edit: a few questions answered**

1. my relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. she became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. she blamed me for her arrest and moved away. there has been no contact from her since she left. i have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. my friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. she has very little contact with her father. for example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. the mother is an immigrant from greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. i gave her a ride because i have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. when i was that age, i did not call my parents when i was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger i was in. i am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. my daughter's friend is not the only one i have given rides to.
4. my daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. when she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that i have to stay away from her.
5. it really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. but at this stage i have to.
6. i don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions i do, i am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

"i build my (26m) relationship on a lie and i dont know how to tell my gf (24f) or what to do  i met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, i commented on it as i broke the ice. we talked a bit and she turned out to love dogs and i just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and i wanted a date.

things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what i mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. i only really saw her dog when i was picking her up and i would never come in so i had no interaction with it.

thing is she moved out to her own place last week. she now wants to hang out at her place. i would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

i am really, really afraid of dogs. i know i should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. i mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? and then the more time passed the more embarassed i felt. especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and i just... how can i tell her i'm one of those people? except i'm afraid of all dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

how do i fix this? i don't want our relationship to end because i can't man up and just act like a normal person when i'm in a room with a friendly dog... i fucked up and i dont even know what to do here",8

so, we had the talk. my relationship is over. after some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late saturday, i brought it up. she again tried to deflect and change the subject, but i demanded we stay on topic. i told her outright how i felt, how i thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. she tried to play it off like i was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. then she spun it into a penis size issue. i kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her ex-bf and not the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. i told her i wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and i was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

the conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say i have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. i knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so i outright told her the relationship was over.

thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. they were helpful and confirmed my feelings. now i guess i will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. i'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

edit: thank you (again) for the overwhelming support. it would impossible to answer all of the messages i received.  i believe i made the right decision and will become a stronger person because of this. your kindness and support is truly appreciated.",8
"my(37m) wife(39f) just told me that she initially faked love when we were dating me only for the money and admitted to cheating on me. but she claims that she fell in love with me after we got married. i need some advice here. my wife and i have been married for 8 years and we dated for a long time before that. i own my family business ( fashion and jewellery ). we have 2 daughters.

first off, i'll be honest with you guys. i'm not an attractive person. i look average at best. i don't have a chiselled body, but i'm fit. my wife is really beautiful and i always wondered what she saw in me. i was bald at 19, so i hope you guys get the picture.

when i was in my twenties, i was very awkward and introverted. i didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. i met my wife in college. we had similar interests and i fell in love with her. i asked her out and she said yes. i was on cloud nine. and we never looked back. 

yesterday was our anniversary. we had a small celebratiion. when we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. i was really worried because i did not understand why. she hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. she ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. she also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. but she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. she told me that she really matured at that time and realised that i was the mist important person in her life. she also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. she told me because she really felt guilty. she told me that she would do everything to make it up. 

i was really devastated. i always kind of wondered what she saw in me. and i think i have my answer now. i'm broken. i also know that i only know this because she confessed. i don't know what to do and i need help moving past this. can you guys help me with some advice?

edit: thank you guys. i have decided that i'll do a paternity test and make my decision based on the outcome.

edit2: also, i've asked her to move out till the paternity tests are out.

edit3: though she fell in love with me now, i think i've fallen out of love now. i think i'm done with this relationship. thank you guys. i gotta work, so i won't be replying anymore. once again, thank you for listening to me.",8

i'm not sure if anyone will read this but it makes me happy to write about.  i'm really glad i posted my original question even though it made me sound like a dick. the comments helped me realize that i was the problem and i needed to get over myself. letting her slip away because of my judgmental ideas about people would have been a huge mistake. 

so i invited her over to my place last night and i awkwardly blurted out that i was falling in love with her and i see our relationship going somewhere. she laughed and and asked if i was asking her to go steady lol. she told me she felt the same way. then we got a pizza and some beer and binge watched a show. and i woke up this morning with her snuggled against me.  it was perfect. 

i'm in love with this woman guys. i feel like my heart is going to explode. she's the one.  i'm going to ask her to marry me one day. 

thanks everyone.",8
"my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me. my boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in hawaii with me and his two best friends (25m and 29f). we had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25m dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

for context, my boyfriend and i have been going out since november, and it's been serious. we had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and i agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

in early june, once 25m unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29f called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. she said that if i were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in costa rica.

i was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so i asked my boyfriend which week in august i should be setting aside for the hawaii trip. he let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if i were going, so he was going to go alone with her to costa rica. he said that we could go another week later maybe to mexico city or something.

i was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who i had never met before. we eventually decided to do a trip together to copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. i also asked to meet her, so that i could feel more comfortable with the trip.

we spent the 4th of july going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. my boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. i went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (i'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. they were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

this had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so i told my boyfriend that i still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that i was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. i had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and i asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

on a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which i asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. he said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. he kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and i didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

he asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. he bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and i drove the two of them to the airport.

i feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. i want to break up with him, but i don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

tl;dr - i (28f) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) and i can't get over it. i want advice on how to talk with him about this.

"just found out that my 25m fiancee 25f has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years 26f. hi all.

i've been together with hollie for three years and i proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. she's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen. we met on a night out. we moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. i thought hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now i'm not so sure. 

i'm best friends with a girl called sarah. we've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). i had a crush on sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

when i introduced hollie and sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever i'm around they've always been civil to each other. however, sarah has told me that hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. i never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

however, sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, hollie is actively cruel to her. making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. i did not believe this and actually distanced myself from sarah to protect my relationship with hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of sarah when i told her what sarah had accused her of. 

i've not been that close to sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. sarah was there and i brought hollie along. for some reason sarah left early and hollie was really upset about something. she started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

early in the morning when hollie was asleep i got a whatsapp voice message from sarah which was 20 minutes long. it was a conversation between sarah and hollie which must have been taken yesterday. it started off ok, but hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. she accused sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose sarah over her. hollie called sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (sarah is an elderly care assistant). she also told her that she'd make sure i'd want nothing to do with sarah. at this point sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. sarah then said goodbye to her and hollie can be heard shouting ''you f#cking b****!''

after listening to this i was not sure what to do so i pretneded everything was normal. i made hollie breakfast like i always do. she's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

i'm not sure what to do. i thought hollie was everything i'd ever wanted. she was perfect. but now i'm fairly sure that everything sarah has accused her of is true. the things she said to sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl i fell in love with. i haven't spoke to sarah yet, because i'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

i'm not sure if i can continue my relationship with hollie. sarah was my whole world once, and even now i still care deeply for her. to know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. but at the same time i was so sure that hollie was who i was meant to be with and i'm not sure i have it in me to break her heart. 

should i break up with hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to i go about building bridges with sarah?

"update i 34/m found condom wrappers in our trash can. my wife 34/f and i don't use them and i'm wondering how to approach this. link to previous thread here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

opinion on whether i should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  ultimately i decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  she wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that i could tell.  i know her pretty well and i think i can read her reactions to things well too.  and she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as i can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  i owe her the benefit of the doubt.  and finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and i'd figure out what was going on.

i brought it up pretty casually.  just ""hey, i found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  we discussed it pretty calmly.  she didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that i had thought of myself.  there was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  she understood why i was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

so that's pretty much the end of it i guess.  i don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and i'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  i'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all i can do.  sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for.",8
"i m32 matched with my wife f29 on tinder... big time throwaway account.

i'll start by saying that my wife and i don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

we met on tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. we've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, i would say.

a month ago she left on a business trip for a week and i found myself downloading tinder on a particularly lonely night. i don't even know why. i didn't have any intentions. but i did it.

i swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. it was a funny reminder of that time of my life. i deleted it and moved on.

on monday my wife left for another business trip. last night i once again downloaded tinder and started swiping. again, i had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

then i saw her picture come up.

i say shocked for a moment. i wondered if i should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. i thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... but i read her profile... it's her. it's her now and it's her live. there's even a picture of her where i am cut out.

i decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

i swiped and we matched.

she gets back from her business trip tomorrow. i'm going to confront her then. i don't even know how this is happening. she's over 100 miles. is a friend of her using her account??

now i have to explain why i was on tinder. this is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

what the hell do i do?

tl;dr - i matched with my current wife on tinder",8
"(update) my husband's m32 ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and i f30 want it to end right now. first, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. a lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



on the day i made my last post, my husband and i had a talk that night when i got home from work. i basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. he repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



then i moved onto finances. i asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". i pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. i asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. when i asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



i told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on march 1st. at this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. he wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as i talked. i doubt he even heard a word i said, but i clearly stated all the other issues i had -- the instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



after this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. for almost a week now he's slept in the basement. he basically doesn't leave the basement when i'm home unless it's to get food. honestly, it's pathetic.



i am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. i also have a coffee date planned for sunday with my best friend -- i am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. because honestly, this isn't the life i want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. i am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.



thanks again for reading and giving your input. ",8
"my (21m) girlfriend (22f) got into a wheelchair. don't know if we're compatible anymore. i know the title is horrible and everyone is going to call me an asshole but this is the truth. she got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. she's handling it like a champ. we've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person i know. always keeps her head up even after this. and i love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. but everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. recently i had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. honestly i didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all i cared for was my girlfriend. but we kept talking and i ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where i realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. one thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if i was my gf's caregiver. she has help that comes a few times a week, but i help her out whenever i can, though she doesn't always want me to. and if we stay together that's never going to change. i know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. there's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. i am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, i just don't really know what to write. i love her to the moon and back. but then i think, what kind of boyfriend am i if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. we were planning to get engaged next year. she's always so happy to see me and knows i've had issues dealing with the accident. she's so selfless it's not even funny. sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested i get a fwb so i don't get frustrated. but i don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, i don't want anybody else but her.

"not sure how to deal with my 37f anti-vaxx husband 35m since i want to get our kids vaccinated at first i assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  we were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

it's been 6 years. six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

first, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

at 1 year i pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and i decided to take her to the er.  

thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

he said all the things i've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. he explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

i tried to explain that i agree, but i feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes i was respecting up until now.

he ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

on the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

i look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

i won't do this anymore. although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

can i just take them myself?  we always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

what can i say so he won't go? how can i keep this form him, or should i tell him once it's done?

reddit i need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

please help

edit: for the people who are down voting::

if i was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. help me help my children this is no different. for those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. i thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",8

"i am 25 and getting married. dealing with issue around picking my ""maid of honor"" for my wedding. friends women in their 20s think my brother 35/m is a bad choice.   

i am planning my wedding to my awesome fiance and am so excited. we've been planning the event and will be married later in the year. he has his best man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. i thought i did, too. we each have 6 people and i have 5 female bridesmaids and a ""man of honor"" which i want to be my brother. my bridesmaids think this isn't a great idea and a few are hurt i'm not choosing them instead. here's why i want to choose my brother. 

my biological mother lost custody of me when i was 4 and i was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. i lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother's case. from 4 1/2ish to 6 i lived with my mother and it was bad. she was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 i was being adopted out. by some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and i went to live with them and was later adopted. the family had boys – the youngest was 16 when i got there. i was terrified of him when i got there, which they told me about recently (i have no recollection of that). i do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. he skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. i had eating problems, i had dental problems, i had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. he came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (i hadn't started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). he and my mom would do learning activities with me and by september i was okay to enter first grade. i used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he'd reward me with riesens. we were very close, he didn't go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. he'd pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 i had an older brother to rely on. he eventually moved out and went to medical school (he's such a great person for that field). 

very literally my brother helped save my life. i was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. he was a calm stable influence in my life. i credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – i would never have gone to college, i probably wouldn't have graduated high school or even lived as i was so sick. i had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before i was 8. my family doesn't look like me (i'm most likely mexican and something else, most probably african-american) and doesn't come from where i do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. since the others were older and out of the home i was never as close to them as i was my parents and brother. 

my thinking is, a maid of honor is someone really important and i cannot think of anyone else who comes close. i haven't even asked him yet but i think he'd do it. i told my parents and they said they wouldn't say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. my husband is also good with it and think it's a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified i suggested it and think it's ""creepy"". if i look back on that time, it's the happiest a person could be. is it weird and creepy? does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? is it highly inappropriate?",8
"my sister caused a scene at mother's day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom"" hi guys. i am a man, 32m and i have two sisters - carly (38f) and melinda (26f). we went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

melinda and i are happily married, each with three children. my older sister carly never married. she had a fiance that she cheated on and he left her. that was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. she has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

my mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and i both gave her an additional grandchild. so she gave a speech.

in her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""achem!""

she then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy mother's day?

i explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""i am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! just because i don't have human babies doesn't mean i'm not a f*cling mother too!""

my younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf i know right) and then stormed out.

we thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

we have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. i don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

i tried texting carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iphone so it's usually blue). does this mean she blocked me?

anyways i would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",8

i was really upset the day i dropped him off and he was texting me but i wasn't responding. i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, but i didn't want to do anything at all in the state i was in. i waited until the next day, and then i sent him a thought out text letting him know that i didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that i would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. he called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

the rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but i couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. on thursday, i think that he realized that i was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — i told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

when he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. i was working all day, but also i still didn't want to respond. he asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. the next day, i sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why i was throwing away everything that we built. he left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why i was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that i had made up about him to his face.

i wasn't going to respond to him and i wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. so i sat down to write him this letter. it's long, so skip over if you want. i tried to call him but i started crying and told him i'd just send him an email instead. this is what it said.

""the time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. i have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and i see that we should not be together. i am sorry that i have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

from the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who i had never met that either she goes or i go on this trip, and you picked her. you didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically i was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. that's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. however, i stayed.

this is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. here is what i understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. nothing happened. the other thing i understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. according to what i also understand, it took a long time for 29f's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after i'm not sure how long. this is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that i was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). you did not tell me this was happening until i asked when the trip to hawaii would be.

you purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which i have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which i repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. there is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. this makes me feel sick to my stomach.

so, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, i tell you that i want to meet this person. on my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. the first conversation that we have is one in which 29f and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. you tell me about conversations that 29f has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. i have a discussion in which i let you know that i see that and that it worries me. 

meanwhile, i am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. i, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. i want it to work out. but each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. it is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29m, we had only been together for nine months. how long did it take before 29f's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

we go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our airbnb for copenhagen, we go over it when i tell you that i still feel uncomfortable and i do not feel good about the trip. talk about repeatedly saying something! although i ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. surprisingly, i have no ideas either. 

ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29f will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. you attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. this is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. this upsets me. you do not know what to do. i don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. i don't know what to do either. there is no good solution that i can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. i tell you that either i have to get over it, or i have to break up with you, and that i don't want to break up with you. but my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

she arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. after all of this lead-up, i know that you can tell how unhappy i am. i fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy i am. you leave, and when i don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope i'm okay and you're going to bed. no call.

the rest of the week was rough. my text to you was met with, essentially, ""i'm sorry you feel this way."" you tell me that i'm being unfair.

there is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. this is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. this is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29f, i guess.

in the end, all of this is to say that i have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

there have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what i can only assume are personal differences.

i cannot handle your relationship with 29f. and i suppose i could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what i want to do. i want you to have your best friend, and i want to leave. i did love you, but i am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that i'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

it seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. i am not happy in this, and i do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

there is no need for this to be mutual. i do not need your permission to break up with you.""

he wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that i would not be able to handle their relationship.

he said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

i wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

he agreed and apologized. for me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and i don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. i stand by my decision at this point.

tldr: we broke up.",8
"i 32m make significantly more money than my new girlfriend 26f and it's causing problems hi everyone. long time lurker, first time poster. this may just be a problem i'm identifying in my head, and i know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

i'm an anesthesiologist in washington, d.c. and make over 300k a year. consequently, i live a comfortable life and, while i have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. i'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because i'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

my gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. she's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

we've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. i love spending time with her.

the issue is, i think she's uncomfortable with how much money i make. whenever i take her on a date, i insist on paying for everything. this makes perfect sense to me, because money i spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. but she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. she'll insist on splitting the bill, or if i pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. i've told her time and time again that i'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so i'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. but she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

one time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. it was nonrefundable and she was out $300. when she was complaining to me about it, i immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, but she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

it's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, i just think it's silly that she spends money on me when i make more in a year what she'll make in five. and like i said, i'm happy to treat her.

any thoughts on how to navigate this? i especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr i make a lot more money that gf, but she won't let me pay for things.",8
"update2: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her. 

update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.


i was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but i thought i should provide an update on some recent events from a mother from the pits of satan's rectum.

on saturday, i answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. they asked me if i was who i was, and i replied i was. they then said they were looking for my gf. i called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

the officers then split, one taking the gf to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

the officer who took me started asking me questions about how long gf had been here. if she had any contact with anyone else. if she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. i answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on gf. i asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

after a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. the moment they left, my gf told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if i had been hurting her. she was also asked if she was being held against her will. she said no to everything, of course. she said that the police received a call from her mother saying she might be in danger, and that i could be abusive her.

i was fucking livid. i immediately said i was going to press charges against her - for what? i dunno. harrassment probably?

my gf begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

wtf? she sent police to my house to get me arrested. how is that sane thinking? i could lose my job if i was arrested and charged. what the hell is she thinking?

i told gf that if the mother does anything like this again, i will definitely press charges. so the gf decides on sunday to talk to the mum to not do anything like this again.

they had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then i start hearing sobs. immediately, i walked into the room, saw my gf was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

i plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as i heard ""hello?"" from the phone. then i put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a mother"" and hung up.

then i held the gf for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

apparently, the mother was telling gf how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the mother again, or her brother, or her deceased father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat gf, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because gf would be going to damnation.

i told gf that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. i love her smile.

what do you think, if anything, should i do about the mother? no doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


response to some people from previous threads and pms after thread was locked:

1 - abortion was never an option. gf was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her mother. and if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - you can believe my gf cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, i suppose.  just fyi, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. cheating...right........

edit: 3 - my gf and i are still going to therapy about all of this.",8
"my 20f boyfriend 27m did something concerning during sex and i'm not sure if he just ""didn't know"", or if it was intentional... together for one year and we live together. otherwise happy and loving/respectful relationship. this post might be tmi but i don't feel comfortable seeking advice about this irl so i'm asking here how other people would feel about it.

so, we have a good sex life and i have felt happy and satisfied with it. i think he's generous in bed and cares about my own pleasure, i would not describe him as selfish and only caring about himself...until this incident. however, he's been asking me to try anal for a long time. i kept saying no and explaining my reasoning for it, which was that i was scared it would hurt and because it takes way more prep/care than piv sex. 

**here's the tmi part, i apologize**he had never tried it before. he's been fingering me back there during sex and i was okay with that, but a few days ago i was laying on my stomach during sex and he stuck it in my ass without warning or asking. i was a little drunk but knew it felt off and then it just really hurt. i told him it hurt and he said to try and relax. 

i did try to relax but it hurt really bad and i asked him like 3x to pull out before he finally did. at which point he apologized. but afterwards he did it again, and i asked him to stop again and he said to ""wait because he was about to finish"" so i allowed it to happen. i just waited til he came while in some pain and it honestly sucked.

 i'm not gonna say i was raped because i blame myself for the whole thing, but it was painful, not enjoyable, and he thinks it was great. there was no lube or anything so obviously it did not feel good for me. he wasn't rough about it but still wtf? how can you not understand that you can't just stick your dick raw into somebody's ass? it's not like a vagina which gets wet on it's own.**it makes me feel like he knew but didnt care.**

i just feel uncomfortable with the whole situation and i am not sure what to do about it. how should i have this conversation with him? what should i do about it? how would you react?",8
"is it weird that my gf (22f) ""tucks me in"" to bed every night? (21f) we've lived together for over a year now, we just had our two year anniversary, and she's the love of my life, i think she's absolutely brilliant in all sense of the word. 

our schedules are quite opposite, i wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. i always go to sleep first, i need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and i always have to be up early in the morning. she slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes i'm already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time i'm just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

i'm not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that i get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. i love it, i think it's adorable and i'm kind of a clingy girlfriend so i enjoy it a lot! i'm just wondering if anyone else does this?

recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and i went to bed early and left them to their netflix, and my girlfriend said she'd come tuck me in soon. i got embarrassed about it, like it's weird or something? i just don't want people to find it strange or gross, i don't know.

is it weird?",8
"my (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. is my life actually over? ok so i'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. my gf who i've known for basically forever (been official since i was 14) is having my baby. everyone especially my parents keep telling me i fucked up big and my life is over. they say i'm a loser and i'll never get anywhere in life. they say i'll never be happy again. how true is that?

i keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

i'm pretty much freaking out at this point. i have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. obviously i don't want to be a dad but im gonna be. so it is what it is. 

my parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. since i told them she was pregnant they said since i'm making adult decisions i now have adult responsibilities. they make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. i have to buy my own food and anything i need. i have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting i'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. i have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

i desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money i had none. i was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. gfs parents bought me a new pair since i got an infected toenail from being squished. i don't want to owe them too, jc.

anyway. i'm leaving home once school is done in june. gf's parents said i won't have to pay them rent as long as i help with the baby and contribute with that.

my parents say they'll sue me for the money i owe them. can they? when i get mad they just say i'm an adult and i get adult consequences now.

so ya. this got a bit derailed. am i doomed?",8
"my best friend stopped me from killing myself, but has no idea i have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. but a few days ago, i decided i was going to do it.

i was on my break at work (i'm a cleaner) and i just decided that i was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

i got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. but, then i got a text from my best friend.

she was just texting to ask how my day was going. she knows i suffer from depression and wanted to make sure i was ok. it's like she knew what i was going to do, even though she had no idea.

and just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. it's like it just melted away. i realised that i can't kill myself, because i know that she would blame herself. she's that kind of person.

she saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. i really want to thank her for it, but i'm kind of afraid to tell her because i don't want to upset her. i want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. how much i love her for it.

"should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg? pretty short and sweet. together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. he admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. this guy's pretty good! up until then i hadn't seen any. but i just spotted the giant one. i really didn't mean to, i haven't been trying to look for them. 

should i tell him so he can re-hide it? or do i take it tomorrow?

edit: i forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because i was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

edit update: he came to the room and i said ""what if i told you i found the giant egg?"". he laughed and told me ""well, i got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" i jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help i will."" 

i am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! will update then :)

mini update: doing my morning routine. so left for church with his family while i get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the reddit comments! one of the eggs was in my coffee pot. i guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! i'm so touched, honestly. it kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! will be back later once we're both home and i can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

update: firstly, a couple people i think asked so here are the eggs in question(http://imgur.com/a/lw1xoy3). the reese's thing is more of a basket, but i won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. on the shelf i could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's reese's for me in the ""egg"" xd. if you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; i took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) and ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. as for the last one, both of us swear i found it, but i must have dropped it somewhere? under the couch or something. idk. in the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

for everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. but, i mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way i've got it planned much better."". which isn't much news to me, as i've said we've discussed marriage at length (i even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). all i've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to do it.  i mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so i'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. searching for the eggs was very fun!! i needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg i needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand i was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

and no, i don't think i missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. i think i really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! i'll put slips of paper in each egg i hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things i love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) so, that's all folks. no proposal, but a very happy easter on both ends! thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. and to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; i've been there too. if you go through my posting history you'll actually find that so and i went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. it took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

tldr; boyfriend hid eggs. i found eggs. reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their so, easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",8
"updatei 59m cut two of my kids 24f28m out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. how should i fix this situation? **edit: guys, i understand how petulant my daughter is behaving, but please refrain from using profanities. she's still my daughter and i'd rather not read that stuff. you can criticise her behaviour without cussing :)**

**edit2: at the encouragement of some kind people here, i've booked flights to hong kong a few weeks from now. will be using up all my accumulated leave to take a trip across china. i've always wanted to visit the country and i am looking forward to this!**

-------------


original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

so i took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

before i even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. he seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

anyway, i invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. as i say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

i told them that i would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that i will only do so through a trust. that i'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after i'm gone. that them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. i'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as i say it **seemed** genuine. he also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if i helped pay, to which i agreed (i'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

my daughter did not take it well, christ. far worse than i expected. here i am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. i explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why i would leave it to them outright. nope, not good enough for her. she doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300k+ gbp on travel was justified. had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

so i told my daughter that as i'm retiring soon, perhaps i should experience the joys of travel also. perhaps i should spend ""her"" inheritance that i've worked for my entire life on travel myself. she stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

really proud of how my son's taken the news. extremely disappointed in my daughter.

genuinely considering spending ""her"" part of the inheritance on travel myself at this point.",8
"my aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother"" a few months ago my mother killed herself. i (22m) am her only son. my parents are divorced, and i had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that i was living in asia teaching english. i promised my mother that i would visit her when i returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before i came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. my mother told me i should visit my father first because of this.

i should also add, that at this time and the past few years, i was very, very depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. i really wanted to be at my home where i felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. when i got home, my grandfather passed away on the day i arrived, and i was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so i stayed with my father for a few weeks.

later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. i debated visiting her at that time, but i wasn't sure i would be feeling well enough to travel again. my grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but i told her i would have to think about if i can come then. eventually i decided that i would visit them at the same time as my mother.

the night i arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. that night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. i was driving home from the airport at that time. i remember that night so vividly as i could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  my aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. i noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. they seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

after about a week i returned to my father's home and stayed there. i was an emotional mess for the following month. i had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. eventually i began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" i was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. they accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. they even insulted my father. relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but i have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. i know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

today i received an email from my aunt that told me that i would have to go to court. it simply stated that i should call this lawyer. i am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. it's so difficult for me to think clearly, and i can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. any advice would be appreciated. i feel like i missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

&#x200b;

edit: i should clarify, that i don't know the actual legal accusation. she accused me of those horrible things while on the phone.

edit 2:  one comment mentioned it, but i just want to say that i don't believe they are after money. they genuinely believe i am a horrible person, and a horrible son, so they wish to hurt me.

edit 3: thank you for all the responses! i have read all of them, and they gave me a lot of confidence to keep moving forward. i did take the advice to post on r/legaladvice. so i'll update everyone (hopefully soon) to how this situation unfolds. thanks again!",8
"my wife (29f) is encouraging me (31m) to have an affair? wife and i have been married for 5 years. i think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. i think she thought the same. however, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while i was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

apparently ""fernando and sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! when he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what i'm getting from it.

so i told her flatly that i don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. case closed i thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

i'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear i'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! she keeps going on and on about her work friend fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

so at this point i'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? she's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but i'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" it's concerning.

straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""fernando's sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... i'm like... lost for words right now. how do i make it clear i don't want to ahve sex with someone else and i believe in monogamous relationships.

we have 2 kids.",8
"am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked? context. happened a few days ago. me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). we were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

after awhile his friend came back alone. my boyfriend got up which woke me up. i was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. my boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. i was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. i panicked and didn't know what to do. was i suppose to jump up and let them know i was listening? freak out? (i have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). i froze and he lifted up the covers i was under. edit: i was naked 

i confronted him the next day but he says i wanted him to see me because i didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and i should be too so we can let it go.

am i an asshole? can i not be upset because i didn't stop it?

update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. i've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. i thought i was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as i was making it since i wasn't touched or anything. i'd like to make an update after i talk with him again. when you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? im new to this.

to everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. i was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. i wasn't sure at first but i know i didn't do anything wrong. 

i'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. it's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

more info: i am hesitant to tell the friends wife because they have a baby together. i know she should know the kind of man he is but it makes me think of how i went through divorce but then again would he be a good father to the baby girl anyway?

"update 1 year later- i 28f gave my boyfriend 28m an engagement ultimatum and i might be regretting it original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: my boyfriend and i have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but i had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (i've known that i want to marry him for about 2 years, so i've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). i was getting frustrated, (i would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so i told him in september that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or i was going to move out.

&#x200b;

update #1 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. his asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in december 2018 if i visited his family in their home in september and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. his reasoning was that i had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (i had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). i was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200b;

now, on to the current update:

***march 2018***: i couldn't go through with the ultimatum. i was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. but when push came to shove, i couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. i decided that i loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that i had created. i also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in december. i felt i was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because i wouldn't wait another few months. as a compromise, he said we could get a cat (i had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. on 3/31, the day i was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200b;

***april-september 2018***: my boyfriend and i spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. we both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. i got a therapist and started working on myself. i picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. i think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. i'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. by the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. he also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200b;

***september 2018- visiting his family***: as i promised him, i went to visit his parents in their home in september. as i mentioned in the previous post, he is chinese-american (and i'm white), so i studied up on my basic chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. it was a great trip, and i genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. i left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). i asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in december would be ""too fast."" that seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. he also told me i needed to learn chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect english but prefer chinese when they are with family), so i started doing rosetta stone.

&#x200b;

***october-december 2018***: around november, i started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. he was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. for instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by december because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). another time, he freaked out that i have student loans (most people in my profession do, and i have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. luckily i already have this spreadsheet, which i showed him, and he calmed down.

in the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because i was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. i worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. i also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- i stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as i had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). we spent christmas together for the first time this year, and i really thought he would propose then. but he didn't, and i didn't bring it up or pout about it. he visited his family for new years and i was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200b;

***january 2019:*** i accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. i was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and i tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. i was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. it's now to the point that i equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that i shouldn't have. i realize i've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. but a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. first, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if i stay onboard long term. however, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (i am actually okay with it for the most part). he also has given a hard no to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). i started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

then, this weekend i went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. also, i want to have kids, that's the main reason i am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). so yesterday, i was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and i had this ""aha!"" moment where i realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. there's no shame in having my own wants. and at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (no marriage, we can't stay in the city where i have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but i've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with his desires. so i'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200b;

i'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. also i am willing to hear all the ""i told you so'"" from everyone who said i needed to leave this guy in march when i said i would. i totally deserve it. thanks for reading!

&#x200b;

***update***: wow, thank you reddit for the super thoughtful replies! i read each one (so far)! 

i spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. i started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. he brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. that we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that i want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes i make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. he worries about  the fact that i get a lot of amazon packages and he doesn't know what i am buying (showed him my amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). also this is all on my credit card (which i comfortably pay off each month) so i don't think i need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. he also doesn't like that i'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). also, since it came up a lot in the comments, i wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

however, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. i was pretty pissed and told him i wished he told me this a year ago so i could have moved on. he basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. so i told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. he's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but i'm remaining gently firm here.",8
"girlfriend (20f) and her friend (20f) 'tested' to see if i (20m) i would cheat. errr i really don't know how to feel. though i'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. my gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so i did. she wasn't there yet, but her friend was. we chatted for a while and she started being playful, but i brushed it off. playful turned into flirting and i felt super awkward. before i got up she kissed me and i left right after that and called my gf. i explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. i couldn't believe it tbh, i thought she was joking at first. first she was mad that i 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much i could do. and i don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? i've never heard of someone setting up their so and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

where do i go from here. she has apologized (half-assed that is) but i kinda don't want to speak to her right now. we're together for 6 months.",8
"my husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn't tell me. okay, this is not a shitpost. i wish it was. i'm deeply disturbed. 

the other night after sex, as my husband and i were getting up and dressed, i asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. he was on his way out of the room, and said sure. he wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. we weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

as i walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

i don't know what came over me, but i got this sixth sense, i don't know how else to describe it. maybe it was his shiteating grin, but i flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

he looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second i thought maybe i was being an idiot. 

he then says, how did you know?!?!

i was furious but it was such a strange situation so i just dumped it out and brushed it off. i didn't know what else to do. 

the next day i asked him about it, and i asked why he did it. he said, i don't know.  

i told him that it kind of made me upset, like i can't trust him to get me a glass of water. it hurt my feelings. he immediately got defensive. 

we got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. i said, so what? do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

he said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

i don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way i phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. but, like wtf?

i don't know what to think. 

am i overreacting?

edit:

for those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. he's 34, i'm 32. 

honestly i didn't expect for this to blow up. i wrote a quick post and went to bed.

thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, i'm trying to respond to as much as i can. 

here's my takeaway: 

some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

but here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. i asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. no harm done! that he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. he just did. 

so to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

after thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. to those asking, sure we just had sex and yes i suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. he violated boundaries and i feel upset about that.

update:

whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

i'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",8
"my husband (42 m) got his girlfriend (24 f) pregnant. i (38 f) have been sick for 8 years with cancer. you could say i lost my looks. so i understand why it happened. this is a new username because my daughter knows my other account.

before you are harsh about my husband's infidelity i should explain our situation. in the 8 years i've been sick we've had separate bedrooms and very occasional sex. i didn't know for sure he had a mistress but i assumed. my own parents had a similar marriage.

so today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. so it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. and just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). i tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that i can't lie to her. at that point i think my face turned white and i legit had no idea what to even do or say.

i was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows. i also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so i can't say someone ratted me out. she said that it was the way i looked at her. i never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and i know there's not even a chance. but now that i know she knows, what do i do? edit: update tmrw after i have a talk with her.",8
"should i (24m) leave my gf (24f) over her weight? hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and i love her to bits. she is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200b;

she has gained alot of weight and is now obese. i have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and i know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200b;

it doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, i have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. lets go for a run, same thing. have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. i  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, i found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. she also lies about what she eats.

&#x200b;

theres an excuse for everything. when i think of my future, i think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. when i think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because i dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200b;

you can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. when she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now i dont even recognise her. if you have any advice or comments i will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200b;

edit: i went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. im glad people understand where im coming from. i thought most people will be angry that i dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which i just have to say you are dillusional!.

i am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, i wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. i feel like the word therapist scares some people. also whenever i see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. alot of people mentioned sports too, i could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. i wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind i will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. if i dont see any improvment then i know there is no hope and will leave her. thanks again you lovely people, i will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200b;

another edit: i cannot reply to all your comments but i have read most of them! some of your stories have been great to read. a quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. she took it really well. to all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, i dont know because she would never tell me her weight. i really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but i shall know in a few months. i will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",8
"my roommate's(21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21 f) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them. tldr: my roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment 

backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. i was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. recently, my parents got me an apartment and pay  rent every month. so pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

over the past few months when we come home from class,  we have walked in on
1. her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. her mom cleaning my fucking closet and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. her mom and dad chillin at the apartment friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

i just can't deal anymore. i told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said i'm overreacting. am i overreacting? should i tell my parents?

i have lost my mind. literally. udhdudbdu helpppp.

edit 2: imma tell my parents about it. i just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

mini update: i took out edit 1 to shorten the post. i told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying i can put a lock on my bedroom door. me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. she doesn't look too happy. i'll update you all again when i tell my parents.

edit: sorry for all the edits but i think i need to clarify something. the reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. he said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

"i (30f) have just been diagnosed with an illness and am struggling to forgive my husband (39m) for not believing me. we have been together for 5 years, throughout those 5 years (and about 3 years before i met him) i have had numerous medical issues that i have had to deal with. nothing life threatening but certainly life affecting.

sporadically occurring symptoms have included chronic muscle and joint pain to the point i struggled to get out of bed, skin infections, serious fatigue, hair loss and frequent cold/flu like viruses. 

at first he was really understanding, would comfort me and sympathise with how doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong but for the last year and a half he has started suggesting it's in my head or i'm exaggerating the symptoms.  this hurt so badly because doctors for that last several years have basically said the same thing. i was prescribed pain killers, told i was 'just' depressed and given ad's, or just straight up dismissed. so i stopped bothering. 

then about two months ago i had to go get a script filled and she was so lovely that i started talking about some of this stuff. she ordered a bunch of tests and through intensive questioning and reviewing of my medical history i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. 

thankfully it's something that with appropriate medical care and treatment it can be managed and i'm now starting to feel better. my husband has profusely apologised and has been really supportive but i still feel hurt and kind of betrayed that he didn't believe that i knew there was something wrong. he saw the pain i was in but believed i was putting it on.

we've spoken about it but it still hurts, i don't know how to move on.",8
"update - my (21m) girlfriend (22f) got into a wheelchair. don't know if we're compatible anymore first off, wow. apparently my thread blew up after i went to sleep. i didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. i was  so embarrassed and mortified. she had already read the whole thing and my comments. i honestly didn't know what to say i could only say i was so sorry and that i didn't want her to find out like this. she was calm.. told me it was okay, said it touched her.. can't really describe how i felt. we just held each other for a very long time. might be weird but i knew i needed to be with her when she found out. i started thinking about a life without her, and i simply couldnt. i can't give up on this girl. we've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. i have apologized over and over.. she's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. a person this special i won't find again, but i hate myself for having thought about breaking up. she's still the same person. i should have communicated my feelings to her. i'm a very lucky guy. i really do love her to the moon and back. 

regarding therapy, i have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. y'all were right. can't hurt to give it a try, maybe i was unlucky with my former therapists. but i already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. and the girl who i talked to i've cut off completely. my gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. didn't realize she was into me. we're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. i was lost but i know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. i'm with her till the end. we're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. we're doing very well now. she knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. hope everyone here has a great day. thanks.

"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) really wants anal. i dont. here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnl77j/my_21_m_girlfriend_21_f_really_wants_anal_i_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

so, i tried it. i thought that maybe i was being too close minded and so i went for it. it went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. but here's the bad part.

she didnt like it at all. even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. this would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. she says that i sabotaged it because i didnt want to do it. but i didnt. i did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. she was really the director here. but somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

im pretty livid about this. i went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. and i feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. it feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes i ruined it on purpose. we had a fight over this and we broke up. thanks for the advice to those who participated in the last post.",8
"i (22 f) got left at the alter a week ago yesterday. now my ex fiance (26 m) wants to to apologize in person. he says he is gay and in love with his best friend. i had no clue whatsoever. 

he waited until our wedding day to leave me a note in my hotel room that contained this information. 

i am sad, angry, and confused. 

i wish he had told me long before the day of the ceremony and spared me the extreme pity and humiliation i went through that day. 

now he wants to meet in person to apologize and say goodbye. 

should i go?",8
"my (21f) boyfriend (22m) said he wouldn't want to date me if i had slept with as many people as him. i'm not to sure how this was brought up but last night we were laying in bed when he said that if i had had slept with as many people as him (roughly 30) then he wouldn't have wanted to date me. he also said that it's a turn off that i slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

he said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

i find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. i'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

edit: for those of you judging the amount of partner he has had in the past, your view is just as bad as his.

update/edit?: this really got a lot more attention then i was expecting and he has now also seen this post.  i really appreciate everyone's advice but i dont think am ready to make a rash decision just yet (much to the annoyance of most people on this thread). i've taken on bored some of the advice being said and think that i need to sit down and have proper conversations with him before i decide if i should continue this or not. i think i should hear him out when i have calmed down a bit and am less angry to give him a chance to explain his point of view.",8
"how do i (34m) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34f) that has no life skills? genders are actually reversed, he knows i've been browsing this sub lately and i'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

i'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. he has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. he never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. it's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. none of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

i feel like a bad person, but i don't see a future together that i want. i just wish i'd come to this realization sooner.

we have no kids, only 3 cats. we're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). only thing i can think of is he's on the bank account, but i doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. i'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... we've paid off about 40k of it. or technically, i have.

he's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and i worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. i still care very much for him, but i can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

how do i break up? i don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, i want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

update : i told him i wanted to break up. said this wasn't the life i wanted, and that i gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. i'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this thurs to work on any sticking points.

then left the house. he wants to know why now, why can't i give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. i had to leave, or i'm going to start saying things i regret or break down. not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so i won't be bored (what can i say, i'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

i'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. i lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

i didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. i had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, i'm going to leave it up. its not that i'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. i knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). i'll try to post other updates too. i appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. sorry if i don't have time to reply to everyone.

and if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, i'm sorry. i don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close i can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. i'd rather you didn't read this.

update #3 : he's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. no logistics have been discussed except it sounds like i won't see him for a bit. i've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. they all heard from him first, except his sister who i gave a heads up to (with no details). it's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. but i wouldn't have it any other way. i want these people to be there for him when i'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

i'm not sure i should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

i'm tired and think i can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as i sorted this all out. will try to respond to questions later.

update #4 : i really appreciate all the support, it's more than i can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when i need it. and i've needed a lot of it.

he's back and staying in a separate room for now. this is his home too, i'm not going to force him out the first night when i've already ruined his life. i planned to keep my distance, but i'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes i sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. he knows he fucked up. i'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him i want it done by the end of the month. if he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

also i'm seeing a lot of questions about if i'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man i needed. i don't know. i'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, i'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when i'm ready to go looking again. i know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. he's been my best friend for 16 years, and i still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. we grew up together and been through a lot. i don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and i changed. i'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and i'm the one that changed to realize i was not ok with it anymore too.

and to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. maybe for some it is, but that's not who i am. i want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. and is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. this has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. i want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone i have to fight and drag along.

thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. i'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. maybe i'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than i thought. i thought my tears would be done by now. the optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person i need. i miss and love him so much. but i've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. the support here keeps me going, i can't tell you all how much i appreciate it. it's going to be a rough few weeks, but i can do this.  i keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. i feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

the lack of support for me has been hard. only his mom has asked how i've been, and wanted my side. i think she understands. we were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. i knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. i'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. but i still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people i know. maybe i'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

he's i think out of the house for good now. not sure, but i told him either he goes, or i find a temp apartment this week. he left while i was sleeping and hasn't been back. i haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. he's a good guy, i wish i had said a better goodbye. given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. i know it's better this way, i can't be the one there for him now. it hurts, but i know it's for the best

update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and i didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. i consider that progress. some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. each time it happens, i try to identify the cause. usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt i've caused someone. it's hard not to miss him, but i feel a lightness about being free. and i'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. i'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. i have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

i've barely seen or talked to him since i broke it off. i don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. i said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it thursday. i really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. misses him so much, not eating much. she's 20lbs, and loves food. he stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that i just gave her. i try to show her extra love, but i can tell she misses him. and he probably misses her.

i've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. and writing in a private diary document. it's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. for example, if i start thinking maybe i could have tried another ultimatum, i can just go back and re-read what happened the first time i gave one. or if i get to feeling i could have tried harder, i can go back and read all the things i did try over the past year. writing it out and talking to others really does help.

"caught my girlfriend (24f) masturbating and she started crying my girlfriend and i have a good sense of humor, we like to play around and everything. so she caught me jerking off like a month ago, she thought it was hilarious and kept teasing me about it and asking me what i was thinking about and all that stuff. it's fine, it was embarrassing for 5 minutes but she wasn't mad or weirded out so that helped. i asked her if she masturbated and she said she never did and that she didn't need to and she didn't like it.

last week, i came home a bit early unexpectedly and she was in our bed giving herself an interesting massage. i heard her before i saw her so i came in and surprised her and i was teasing her a bit since she said she never did it and she just started crying and told me to leave. obviously i felt like shit and apologized but she still made me go. i came back home a couple hours later and she was still upset. to this day, she is still upset. i didn't mention it again, but she's acting different. she just seems sulky and withdrawn and not interested in sex. i don't know how to bring it up without making her cry again. i had no idea she was gonna react like that, she was making fun of me for weeks, i thought she could take a joke 

and i feel dumb for not knowing that she masturbated earlier on, we've been together for 4 years and i just found out. i guess she's really good at hiding secrets

edit: holy shit",8
"wife asking me to get circumcised - advice? hi guys!

my wife and i have been married 2 years, 4 together total.

i grew up in europe and circumcision is extremely rare there. apparently it is much more common in the us.

all her past bf were circumcised and she says she prefers it that way.

she stopped giving my oral sex once we got married and she says it's because she doesn't like doing it for me because of how i am not snipped.

she also calls it anteater penis and makes increasingly disgusted faces when we have sex.

i am willing to do this in order to make her happy but i just want to know you're all thoughts about this.

tl;dr: wife doesn't like my ""anteater"" dick as she calls it so she wants me to get circumcised.

"i'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up my husband and i have been married for 5 years. we have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. it's no secret that i am cranky when i am tired, and especially when i'm awakened from sleeping. we joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

last night, i went to bed at 10. he stayed up, which was fine. he even took the baby downstairs with him so i could get some better quality rest. all good. 

just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (baby sleeps in our room.) i don't remember any of this, but he says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. baby started crying. i got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" and went back to sleep. 

this morning i woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. i noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. feeling very well rested, i told my husband i felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. he said yes. i asked why, and he told me i yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

i remembered none of this. once he told me the details, i have a vague recollection of what happened. 

i feel really guilty about this.  simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. how do i change this behavior?

edit: thank you all so much for all the posts and advice. when hubby got home, i gave him a big hug and told him i was really sorry.  i told him i really wanted to work on it, and read the list of ideas that you guys helped me generate; thank you so much. we had dinner, i put the older two to bed; he took the baby. after the boys were down, i planned to continue the convo (and see where the one-on-one time leads us), but he is sound asleep with the baby!  i'm going to let him get that much-needed rest. will do some research online and see what kind of help there is available for me. thanks again.",8
"i m26 recently found out my ""step-father"" m48 who just married my mother 2 years ago is currently having a sexual relationship with my wife of 4 years f28 behind my back and has been since late summer or maybe even before that. what am i supposed to do? should i tell my mother? i'm sorry if this is a little much. i've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

my wife and i have been married for 4 years. we argue sometimes over little things but i love her with all my heart. there's never been anything wrong until now. i thought we were happy, i always treated her right and got listened to her. i took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. she doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so i gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because i wanted her to be great. she goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

i'm not close to my mother at all but i see her from time to time. recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. she was horrible to me growing up but i tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. she has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. she recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him x. my mother invites me and my wife and it's the first time they all meet. probably 4th time i've met him since they married fairly quickly. he seemed.. okay. just really didn't like his vibe too much. but i gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

last year, x asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. my wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, i agreed. i thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. x and my wife really hit it off and i'm not very good with construction/renovation related things i ended up going out with my mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. it was weird but we tried. my wife stayed behind and helped x remodel. her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than i about how to help fix the house up.  they seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when i wasn't around and super animated conversations but i didn't think much of it because i assumed she was just being nice to my new ""step father."" i trusted my wife. 

she started going back over to my mother's house to help x out afterwards. they live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. i noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. she kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since i wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. it was like once or twice a week. this started happening early this year. when the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which i didn't mind. i guess that makes me stupid. when her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. she seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. i tried to go with her to my mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and i didn't really like x's humor/mannerisms. i didn't mind, i worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

a few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. i always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. she was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. it does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. i didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. i tapped her screen to see what it was and i recognized the number. it was x's. he sent multiple mms messages with his face and nude pics of himself. there were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. just alot of words i haven't processed yet. i took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know i saw. i really wish i didn't. i really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. there are months of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, i took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the midwest. he's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. she doesn't know i'm leaving in jan which is when our lease is up. i told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. i came back and she didn't seem any different. our anniversary is the day before christmas eve.  i haven't told my mother, not sure how or if i want to. i haven't told anyone except you, reddit. i want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

it's been a while but i still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. i feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. i already feel broken and empty. i left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. i thought she was happy. we have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time i found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. i need some time to think and i need to know how to fix this with my wife? how do i tell my mother? i love my wife with everything she's all i have i gave her everything these last 4+ years. i cant just  divorce, im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

i know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but i don't have anyone else to talk to. i was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but i don't think i can lay next to her anymore. i've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. i'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. she's already called me 3 times and i'm just exhausted emotionally. it hurts ignoring her calls. i'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if i have the time. im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but i hope you have advice. 

tldr my wife is having a sexual relationship with my mother's new husband and i want to know how to stop it and fix my marriage somehow",8
"(update) i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

it all came to a head last night.  she just came out and asked me if i did not love her anymore and all that i could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

this started a larger conversation that i won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that i would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that i would have felt like i could have worked on it.  i would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  but to know that i was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something i thought i could get over any time soon or if i ever could for that matter.

i was even honest and said that if it was just a ons she had or some random guy who was just huge i might be able to get past that.  but knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when i met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than i could handle.

she kept trying to tell me how much better i was at everything else and that i should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  i told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes i needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that i can never be.

i tried my best to be gentle, i tried to take all of the blame of stating that i knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who i am.  

btw i'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

this is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  i am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  everybody's christmas is ruined.  we had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

this alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am i going to say is the reason why we are not together?  she didn't cheat and if i say that i felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  it's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

in the end i feel like a massive failure.  i feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and i feel like a failure because i wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

she has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially i said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  we can talk about every single thing and i can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who i wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what i do i will never be as good as her ex.  i just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

but because she legitimately seems heartbroken i agreed to go.  but that does  not mean i will keep going.  

today i moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until i can get a place for myself.  she has been with her sister all day.  

i feel like shit.  

thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  i honestly have tried to read everything even if i didn't reply to very many.

the bitch of all of this is that i still love her.  there is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

edit:  well once again i posted this and then went away for awhile.  i went with my friend to see mortal engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so i started reading awhile ago.  it is going to take me forever to read and once again i don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  but thank all of you for reading and responding.

edit 2:  i guess i do want to share one thing i spoke with her about.  when we were having our very long conversation i presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  i know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  so i put the scenario to her like this.  i said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend tim and you heard this.  ""jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way tiffany did""  ""but its not jill's fault tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person i've ever known and jill just isn't as smart"".  then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""i love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""nobody makes a sandwich like you do and i think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
at first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   she ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  i then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw i would never say to anyone out loud about anyone i loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
edit 3:  if anyone even reads this i want to add one last thing.  people have been telling me what a whiny bitch i am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because i can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  not going to lie and say i'm thrilled with it but i'm not dumb enough to think i have a giant magic wand or anything.  i had grown up believing what i now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  but even with that ultimately i might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  but hearing that no matter what i did, how much i loved her or any other thing that i was never going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if i hadn't heard that i would never be the lover i think i might have been okay.  well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  yes i overvalue sex.  i get that.  yes it is very important to me and well frankly i want to be wanted as much as i want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  yes i know whoever i date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  but i would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later.

"update: i (27m) just learned my wife (27f) lied about her past, including being sexually assaulted by my best friend. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i\_27m\_just\_learned\_my\_wife\_27f\_lied\_about\_her/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i_27m_just_learned_my_wife_27f_lied_about_her/)

&#x200b;

wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  as expected i received a ton of different opinions, and i thank you all.  however some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  it helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200b;

i had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that i had found and that bothered me.   
 i told her i just wanted the truth, and that i wasn't angry.  she explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that f took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  she was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  she was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  when f finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  she had told f to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  she also pointed out that once f left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  they went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  there were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with f was available).

&#x200b;

i know some of you wanted me to talk to f.  but i have no desire to, and i definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  there was plenty of texts from f to w lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  he lied to her saying i was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told w countless times she never had a chance with me.  w had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200b;

my wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion i'm sticking by her side.  we discussed our other relationship issues too.  like i said, we had been struggling recently.  but the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  she told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  she was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  she wasn't mad that i looked through her messages, she even said i'm welcome to look.  but she promised she has nothing to hide.  whether you agree or disagree with me, i married this woman for a reason.  and while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, i believe we are on the right path.

"my girlfriend won't sleep with me because she's afraid to get pregnant.. to clarify, i don't mean sex, when i say ""sleep with me"", i literally mean she won't lay in the same bed as me because she's afraid to get pregnant. we are both 18 in college and, tonight, she was spending the night in my dorm after watching ""a quiet place"". we both laid down and she was adamant that her or i sleep on the floor. so, i slept on the floor, and she still put her pants on because ""oh your semen can end up in there"". this is the same girl that was worried after we made out (in full clothing) that she was pregnant. this is so frustrating and i've had to have the birds and the bees talk with her and she's still pulling this shit. i tried laying in the bed and she started complaining and now, somehow, we are both on the floor, mad. what do i do?",8
"muslim guy 22m whom i 22f multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity we have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

during the first year of uni, he has asked me out and i declined. during the years, i have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. i guess, in total, i had to decline him about 10 times or so.

however, during last summer i had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how i am). we have talked a little, and that's all. soon after i had stumbled upon him near my house. i confronted him again, he denied following me. after that i told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

it all has been silent until last month. two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if i have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. she didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. he did not reply.

today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

i lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. he denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. i have ranted and once again blocked him.

however, i do not believe this is the end. i am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. i mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

he never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

&#x200b;

what am i to do?

update 10/07: i would like to thank everyone for your replies. a lot of helpful advice was given, i really appreciate it. the situation doesn't seem so unmanageable as before.

also, to those wondering why am i 22 after 6 years of university - well, that's how educational system in russia works, my friends.

thank you and stay safe, everyone!",8
"every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new xmas decorations she just throws away after new years. she promised me last year was the last but i just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. i'm disgusted. what do i do here? (both 34, two kids) wife and i have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. i've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during xmas. 

i don't mind her being generous to friends and family. it brings her joy and i appreciate that. but what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of christmas decorations. everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

to best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. she will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. then she'll see one at walmart which features lighting mcqueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. so we'll have 10 new stockings for xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on january 2nd. the rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. replace stockings with any other xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about april on her xmas purchases. i told her enough was enough and frankly i'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. we went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. she agreed.

however i was getting ready for work (i work extra saturday shifts in novmeber and december to afford the holidays, another post i guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new xmas decorations hidden in the garage. i would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. i'm so disgusted i can hardly see straight. 

i'm up at 4:30 on a saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. i feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

what do i do here? sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here. 


edit: my meter is a little off but this asshole is trying to troll me right?

let's see... her problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. hey! you live there too. you get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for your friends and your family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? you bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. but you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. hey, i've got an idea, mr. man. get on your tiny snowflake feet and put the fucking decorations away. then there they are, next year. her? she's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle.",8
"update: my 34m wife 28f wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend original post(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bev4g9/my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby_after_her/)

hi all!

wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than i expected. first of all, i want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. it means a lot.

now, onto the update.

for easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a bbq at her sister's. not wanting her family to see any tension, i saw this as a chance for her to have to speak to me. as we're getting ready for church, i tell her that we need to talk about everything now. she agreed and sat down with me.

i did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). she agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

also, i know a lot of you suggested that i get a paternity test. i know that i'm 100% the father. i didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. i thought it out, but, i still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. she adamantly said no. she had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. she tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. she described him as not being a good person at all.

she apologized for making me feel that way.

i told her that i understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. but, i had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

she started to get choked up and was shaking. i told her that she could tell me. 

she confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

she also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. she wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. she talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. she actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. she doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. she feels gutted. 

regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. we're the best things that has ever happened to her.

anxiety also runs in my wife's family. my wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. it's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

after discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  she has her first appointment this week.

tldr: wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. she keeps thinking about how he died. wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. she's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. wife will go into therapy this week.",8
"i (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood. i don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where i'm from, so i'll be kinda vague.

&#x200b;

i live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. it wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. it's home. now that i'm at a huge university in my city, i've met people from all types of backgrounds. of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. he's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. but i was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. we really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200b;

in my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/gpa. that applies from elementary school and until the end of college. college kids who provide id also get a crazy discount. finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. the good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

it's like, in my hood hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. i think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. it's super lowkey.

i took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. he never seemed scared or judgemental. when we walked in, i was getting out my school id. i explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. he laughed. i asked him what was so funny.

he said ""they shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". i asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

he says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. that getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. i told him that is where i live. it's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

this started a huge argument.

i asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. i have 3. they were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. it's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. my mom goes to a new funeral every week. some of the kids i grew up with are in jail right now. my mom still hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. he said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. that there's ""nothing impressive about not being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". and that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". that this is why people get dependant on welfare.

at this point i told him i was done. i didn't want to debate, i didn't want to talk him. not then, not ever again. we just went out separate ways. i broke up with him as soon as i got home.

he thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. that we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. i told him, yes the fuck we are. he's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  i think i may have overreacted with the block, but i want him to leave me alone. i don't want to work it out.

all my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

i'm not saying i have to be with someone who's from my hood. but i have to be with someone who at least gets it. especially when ""it"" has shaped who i am today. idk what kind of person i am, but i think i might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. that ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

edit: i'm sorry i wasn't clear. should i let him reach out to me? i don't want to get back together, but should i unblock him and talk it out. i'm worried that i'll fold and we might get back together. i've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. i'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **i didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. but our core values don't align. what he said and did disgusted me. in the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

edit: guys i did not make it out the hood at 19, i still live there lmao. i'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day i can get my whole family out.

"my boyfriend choked me we went to a concert last night. and had some drinks. his mood turned toward the end of the evening and seemed grumpy. i kept asking why he was mad at me and he wouldn't tell me. he kept calling me a bitch and pulled my hair while i was walking in front of him to the car. on the way home he wouldn't say one word to me. when we got inside his apartment i said ""please talk to me. why are you made at me? i'm sorry. please don't be angry."" he just snapped and pushed me to the couch and started choking me. i was so shocked. he stared right in my eyes while he did it. i couldn't think of what to do so i slapped him. i just wanted him to let me breathe. then he slapped me back and started choking me again. i didn't pass out but my vision was going black. he got off me and left the room. i grabbed my stuff and ran, going to my house. the next day he didn't apologize he said ""i didn't want to hurt you but you were acting up last night. i love you, but you brought that side out of me."" ....... i don't know what i should do?! i'm so confused. he has never done this before. maybe he was just really drunk.

first of all, i would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so i am very grateful. 

i have received some pretty messed up private messages, and i wanted to let you guys know because i don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: date rapist here: hey i just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. i knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(i can provide screenshots if necessary) 

as for how it unfolded: i gave my boyfriend my phone to text s if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. he made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that i was very upset about what had happened, that i needed an explanation and that i was telling my bf everything. his answer was ""how could you not know i have always liked you? i thought you liked me too."" ""i am sorry i went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. he then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, i saw you put something in it."" he then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

my boyfriend called him and told him that i had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. he also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. i don't know what is going to come of that. 

honestly, i just don't want to see him again now. the police has my report and i hope he never tries that again but i can't do much more. 

thank you again for the support.",8
"forced to quit diet so my gf(31) and me (38) started a keto diet 7 weeks ago. we're both obese. it did work for me, lost 30 pounds since april 1st, feeling good and with energy, no more anxiety and started walking now i'm running on a daily basis.
but it is not working for her. she has lost only a few pounds, looks the same and is hungry all the time. problem is she is so frustrated that wants to quit, but also told me it was unfair and is trying to force me to quit too. i tried to tell her it was unfair too and selfish, but she just got more angry. this is working for me, i've been obese for 20 years and i feel now like never before. i don't want to break up but she is been irrational. what should i do? thanks in advance.

edit- i never expected this level of reaction and the amount of advise you're all giving me. thank you! i'll talk to her, you people have given me great ideas for what to do next. i do understand there are more issues behind her attitude, i will be more supportive of her but will continue exercising. thank you, thank you all.",8
"i 17/m glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend 17/f going though all her messages, and i saw hearts and ""i love you"" to her best guy friend. is it normal, or am i just overanalyzing things. she text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. here's the kicker though. he calls her cutie. he's told me in person that he's interested in her. he calls her cutie over text. now, obviously i can't just outright tell her anything, because then she'll know i caught a glance. she said i love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so i guess it's normal. i'm just trying to get some other opinions.

edit one: wow, thanks everyone, seriously. i talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. she was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. i told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. she agreed with me, i think. i told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""i love you"" thing. she has some extracurriculars, so i won't hear from her until around 4:45. thanks everyone, so much. i'll let you all know what went down.

edit two: nothing yet from her, but i'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. if i don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

edit three: so, being 17, i have a momma to talk to. so, that's exactly what i did. i went driving with her, i've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and i both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. however, come monday, i will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. obviously, i won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. thank you all for the continual support, i love you all.

edit four: alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. he called me, and apologized. he didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. he said ""it may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. the girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. thank you all, even the ""you're 17 shut up fag"" comments. i love you all unconditionally. night y'all.",8
"my wife (f30) told me that she cheated on me (m28) and i honestly don't know what to do we have been married for over 5 and a half years. i love her so much. we finally got our own place on december 2018 and things were looking up for us. these 5 years were so magical and i always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that i would marry her again.

this past tuesday, my lead told us that we can vto  (volunteer time off. i work night shift) so my co worker gave me a ride home. (my wife and i share a car). when he dropped me off, i noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. i thought that she parked somewhere else.

as soon as i went inside, i went to our bedroom so that i can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that i am home. the plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

she wasn't in the room. she wasn't home. so i called her and asked her where she was. when she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

my heart broke because i had a feeling of what was going on. she made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

so i was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. she sat on the bed and i asked her if she was okay. she wouldn't answer and began to cry. then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. she said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

i am sad. i honestly thought this would never happen to me. i don't know what to do. we had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. we agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, i am strongly considering in divorcing her. i can't even look at her anymore. the thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. she wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

what should i do? am i overreacting?  i honestly thought of killing myself. i am so sad. she was my everything.

tldr;   wife confessed to cheating. i am so sad. thinking of killing myself.  what do i do?

&#x200b;

thank you

&#x200b;

edit to say: just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) i am so surprised for the support! <3

thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. i still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  i forgive her. time will heal this pain and honestly, i love her too much to end this.  we have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. i honestly can't imagine being with another person.  she is truly sorry that she cheated on me. most wont agree with this, but i will give her another chance and see where this goes.

and no, i wont kill myself. i promise.  i really appreciate your concerns and replies. it makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. take care everyone and i'll update as time goes on.. <3

\*\*\*update 09/13:\*\*\*

i have been reading the comments. i understand that to most it is stupid that i am still with her. i understand. trust me. we have been talking a lot. she is truly sorry and i forgive her. i put her mistake behind me and i am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  we plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. the reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (we will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200b;

we are working this out. we are still living together. we are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. honestly, it has been going well. things are looking up because soon, i will be transferring to day shift so that i can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that i have been longing for. i still want her in my life and i don't see divorce. we will work this out.

again, thank you all for helping me in my time of need. i am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. it helps. ill update as time goes on. <3",8
"am i being a prick? basically my so (26f) is unemployed and has begun spending £80 a week renting a horse. her total income is about £130 a week in benefits including child maintenance and we obviously have bills to pay for and rent. i didn't think it was really an option to spend that much money so she could see a horse from time to time but she feels it's completely justified. she's quick to criticise my choice to go out for some drinks maybe once every month or two and i do work full time. for the sake of peace i've told her i'm happy with her decision as long as she can continue contributing towards rent (£35 a week for her) but she's really pissed off that i insisted she explain how she's going to be able to afford it. what do you think, was i an asshole to question her choice?",8
"update family left me (18m) when they thought i wasn't my dad's son but now they want to get back in touch starts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family\_left\_me\_18m\_when\_they\_thought\_i\_wasnt\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family_left_me_18m_when_they_thought_i_wasnt_my/)

&#x200b;

tldr: dad thought i wasnt his kid and left me. now, it turns out i am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. but it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so i dont really want to be his pal. family says i'll regret not giving him a chance, and i came to the internet for perspective.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice, but i decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and i'll be standing my ground.

i've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying i'm a crazy teen and i'll regret it. but grandpa made a point that i need to stop trying to decide how i'll feel in the future. cause truth is you can never know. you have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. not based on feelings and info you might have later.

right now, i´m disgusted by dad and brother. i want nothing to do with them. i don't trust them. and i even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

if my feelings change, i will deal with that when they do. cross the bridge when i get to it and all.

i wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause i don't see the point. my story is kindda over.

but something happened yesterday and i wanted to share.

so i decided to stand by my ""fuck no, i don't wanna talk to them"". i'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, i asked him not to share and i know he wont. he is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. he called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

so mom showed up at his place (i've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can decide whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. looool so mom goes insane, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, i'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". it goes on for a while until mom says i'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. he looks at me and says i'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

i was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, i broke. mom left after a while and i just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, i'm your family, family doesn't leave. you remember that when you have one of your own"", and i fucking will.

&#x200b;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. i'm good. grandpa is the shit.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit - o, before i forget. some people were asking about what my siblings were like. well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships i had with friends, family, even a girlfriend i cared about). he was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. i guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, i'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200b;

another edit - i read the comment section to grandpa, i had to explain what og is and he now wants to watch breaking bad and better call saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. but he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". the comment comparing him to clint eastwood made his day! thanks for the love guys",8
"my husband has sex with me while i sleep wth? ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while i'm asleep. i know it sounds crazy! im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. on a few occasions i've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows i'm waking up, he stops. i am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. i hate sleeping in clothes, i'm a naked sleeper but i don't think that is an open invitation right?

 last weekend, i woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until i acted like i was still asleep, i wanted to see how far this was going to go.  i pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime i ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until i fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and i said.... was that good for you? he tried to act like he was asleep!!! i told him i was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. his answer...i was horny, it wont happen again. 

fast forward a week...i haven't been talking to him all week. i go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. i confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, i'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if i did that to him and when i asked why he stopped when i woke up he says because he knew i'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. i am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. i'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe i could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

at this point in feel like i can't trust  him anymore and i don't know what to do. has anyone else ever dealt with this? do you think i should believe him? he is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though i've told him i've caught him before.

"was i(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" first, some back story. sorry, little bit of a long one. my wife(24f) and i(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, i learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. she told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so i wouldn't notice. she was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. i completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and i hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. she thinks they're very unattractive. well, not on every guy. she likes beards on certain actors. but definitely not on me. so i have stayed clean shaven for her. if i even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. she'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until i do shave. progressively getting worse until i do the deed. but it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. i'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. if i could, i'd probably try to grow it out and see how i look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. comfortable. these whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. after a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (i have average length hair). now, i love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, i want that to be clear. but these whiskers: i'm not a fan of them. they're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

she gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. after a month of her not taking care of her issue, i finally said in the most loving way i could ""hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" she got quite offended. but, she took care of the problem. a few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. i make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. it gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. i make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that i love her, and don't much care how she looks, but i'm not a fan of them. which again, she was offended, but took care of it. now i'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, i suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then i have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. always getting pissed off that i dare say something. it's at the point where if i don't say anything, she won't do it.

a few days ago. she was ripping me a new one because i wanted to have sex, but i haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since i was ""too scruffy."" it's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. i snap and say ""this is bullshit, i shave almost every day for you. to look my best for you. but you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though i've kindly told you i don't like them."" and i finish with ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. we're okay now. i've shaved since then. she has not.

was i wrong to have said this? was i wrong to look at this as a double standard? should i have approached this differently?

* update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. we have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. she seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" i haven't tried to bring it up since.
* update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. in this case, both. she says she doesn't like how i look with a beard. i've never had a beard while i've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, i do not know. hell, i don't even know what i look like with a legit beard. earlier in the relationship, if i had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" which frankly, i understand. but then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* update 3: pcos. yes, she has it. she's known she's had it for a long time. i believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. the hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. up until recently.
* update 4: everyone recommending i should post this in /r/amitheasshole. no can do. that sub has a 3000 character limit. my post far exceeds that. feel free to tell me if i'm the asshole here if you like.
* update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. i will definitely mention these to her. when the time is right of course. i appreciate you folks.
* update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*i'll shave when you do.*"" that works for me. i'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* update 7: ""*you shared this story with your guy friends!? you're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? lol. i actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. i only shared this argument with two of my very close friends. and i only mentioned the bits about her getting on me about shaving my own beard. not the personal bits about her. not that i need to defend myself, but there you go.

"update my(27f) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31m). everyone thinks i should break up with him but i don't want to. what do i do? original post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cohppg/my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m_everyone/)

turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. they said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and i will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and i will no longer love him. i reassured him and made sure he understood i will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. boyfriend and i agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. so that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, i feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. i've been told ""i told you so"" by my brother..

i have been putting off talking to his grandparents. but i will definitely talk to them before i let my son spend time with them again. i want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). i think i will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. wasn't expecting it. i know many of you think that i should cut his grandparents off but i honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. maybe he misunderstood. i will find out for sure when i speak to them. i am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes.",8
"my(39m) daughter (17f) wants me to sleep in her room because she broke up but i suspect something mire to it. edit: the title should be more to it not mire.

i know this is actually a really weird situation. i'm sorry i do my best to raise her but i know that i can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. when i asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. she told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

i just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. she didn't want to talk today either. i think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. what do i do?

update:  hey guys i sincerely thank everyone here for showing their support and giving me some much needed advice. i just wanted to update this. so, my sister came over and took her out so they can have some alone time together. it turns out that she broke up with her boyfriend because he's been cheating on her. now he's just being and idiot and bombing her with messages and calls. she just blocked him. but he's basically threatening her with ""consequences"" for breaking up with him.

"update: boyfriend's (21m) best friend (20f) hates me (25f) and wants us to break up. first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3eda8/_/

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

"just found out my girlfriend 26f of 6 years was cheating on me while i'm 30m spending the holidays with her and her family. my girlfriend and i have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. things have been fine until five months ago when i found out she was using a subscription dating app. i was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. i believed her because i know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. after we got back together, i felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and i often felt neglected by her. she would spend a lot of time texting even when we are facetiming at night. she told me she texting her girl friends and i believed her. i went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. but i noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. she also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in march, but dodged questions when i asked for details of the guy. finally, i've had it and looked through her fb messages, and i found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. i confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. but upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state i am going to graduate school in). she told me that they only kissed that night. i asked her to show me her texts and fb messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. i found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so i wouldn't be suspicious. she also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her ex. she was apologetic when i confronted her and i made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. she reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

i feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. she's my first girlfriend and i love her so much. her family treats me like another son. but the logical side of me knows that i cannot trust her anymore. i have to stay with her until saturday and i don't know what to do. 

tl;dr long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and fb for months even during the holidays when i'm visiting her. she met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

update:
thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. maybe i'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. we talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. it was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). she pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. we both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. she feels ashamed of what she did. i will still stay until saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. but we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. thank you everybody for your input.

"a tinder experiment with my 28m girlfriend 27f of 3 years has gone horribly wrong. hi all. 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. i met her irl, but before that i was having no success with the tinder game. she, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200b;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on tinder, and i laughed with her and added ""tinder's way worse for guys, though"". she didn't believe me when i told her most guys get 0 matches, and i wouldn't either. so we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. and the obvious happened: after one week, i had pretty much no matches except bots. on the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what i judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). she admitted i was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". we agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
the problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. i sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. when i asked if the tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""i don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200b;

i feel like i've played myself here. is this doomed or is there any way i can save it? 

&#x200b;

tl ; dr: played a tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

"my 36m wife 34f has been having an affair with her own brother and i realised our son might not even be mine. i dont know how or where to begin. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

my wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). new people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

my brother in law lives very close to us. he is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. my own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. this is something i never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. it wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that i got suspicious. apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth i dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. that is just...disgusting to me. tonight i did something which i never done or felt the need to do before, and i checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. but after having scrolled through a ton of messages i find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. i am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

having sit here now thinking about what to do i cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. so many times have i heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

i am really at a loss at this point, i have no doubts about what she has done, but i cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

i feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

i want to divorce her, but i dont know how to go on about finding out whether i am the father or not, i really dont know what to do if i found out my son wasnt mine.

​

edit: after reading several comments i decided it is best to not confront her now. my wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and i just told her i am not feeling well. i can barely look her in the eyes at this point. the only reason i am keeping it together is for my son. i wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so i will sit infront of the tv and sleep on the couch.

​

edit 2: had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. i wont be reading more pm's, i have gotten way too many of them.

currently staying with my sister, i decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so i just told her i will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. my sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. i have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. we scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why i will get it via a court.

i will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something i will ever accept or can forgive. it's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. to the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

i will confront her but i cant tell when, probably tomorrow. my sister wants to come with me, but i wont let her, i will head over there by myself and let her know what i found out, will see where it goes from there...

"i think my (22f) boyfriend (25m) mostly likes me because of my race. i've been seeing this guy for about 5 months. everything has been going really well so far.

i'm half japanese/korean and half white. for reference, i've been told by multiple people, including him, that i look like kiko mizuhara. (although i don't agree, i love the compliment btw)

so i've known since the beginning that he loves japanese culture. no biggie, whatever. i've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
somehow my mom got brought up and how i'm more japanese than korean. he got weirdly excited. it kind of weirded me out, but i let it go.

then he said that i ""shouldn't call myself white"" because i'm hapa. that pissed me off, but i didn't make a big deal out of it. then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and i was so grossed out.
it escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that i felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. he got angry because he said i called him a nazi. (i did not. i said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault i have yellow fever"" and ""japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

i'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but i'm pretty sure i'm done with him. i've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. all of our friends are white, and i'm afraid they'll think i'm overreacting or something. idk. i guess i'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay. 
thanks

edit:
thank you everyone who responded. it really means a lot to me. to clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. i have decided to completely end things. i'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. the friends i have spoken to totally agree with me. i feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. so yeah, thank you all again. you all made this so much easier for me. i'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

edit 2: again, i just want to thank you all! i've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. my friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. honestly, i'm not super sad about it anymore. i feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. and to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. i really wish it were too.

edit 3: wow! i really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. again, thank you all. i'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. i just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

edit 4: i just realized someone gave me gold n silver! tbh, i don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! i'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. i can't thank you all enough. i wish i could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

edit 5: hey you guys. just wanna give out another thank you. i wish i could read through everything, but i don't think i'll be able to! just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when i said weeaboo, i mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- i've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like kiko..."" i didn't say i did. i said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. i don't necessary think i look like her, but i do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe i will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. reading through all of these comments, i'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- i'm talking about our mutual friends. i met a couple of them through him. not all of my friends are white, and i knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. i didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but i would never be able to see him the same way. the damage was done.

thank you all again.

edit 6:
okay, one more thing. i don't only date white dudes. race has nothing to do with who i'm attracted to.. seriously. i never said i only date white guys. he just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. the area that i currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. i do not have ""white fever"", and i should not have expected this.

please stop messaging me asking how tight i am. i will block you.",8
"update i (29m) showed up to my gf's (25f) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am. update to original post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. i obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that i initially did not end the relationship. (what a regret).

how i handled it was we met the next morning to talk and i let her explain her side of things. she explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. i explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. so in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

i was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but i did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

we had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. there were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. i did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts i made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. this was getting old but i was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. the deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'you're the love of my life, i love you more than anything, future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. these were all exploited to be absolute lies.

fast forward to a few nights ago. we had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. i let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding i then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. she did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. i let her know, 'hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' it makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. she ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of ok we will just talk later. i call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, i had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

she calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. i ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... i know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you i was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. i keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. she then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that i cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. she tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

meanwhile, i knew i had friends going out that night as well and i could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. i did not tell her i was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 am rolls around and im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. i walk down the street and lo and behold there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. one of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. shocker, i know. i confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and no accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. i turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because i'm sure i was irate. i have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. i walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. she shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. i tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. she says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. even though i'm pretty hurt at this point i cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. i tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and i truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. i left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

i do want to say though, i made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. so many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. and it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing i have ever had done to me. listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. if you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, i ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way i cared for them. who knows how much longer i would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but i am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. much love.

&#x200b;

tldr; attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. felt i was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. caught her on a date with another guy. broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

edit: i really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback i've gotten here. as well as all the insightful messages i've received. i am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. thank you

edit 2: for the people responding thinking i was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. i did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",8
"i (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex..... ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. we have been married for 11 years in august. 

i love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. and it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

i constantly tell her how beautiful she is, i tell her how much she means to me, and i try my best to do whatever i can to lay signals that im into her. i hug her, i stand close to her in public, i make it well known that im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

she reciprocates none of it. she never comes on to me unless i straight up ask her to (seriously, ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. i work long hours, and ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. she gets upset if i cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and i came on top of her pussy). she keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. it fucking sucks. the sexiness factor is zero. i love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and im not sure i can do it anymore. its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

anywho, it came to head tonight. i asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. she said yes. so the time comes, she was on me and i wasn't totally into it, so i started to get soft. i made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as i had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so i didn't ask). so she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. i lost it. i said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. this is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and im fucking done with it. she has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

i cant live like this. there is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. this was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

tldr: i am married to my roommate who i occasionally have sugar free vanilla sex with.",8
"update: is a picnic basket too much on a first date? original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blwo1p/is_a_picnic_basket_too_much_on_a_first_date/

update: the date went really really well! nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. the drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of oregon and was super scenic. we only saw two other cars. when we got to the falls we were the only people. chinook salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. the bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. i kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. i think i did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. we stayed until it almost got dark. 


i did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this indian casino. she said she had never gambled in her life so i brought her in and we had a drink and i gave her 20$ to spend. she found this bee slot machine (my last name has honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! at that point it was getting pretty late so i walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. i am going to see her this weekend again. definitely stoked!",8

thank you everyone who supported me throughout this. i think im over it and it's just a thing that happened i guess. 

edit 2: people, i am gonna make an update in a few days when there's enough news to bring home. 

edit: hey everyone. thank you all so much for the wonderful comments. i've been packing for the past 2 hours to go to my mom's, thankfully he still hasn't come back. if he ran away, its wishful thinking on his end. i talked to my dad, who is an ex-cop, and he knows some people that would help with my situation. 

i honestly cant believe what he did to me, even till now. it was so impulsive of him, he was never like this. regardless, im too disgusted by the thought of him right now. i consider myself to be a resilient person and can brush this off (the experience, not the problem itself), its just that im still shocked by what happened, and the fact that it did. ill reply to some of you as soon as im settled at my mom's.

i just wanna mention that i got a message from someone on here telling me that i should've expected it?? disappointed when i read that.

&#x200b;

original post:

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 months. we're currently living together (for the past 2 months, edited this part due to people misunderstanding), and we're an admittedly kinky couple, so ""abuse"" is part of our sex routine. we are always safe about what we do, and have a safe word and everything.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn't wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear ""wanna try anal?"" but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said ""sure, just make it quick."" he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn't listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (""b******n"") 5 times and he didn't respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the er and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn't healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven't seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don't know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this.",8

"update my (21m) friend (21f) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man. **previous post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my\_21m\_friend\_21f\_is\_being\_forced\_to\_marry\_a\_43/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceqcnx/my_21m_friend_21f_is_being_forced_to_marry_a_43/)

first of all i want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. your comments gave me further insight in this situation. i apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as i was busy with work.

so after my last post i talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21f). we explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( i know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. she is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). after lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. but she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14f) who would still be with her parents. so we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. so we convinced her to take her sister with her. we also involved her sister in our plan.

now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. which was managed by our professor *( dr m. i will not give his full name here. but dr sir i know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, i thank you million times. ).* apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

so on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. we made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. after we had breakfast at one of my friends place. we all left for the train. we made sure she destroys her old sim card. skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and i helped her unpack. bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. we still need to take admission to school for her sister (fortunately there are free schools for girls in india). and she recently landed a good job. so financially she is settled, but i will still be helping her however she needs.

meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. we also informed women's welfare center about this. things seem normal and i will keep you guys updated as things progress.

"my m20 girlfriend f19 of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. i am completely broken. i need some support. update: my brother decided to end his life.. hi, i would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. i just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

if you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

as you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. i am his older brother, i am 23 years old while he was 20. that day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (i live in another city), and he decided to stay. we had a long talk, and i was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. he also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. he lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. i was trying my best. until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from university so he could focus on healing himself. 

two days ago i was at work, and he was at home, as always. when i came back i saw something that i hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. he hanged himself. it hurts me saying that. it was rather unexpected. even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, i never thought he would actually do that. about a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when i asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.he thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. even you guys. he said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad i love them. i can't keep up with this anymore. i am sorry. i love you"".

i tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. i don't blame him. losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. i am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. we were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. it really sucks to say the least. i soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

i felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. i want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. you guys are amazing.

thanks once again.

p.s: a few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. if you think that's the case then it's ok. i am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful. 

as for the rest of you, thank you people for the nice words.",8
"i think my (31/m) girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me and stole my money. we have been dating for around 2 years now.

friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. it's a place her and i don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. she never came home saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

there is no reason either of them would lie to me, i've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. both super nice people.

i confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". i went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. all of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because i don't believe her and i think she was cheating. worse though, she took my fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck. her name isn't on my bank account thankfully but it looks like she's trying to clean me out, how would i proceed?",8
"my (19f) boyfriend (22m) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat i've been dating this guy for about a year now. it's not a long time, i know, but i felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we've been known each other our whole lives or something. i sound so stupid, i know. i just really trusted and loved him. a lot. i trusted him with my life. a year cmon 

i went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she's so hot, you're so lucky etc so i was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of me that my boyfriend secretly took while i was giving him a blowjob. i am pretty conservative, my parents don't even know that i'm not a virgin, and i have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows i do not do pictures because i don't want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. i remember him on his phone, i asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. i never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

i feel so disgusted i can't even describe the feeling in my stomach like i want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. all these pictures and videos he'd taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when i'm not looking at him. i just feel so fucking gross. and who sends that to their friends??? that's so weird!!! you're sending videos of you having sex to your ""bros"", that is so fucking weird. and the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

i cannot even believe he would do this to me. i was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said i was invading his fucking privacy. seriously??? your privacy feels invaded right now??? you clueless asshole. i just started yelling at him and honestly i'm not proud of it but i started hitting him and grabbed his towel. he was acting like i was overreacting and he started hitting me back. are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. he started saying some bullshit how his friends think i'm so hot and they just compliment me and it's nothing bad. and you're not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew i was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. he wasn't even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think i'm so hot  

what kind of a betrayal. i wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. i have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and i just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. i feel so fucking exposed like i saw those videos, i had no idea what was going on, in my head i was thinking about how much i love him and how happy i was and look at what this bitch was doing 

and he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he'll stop doing it. and he said he was really hurt that i'd take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he'd be waiting for my apology. he is so fucking clueless i don't even know what to say",8

i was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. they never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. when my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when i was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. when i was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. we got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. we never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. today i'm 19 and rose is 34, i still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so i come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200b;

so a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a dna test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. after the results came in i found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% ashkenazi jew) i found out later that i had an aunt\33f\ in the system. i immediately reached out to her(let's call her jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. all that without telling rose a thing.

when we met up i could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. we tried to figure things out so i asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. they never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

i connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. when i saw the picture, i knew. this was rose, 100%.

rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

i immediately gave jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

i went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now i'm sleeping over at his place. i told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to rose much.

i can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her i know the truth.

what the hell am i supposed to do? how should i handle this? should i tell her i know?

&#x200b;

edit: my best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). i thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. i have decided to break it to rose this week but i need some time to think about how to tell her i know.i don't know if i should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. i even considered bringing her sister with me but i genuinely think she will be pissed. i'll keep updating as soon as i'll decide how to tell her. right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200b;

edit 2: after seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, i decided i need to explain some things. first of all it's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. we were in foster care that time and rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. at that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. at least that what i was told. i don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

"i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, i did not. t/l/d/r

i (33 f) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 m) and i are indian. he thinks i've cheated, meanwhile i'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

a little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

we've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. so when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

i'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. at first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

i can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! he stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and i'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think i'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

i haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? i'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like i'm drowning.

update: i'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. i had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

i've decided i'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. i'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me. 

many asking for updates, i'll try and come back when the test does. ",8
"my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish... update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/beskkf/update_my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

we've been together for 3 months and i had no idea that she held those beliefs. she's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. this is completely out of character and i'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. she sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. when she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass jew"". i was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. she said that all jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

for the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. neither of us are religious (she's middle eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


she continued saying that you can't trust jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". i asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


i still haven't told her that i'm jewish, i'm not even sure how she will react when i do tell her. should i even bother? it sucks because she's an amazing girl and i'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. any advice? 

**tl;dr my girlfriend went on an anti semitic rant and explained how much she hates jews. i'm jewish, should i tell her and see how she responds or just move on?**",8
"it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce. happy update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


title may seem harsh so i apologize. also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

bit of background info about my wife: she's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. so to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

to make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. for the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch netflix in bed. i brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least i could do.

but now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching netflix in bed all day. i ask her every day if she needs anything but all i get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. i do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. i've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. therapy. she said that all therapists spew bs back at you.
2. adoption or using a surrogate. she shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. moving to her parents' city. she said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). she snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. again, she said that's too much stress.

earlier tonight i had a talk with my wife. i told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. she said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

don't get me wrong, i love my wife with all my heart. i'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. i know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly i cannot bear living like this for much longer. what do (or can) i do?",8
"32m my wife 33f will not shut up, and i'm not sure i can take it that much longer. is it possible for that to be a reason to leave? i'm not sure if i should have posted this on instead.  but here goes: my wife will not shut up.  i'm not talking about your usual chatty cathy.  i mean she (almost) literally will not. shut. up.  she will talk continuously from the moment she knows i am within earshot.  not just in the same room.  i mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that i can hear her.  she will not *stop* talking until i'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  on more than one occasion, i've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before i went in.  she also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  so i get to hear all the bathroom noises on top of whatever homeric epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
i once drove from tampa, fl to chicago, il with her (before we were married- i'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  she did not stop talking the entire way.  the entire way.  
  
television on to a show i like?  pfft.  that's not a problem.  she'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  having sex?  that's the perfect time to tell me about how olivia newton john still has the leather pants she wore in grease and she- brace yourself- still fits in them!  really!  needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  ever.  i've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
i get it.  she grew up in a huge italian catholic family in the bronx.  if you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  i, on the other hand, grew up in a scandinavian family with two children.  to this day, i'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  i actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  i was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  she never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her i'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
that's not true, though.  another difference between people of swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  other than the minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  no ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  a nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  i think it has a lot to with living in the frigid north.  you keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
to her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  she's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did i just say?""  i've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  she'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and i'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if i had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  and she'll say ""yeah!"" and think i've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
i joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  and you talked loud so they didn't finish.  my son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  it got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  i didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now i know why josh has a stutter.""  just like that.  
  
she's failed at least one job interview because of this.  i know because i lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  he called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
we rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  she monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  who wants more than one does of that?  
  
you're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  yes.  many times.  sometimes jokingly.  sometimes with utter seriousness.  the reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person i know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  the one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
i try not to let it get to me.  she's a very affectionate woman.  loves me to death.  mother of my child.  pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  we still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but i'm pretty busy so i don't really notice as much).  but it *does* get to me.  it's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  there's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
i know the answer to the problem: i have to ""talk back.""  in effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  i would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  i would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  i would have to learn to use italian hand gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  but i'm not italian.  i'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  i'm not sure i can take it that much longer.  i'm just not sure if i could get a word in to tell the judge why i'm there in his divorce court.  my wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: wife will not shut up.  is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
edit: obligatory reddit ""omg i had no idea this would blow up.""  which is true.  i thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  but rip, inbox.  it was nice to know ya.  so in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, i will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions i saw popping up multiple times.  
  
also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
q1 - is this bs? (implied)  
a1 - no, it's all mostly true.  i admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  the bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  not from sexy times, anyway.  she probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
q2 - why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was op's wife hot?)  
a2 - yes, she is hot.  and funny.  and vivacious.  also, i really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/sarah_dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  and if i'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a lot of things don't seem all that terrible.  damn you, penis!  this is all your fault!  
  
q3 - did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
a3 - medically speaking, i cannot state this with 100% certainty.  the cause was never formally diagnosed.  however, i watched it happen first hand.  i'm not a qualified speech therapist, but i think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations i made.  i'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  which leads to:  
  
q4 - aren't *you* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  after all, you did nothing to stop it.  
a4 - guilty.  and i feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  for the record, i did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  but i think by the time i realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  and anything i could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  all the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  if there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and i'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
q5 - is it because she's (pick one: ocd, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
a5 - i don't think so, although i've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  i see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
q6 - have you tried counseling?  
a6 - no.  probably should have, but i know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  it's bizarre that i can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, i've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  and yet, i'm seriously considering divorce.  i realize the contradiction there.

"update: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving i will be posting the update here instead since i am still receiving pms to update what happened. i am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me i am not allowed to post an update thread there) so i got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. this is the post i posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. will try my best to update it as time goes.

here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

click here to see my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

i will try to be as detailed as possible. i have had quite a few pm's regarding what happened and i got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. i want to let you all know that the support i have received has been incredible (both in pm and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

i am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the pm's, theres just too many to respond to but i would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

i would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, i tried to respond but i noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but i still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. much love to you all.

i basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. i cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that i found out before i got married, with no children or attachments. i still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, i guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, i honestly dont know and dont care.

when i was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after i left reddit, she had woken up. she noticed the drinks out and asked me what i had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. i followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, i didnt want to give her any hint of what i knew. she asked my why i had been drinking and why i didnt come to sleep last night and i told her i was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. i felt detached, like i was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

she asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". she got herself done and left for work.

i basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. i planned on leaving things like furniture, tv and other things i really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. i just took the stuff most important to me so that i dont have to return here again. i dont care if she gets the rest. all in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

i called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and i really dont care at this point.

i also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

around 1 pm i called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. i didnt leave any note or pictures at home, i just left. i am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 i start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

the only person i called back was my dad and mom. i have a huge trust for my parents, i basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. i told them its ended, and that i wont be getting married no more. i also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what i told them, i trust them alot so i am sure they wont say anything. i didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that i found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. i just told my dad not to intervene and that i need some alone time now.

i basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

i dont know if i should respond to them now or wait some more? her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). i am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

once again, thank you to everyone who replied. i will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, i know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. i hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

time here is 10 pm soon.

tl;dr found out my fiance cheated and i left without saying anything. not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

edit 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

edit 2: thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. i will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. i might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. i honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",8
"my gf is dirty as hell and i can't stand it so my gf (22f) is one of my biggest blessings in life, but man is this girl dirty as hell. when we first initially met she had told me, but i was like naw can't be that bad... boy was i wrong. 

just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. let's talk dirty:

the kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. dishes will pile up. trash gets full. unless i clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc i can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. i have talked to her before about how i shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. she be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. half the time i do her laundry and i have to ask her to fold it. if i don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. she will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for days. things start to cultivate! 

honestly, i have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. i explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. whenever i bring it up she gets annoyed. she will clean the day after i mention it and then never do it again until i bring it up again. ugh. advice, suggestions?


edit: wow this really blew up! i just wanted a little advice so that i could hear different perspectives. some of you provided great advice so i appreciate that! will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",8
"update am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked? edit: his friend messaged me and said i had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. i haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

when my boyfriend got home i told him we had to talk, he agreed. i was going to tell him how messed up this was and i am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

turns out i don't need to tell her because he already did. she was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so i won't know where that side is going.

he apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. we had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think i minded, but now understands i didn't agree. he said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when i confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. he was completely remorseful and i even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. he said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. this is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and i have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""i just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

even so, he went to his parents for now. we had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but i don't really know anyone. i'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. we always hung out and had great times. only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. he did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. he wanted to pay for me to go back to school. he believed in me and supported me when i started my writing. he helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. all the nights he stayed up with me while i cried.

i wish this never happened 

i don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. i definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. he says he'll give me all the time i need and if i can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

to all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and i should be happy he wanted to show me off; i hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

edit: just to add about the drinking. we had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. going as far as insulting me. we talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. we just drink with friends now so i definitely think that is a big part of it. this was a couple years ago. it also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. but this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

i also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so i know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

"my (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated i won't talk to her exactly what the title says. my coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because i was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( i took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why i'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but i'm coming and going 'as i please'.


me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that i had a miscarriage. her response? 'i told you you were pregnant! why the hell are you here? you need to be home! this is why you had the miscarriage! you don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. what is wrong with you? you are being so stupid! you don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. come on, really. who do you think you're telling this to? i'm a woman! i have gone through things like this! don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. honestly, take care of yourself. '


and then with that she announced she was going on break and i sobbed in the bathroom. i pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but i've moved desks. i'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. today she tried to send me a birthday gift and i refused. she is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. she also tried to coordinate breaks with me. i, of course, insisted that i break at a different time. 

this is making her frustrated and i am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why i no longer want to engage socially with her. i am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. how do i explain to her i don't want to be friends with her anymore? is there a way i can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

tldr: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why i didn't get in trouble, i explained that i miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that i shouldn't be surprised if i can't get pregnant again. now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset i didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

update: first, thanks for the support. i didn't expect this to blow up like it did. yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


second, she ended up submitting a false report saying i interrupted her work day and withheld important information. it is false. i have witnesses, i was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. i will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier.",8
"dumped before valentine's day so.... it's 11:09pm on february 13th. less than an hour until valentine's day. and my boyfriend of 7 years, who i had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. no explanation, nothing. then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. needless to say, i'm super confused and completely devastated. how am i supposed to survive valentine's day? it's always been our day. we've always done something big and extravagant because valentine's day is our anniversary. and i just feel crushed. some people have suggested i have a girls night, but i don't have really any friends that live near me. and i really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. any advice?

edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and i have a 2 year old son together. so it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

edit 2: a lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. i'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. and we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by january 1st. it was such short notice, and right at christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. he lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. so he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

edit 3: my son was only in this post so people could understand that i'm not just being a whiny bitch because i got dumped. i'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. and please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. that was my decision, not yours. oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. we got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and i weren't around. we live in ny where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. so i'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted.",8
"my 29m girlfriend 24f tried to throw me under the bus when the police searched my house first i'd like to start with some background. my girlfriend and i have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. she stays at my house about 75% of the time. we have had no major problems before this point.

on saturday night, we were watching tv in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. my immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, i found that it was the police.

at this point i was extremely confused. i don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. i have no firearms in the house. i do nothing illegal online; i don't even pirate game of thrones. i had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a saturday night.

i opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. i asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. in turn, i refused to give them permission. my girlfriend repeatedly said i should cooperate. i said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. they then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what i thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

the first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and i into separate rooms and begin questioning us. i kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local pd is backwater and shitty enough. 

i refused to answer any questions. i told them i wanted a lawyer if i was under arrest. i repeated that i did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you breaking bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

my girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. i didn't hear much because she was in the next room but i overheard her say this:

>you should check the back yard shed! i've never been in there before and i can't say what's in it...

at the time i could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, i'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. at that point i asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

i don't need legal advice. my mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. she's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. i'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""i panicked and didn't know what to do."" what i need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their s/o under the bus like that.

does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

"fiance wanted an open marriage, so i called off the wedding. people are asking questions. should i let them know why? &#x200b;

for those that keep messaging me for an update, it was posted long ago, and it can be found **here**(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99y261/update_fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called/).

&#x200b;

\-----

&#x200b;

two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

she asks me to go to therapy with her. she was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. that sounded a little weird to me, i thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. i have never met her therapist. so to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

the day comes, and i go there. but out of self preservation, i had my phone opened and recording any audio.

my fiance was already there. i had to wait 20 minutes before i was invited in. the therapist greets me and shakes my hand. we have small talk. she tells me i am not at all the way my fiance described me. i think she is trying to compliment me. then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

that absolutely weirded me out. but i am a calm and collected individual, and i don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

so the therapist starts talking. has a small speech i don't care to repeat. my fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

i smile, i am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind i am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. modern woman and girl power and all that.

nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

the other non-traditional type of marriage. i forgot it's 2018.

but she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

because she would be too heart broken knowing that i find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

so i let them finish talking. they were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because i wasn't saying anything. this was definitely something they have rehearsed.

i then asked the therapist if she is licensed. this, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. she said yes. so i told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

i wished them good luck, and left the office.

now, i want to report the therapist. i am not sure if i have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? i don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and i want her to pay for the misconduct. that ""session"" did not sit well with me.

to be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where i could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. that's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

it also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. now that i have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

so i was a fool anyway.

i listened to the recording, and i still can't believe what was said there.

anyway, i called off the wedding.

i am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because i am not seeking them. there are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. that might have given my ex the impression i will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. having listened to the recording a few times, i am confident the therapist recognized i am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions i am not comfortable answering.

how do i navigate this sea?

i am sure my ex is doing damage control, but i have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, i will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

but my parents and family also want answers, and i am not sure what bs to tell them. i don't want them to think i am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

she is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""we can work on this"", ""i didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

last cry of a dying siren. all her cries fall on deaf ears, and i am the owner of said ears.

we were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but i cancelled everything.

i basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. i had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once i figure out where to do it, and what to say.

this post is mostly a rant, but i would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. my ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and i don't want to be a he said / she said. i do have the recording, and am wondering if i should send it to the interested parties.

my ex doesn't know i have the recording.",8
"i (21f) had sex with a guy i met on tinder last night (25m). to me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me i took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. what in the hell do i do? i guess some background is in order, i met this guy on tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on wednesday and agreed to meet again on saturday. i did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

so last night we had a great time. we ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. the sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again i had no idea he wasn't into it. so after finishing i was just telling him hat i really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

at first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. i was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what i had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that i knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. i told him that i was really sorry but i saw it differently. he ended up getting dressed and ran out. he was crying so loud and so intently i could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

he drove away and i haven't heard anything from him at all. i am so lost as to what to do. 

1. should i call him and apologize? even though i feel i didn't do anything wrong?

2. should i call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. should i just swayze him and say i've dodged a bullet?

4. should i actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


thank you so much for the help!! i'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy i met on tinder. i'm lost as to what to do next?
 

edit as of 840 az time: he just called me. he was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. i said i wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. he kept trying to goad me into talking and i asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. something tells me i stepped in a huge pile of shit. my dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

well if i become the first female #metoo you saw it here first. 

edit2: you pathetic little mgtows and mra incels can stop saying ""if the genders were reversed"" or see this as some sort of ""get em guys"" cause celeb. it's been said already. morons.


so awesome this post is bringing out the best of everyone in private…

"update i feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout. we didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on saturday. i wanted to speak about things in person.

i didn't want to go in all accusatory so i just started to say how i feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). i talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

how ""cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. just a source of entertainment and that upset me. they let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. there is always a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. it's like a show. i thought it was a coincidence until i knew it was kinda...orchestrated? black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. i told him that i didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. but i talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. he listened to me the entire time without jumping in and i've never had someone do that before so i appreciated it.

he spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. that's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. but never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. he sees things differently than i do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. but you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. then we talked about why we were with each other and i won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

then we started talking about the ""drip or drown"" for guys and **""if she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

we both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. he was frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. but the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. at the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. it's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

his dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. it offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. plus, they're just fun to be in.

so everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

also people got so mad because i called myself pretty. women are told to accept compliments all the time, but i do it...it makes me conceited? i'm hella pretty and i know it. stay mad.

but to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**edit: guys i read the comments and i'm more confused...i really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. he listened to me and i thought all i could do is wait until i see if he follows up. he seemed genuine and i do give him the benefit of the doubt. but maybe i shouldn't...idk here.**

**i've never dated outside my race and i have mostly black friends, so i've never been in this position before. i came here to get different opinions and i did. i guess what i'll do now is watch closely. i really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**",8
"(update to) i 32m was going to propose to my girlfriend 30f until she told me she's pregnant i was thinking i'd edit the original post, but i decided i'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. since the original post really blew up i don't think too many people would see an edit, so i'm making a new post instead.

i took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the obgyn visit. the iud was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. however, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. it's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. i ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. we sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. eventually the sun began to set and i decided it was time. i started to say i had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. she told me she understood so i skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. she said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. after we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (i knew she used reddit but i didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. she said she would have preferred i proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, i am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. we're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. we're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

these past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. thanks for helping me get over my worries.

edit 2: marriage license -> certificate.",8

i showed up to the house while he was at work. (i have a key and my mom was there so this wasn't an issue.) when he got home a few hours later he nearly crashed into my car out of excitement. 

we said hello. i asked him if he liked my shirt. he kind of confusedly said yes. i told him i got him one too, he laughed and got up to grab it. i unfolded it so he could see what it said and he just about stopped breathing. then he took it and went into the kitchen, pretty clearly because he didn't want us to see him cry.

i took the advice in the comments and confronted him in front of his family by making a „joke"". at first there was silence till his brother made up a fake laughter to calm the situation as you literally could feel the tension. my husband just gave me a poisonous look and didn't say anything. later at home it became a huge fight were he hold a speech about his „role as man"", „his proud"" and that i were unable to be a „good ,caring wife who supports her husband"".
as i didn't shut up this time he told me to fuck off. i took a few things of mine and went to my parents'. i can't believe that he changed to this person as i met him as a open minded man. and i can't believe we were trying to have a baby together. i'm glad i could opened my eyes before it went that far. i'm going to divorce. my parents are thinking that it's a temporary situation but i don't wanna risk a life in abuse and handcuffs.

the same thing happened a second time the day after i posted that, so i went along with the suggestion of filming myself while i sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever i napped during the day/evening.

&#x200b;

long story short it clearly is my brother, i've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. i have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if i should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

edit: i didnt expect so much advice! i'm going to read everything. and for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. so i'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

2nd edit: i want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. some very calm sounding people have suggested i speak to my brother before anything else, so i'm going to do that. i know some others have warned not to do this, but i think its important to speak to him first. if it goes badly with him then i can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if i speak to them first i can't undo it.

so, i have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  we kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  what we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  while ordering, oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is astounded, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  youngest son says he can fix that and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""wtf is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  she is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, i take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits perfectly on her finger, and she has quite literally had enough!  she finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until my oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and i place the next size on the table.  at this point she's just staring at all of us, and i explain what had happened, and how i was able to find the jeweler, etc.  i even showed her the reddit post.  she didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

she (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have killed me if i had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

so, about the jeweler.  they responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  the oldest son is making jewelry and doing repairs only to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  they sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  i followed up asking if there was any way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""texan"" gift package and sending it to them.

and that's it.  she is extremely happy and overjoyed.  i am really glad it's ""over"" as i had no idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent silver, gold, and platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***edit - i keep reading comments about the jewelers, and this being fake.  the daughter, son, and an uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  from what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  so, take that however you want, i have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have zero reason to be dishonest.  i really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  follow the old adage ""if you can't say something nice.....""

tl;dr - took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred.",8

in no time i reached out to the contact , at first i thought it was a blackmail scheme to extort me but at that point i actually do not give a fuck so i bumped the question, who are you and what do you want? after minutes of back and forth conversation, he revealed a lot of truth about my girl he found out on her various social media accounts and he was only trying to save me from future heartbreak.

i am worried about him. my family is blaming the school and each other right now. im disappointed in everyone else. they're trying to force him to hang out with them to make up for it, but of course nothing will make it up to him. what can i or they do/say to help him feel better?

edit : thank you for all the advice. i guess i didn't have to worry too much. he needed time alone to think it over in his room. he's definitely stronger than me and more mature. he said he hated feeling sad, so he stopped. also said he understood that everyone had other things to do. hopefully his next graduation is a lot better. maybe i'll post an update in 4 years. xd",8

throwaway account. indian here.

background

mine was an arranged marriage. met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. got married 2 years back. we are both from bihar. both educated. living in a metro city currently. we got along just fine.

my wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. we were having sex for just its sake. slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. no issues there. i always suspected something was off with her. one day something happened after which she got very emotional. i consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(i didnt ask how many times). her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. she just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. she said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). she didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

after 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. all these things stopped after fixing of marriage. she said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . i wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. think about family honour. what would relatives think if it got out.. it happened to me , not you. i dont want it to come out. past is past... all emotional storm.

this all happened 1.5 years back. from then i made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. always with me. we get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

now present problem :

we had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. but i don't want my baby to go even near that man. she is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. okay fine. nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. but just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. i cant let that man even near her. not now, not ever. i dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, i would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. just the thought of him touching my innocent child, i cant handle it. i dont know what im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? what should i do now ?

&#x200b;

**update**

the unequivocal suggestion i got from here was that i should not let her go . i called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. they understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that i can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). so i have to come up with a different solution. and that was of confrontation. i sat down my mil, and my wife and told both of them that i don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. first she tried to act aloof, but i maintained my strictness and told i don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to your daughter, and i will not let him do it to my daughter. period. get it through your head. after i made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, i won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. i again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. there was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. you could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... nobody could fake that.

i went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. that evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my mil had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. so i made my demands :

1. i only got leave for 1 week only, so i would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and i would return. not a day more. she would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. i would get return tickets beforehand.
2. she would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. she would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my fil, or i would publically make a scene, i won't care who is saying what. i would take my daughter from him and leave. period.

she was reluctant for the 3rd point, but i was adamant. she finally agreed. next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and i was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

for my wife part, after my mil left, i told her that im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. it's a coping mechanism. (didn't tell her i posted it online, or used the words like ptsd). she got defensive again. someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. was worried about it too. told her she need therapy. now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. i don't know, maybe she was hormonal. for 2 days she was pissed. and was definitely not ready to talk about it.

well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. i think here i did something of a fuck up. after normal checkups, i told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. i was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. i was sitting outside thinking i had fucked up the whole situation. but when i was called inside, my initial instincts were right. the doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). she referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. situation with my wife is tense now. she has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. we are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. i guess my mil will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. now i'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

we are leaving this weekend, hope i don't have to face any more drama there. will update if anything happens.

"my sister(f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46f) is pressuring me to, for families sake. i made a post yesterday but forgot my password so i made a new alt.

okay so i am a huge marvel nerd. the kind of nerd that cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. mostly fanservice.

my sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". she claims i am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

besides that we have a good relationship. we are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

so 3 years ago i managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the usa and meet the real stan lee! he signed one of my own pictures i did of the big 3 and complimented it. it's was one of the best days of my life.
since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

flash forward. a few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and i tell her no. reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. she pouted and i left the house.

when i come back is see my fucking stan lee autograph ripped up on the flor! i fucking lost it. then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). when she saw that i was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that i can get a new one.

i pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. she tries to engage in conversation but i shoot her down. she tries to bribe me with movie tickets and i tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. she hasn't apologized for it. she just says that i should be over it by now.

my mom says the same. she says a materialistic things shouldn't come in between family and that i should simply let it go. my dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. he is as big on marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. this whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

my mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and i think they both disrespected me. mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

i feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. can somone help me with this?

edit :thanks guys for listening to me. i feel a lot better. i will take what many of you said and i am going to send them examples of how much stan lee's autograph costs. but i think i have to word it very good so that they don't think that i would ""split up the family over money""

update : thanks for the support. my dad and i found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment. as you can imagine sister threw a fit and is staying with mom at my grandparents now.",8
"update i(28f) feel an irrational jealousy towards my son (3m) when my husband (31m) gives him lots of attention/affection. should i discuss it with my husband or will he be creeper out? has anyone else dealt with this? ok, i know this is an update no one cares about but i'm just so happy with what happened after i got advice here and i just need to tell someone hehe. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cd3zy5/i28f_feel_an_irrational_jealousy_towards_my_son/).

&#x200b;

so after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, i decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that i now wonder why i was ever worried. he reassured me that i wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that i just had a little problem that i needed help with. we're now looking for a good therapist for me. already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. i can't wait to work through this so i don't have to feel the way i do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

edit: thanks everyone for your kind words! reading these wonderful comments really made my day. honestly i didn't expect this to get so much attention, i was just very excited and felt like telling someone, anyone :)  even though i cannot reply to all these lovely messages, i truly appreciate them. thank you so much!",8
"middle schooler here- how do i stop my mom from posting my entire life on facebook? this is on a throwaway because my mom knows of my main account.

ever since i was born, my mom has posted literally every aspect of my life on her facebook account. everything. every baby picture, every ""first"" moment, every accomplishment and every failure. if we get in a fight, she's on fb asking for advice. 

for the past couple of years i've tried to install an ""ask me first"" policy, but since i don't have a fb account of my own, this is hard to monitor. i can only really tell when i manage to get into her phone. the last time i did this i saw some.. grade related stuff. 

i feel like i have absolutely no privacy. i can't talk to my own mother for fear she'll post it on social media. i'm her child, not her dog, and i'd like to be treated as a human being. however, i love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. this is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me. 

tldr: my mom didn't respect my wishes and stop posting personal things about me on facebook, how do i get her to understand how violated i feel?",8
"was i raped i've been seeing my girl for the past 4 months. shits been good but yesterday she had sex with me after saying i didn't feel like it. that day i worked a 14 hour day and had been up at 5 am, i was super tired. i went home and she wanted to play so i just complied at the beginning and just did some foreplay. i started to eat her pussy but i was legit falling asleep so i told her i'm too tired and all that. so i went to use the bathroom but she pushed me back to the bed, and was like i want you in me now i said no. she then just pulled my shorts off and rode me, i just froze i'm a pretty big dude close to 200 pounds and she's like 110 but that day i was to tired to do anything. after i came i felt really fucked. 
am i overthinking things or nah i feel like i'm partly responsible for playing with her and drive her over the edge but i feel really weird now. ",8
"my (29f) husband (31m) is no longer attracted to me after an accident that burnt my face. my husband and i have been happily married for 6 years and he has been nothing but a kind, attentive and caring spouse whom i love very much.

i attended a christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. i was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

my husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. i just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. he just looks differently at me now.

the other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. he kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. i know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

the next week we tried again and the same thing happened. he then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. it was soul crushing to hear that. he tries though. he cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? but how how can i if even i don't think i am?

tldr: i was in an accident that burnt half my face off and my husband no longer finds me attractive",8
"update my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry? original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure i owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. plus i've had some time to calm down. i probably wont reply to comments because otherwise i'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

if you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... and your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. it's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while i was at work. this was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. i dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. i'm not sure exactly what i was expecting her to say, but i genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

when i get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. not an apology. an ultimatum that if i went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering i owned the house before marrying her...)

i asked her if she was serious. if she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. yeah, okay. at this point i remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. i asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. i kept pushing her and she kept saying no. finally i told her that i had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  i explain that if i find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, i'm divorcing her immediately. she immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""only"". fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). i tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. she wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. i mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but jesus christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

i feel like i don't even know my wife. the woman i thought i married had some fucking empathy.

she still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. i explained she no longer has a say in the matter. had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, i would have listened to them and taken them seriously. but by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

i told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or i would call a divorce lawyer. i also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether i meet with this girl, but i would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

a few hours later she ""apologised"". i say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. but whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. so we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

tbh though, i don't think i'll ever see her the same way again. so i have doubts our marriage will last.",8
"update: i 22f broke up with my 34m boyfriend (7 months ago) because i found an engagement ring. he came to my work today and proposed. help me. please. first of all i'd like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. i know it was all over the place and at first i was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and i got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. i really appreciate it. 

if you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that i was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. well, i did. he came to my place after work. and i'm crying as i type this, because the majority of you were right about him. my heart feels broken and i don't know what to do from here. i can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and i can clarify things more now because i'm no longer defending him. this post is gonna be a very long post so, i'm warning you now you may be here long.

when he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if i needed any help then i could get it. he was not happy that she was there, i told him that's the only way i'll speak is if she's there because i don't think being alone together is appropriate.
first of all, he went on a tangent about how i should never of made that post and that i was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because i changed the password to the account before i made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. he was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
for those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

first of all it started with a tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. most of which, i weren't comfortable with. i mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""if you love me, you'll do it"", ""you know how happy it would make me"", ""you'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. he'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do cnc, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. the public posting of the experiences got him off and i wanted to make him happy.
and before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which i'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. stupidly i didn't question his intentions and i know i was naive, i just thought as i hurt him it was the least i could do. obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

we spoke about our sex life, and i asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew i was apprehensive, and he denied it. said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought i would enjoy all those things and i'd want to do them with him because the thought i would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). honestly, by this point when he was talking i could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. just from that, i started to feel a bit more sane and like i could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. i was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that i've not put any of what i have on you on social media, i could ruin your life but i choose not to because i love you and i'm not that type of person""
like, fucking really? who even says that? that's such a passive threat. so, now i'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. i told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 months of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. i told him i didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. he didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. told me i'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because i can't have kids so i'm useless to most men so i should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
i kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? and his response was ""you did for 4 years"". so, the majority of you were right, to him i was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. and all of this actually hurts, because i genuinely loved this person, and now i'm confused about how i could've been so naive to not notice anything. part of me thinks i was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that i missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

i gave him the ring back and told him i don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever i want (i've never been financially dependent on him, i have my own place) and do whatever i want him to do to make it right. i told him there's nothing i want from him anymore and that i want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. it wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and i'll remember why i love him. at which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. his face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

so he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. my friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. and that was the end of that.
now i'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, i've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so i can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
my best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last i hear from him, so at least if anything else happens i've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

thank you for all your advice, seriously. i received a lot of criticism on my last post but i'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when i was defending him and in denial, without you i wouldn't of had the courage to end it. i also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because i was so far under his spell.
i'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and i did genuinely love him, and now because i know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish i don't really know what to think, and i feel stupid and like an idiot that i didn't notice it. and now i don't know where i go from here, and i'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
i've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so i'll be starting the healing process soon. i guess i've gotta focus on myself now. i'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know i won't be going to any events if he's there etc, i've blocked him on all social media, i know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
i just hope i can get through this.

"i 34m just discovered the real side of my girlfriend 33f we had no issues before, and she was my role-model. i'm honestly shocked by this.

yesterday i got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the tv and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around christmas time.

after a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating christmas dinner. my girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""look at that crap dinner."" i didn't really react to her comment.

the mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""that looks like cow's placenta."" that's when i sat up and said ""are you serious?""

i told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" christmas dinner, i told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

then she said something along the lines of: ""yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

that was when i lost my shit and just went home. i haven't talked to her since. i'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

any advice appreciated.",8
"should i tell his wife that he is banging hella girls at my job? long story short. this married guy with 3 kids had fucked probably 5 women at my job. i denied him because he was married. but i did and was texting him there for awhile until he sent me a dick pic! lol anyways wife found my number and text me if i had slept with her husband i told her ""i"" did not. she is asking me for more answers! i want to tell her about her scum bag of a husband then part of me is like is this my place to say?

"shocking my gf sisters boyfriend has a crush on her i'm 25/m. i started dating this girl 22/f, it's only been 3-4 months, but alot has happened since then.

she has a sister 18/f and her sister has a boyfriend 21/m  who have been together for 6 months. when i first met her sister and her sister bf,  i thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. my gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes i think it was too much. 

little by little i started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. in the beginning i felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but i always thought ""maybe i'm trippin, that's just how they are, it's nothing"" and left it alone. 

then more weird shit happened. 
like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. it was weird to me bc she tells me that they're like a brother and sister. brothers and sisters don't dance that way. i ignored that situation and kept it moving.

another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. so he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. they switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  the weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and i asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. a picture says a thousand words. while my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. she posted that pic but deleted it after i said it was weird and people kept asking her ""who's the lucky guy"" .  at this moment i was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

as time went on and my gf and i got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. every time i would hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, i'd feel the hate in his eyes.  he'd mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her ""family"" (him and her sister). he would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. when my  gf would say no, he'd get angry. 

it got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. everything was all good. i wasn't there yet but when i arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. it was like that the rest of the night. 

when they left, i finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. we had a long talk about that situation and other things. at first she didn't see things that way i seen them but started to put two and two together. she didn't want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. she was not convinced but agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she'll be a little less friendly.  

at this time it was 10am, we still hadn't slept. her phone made the notification noise. i looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: ""lets fuck"" 

at this moment, we're both in shock. i grabbed the phone and showed her the dm. 

it was from her sisters boyfriend. 

her:  ""maybe that's them playing around"" 
me: ""you don't play around like that""

her: ""it could have been my sister writing that""
me: ""okay then, if that's what you think, let's                  call. if you're sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. if she sounds like she's just waking up, it wasn't her playing games. but if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he'll go.""
her: ""okay""

my gf calls, her sister answers, in a groggy voice. like she had just woken up.

gf: ""hey what are you doing?""
sister: ""i was sleeping what's up""
gf: ""where's your bf?""
sister: ""he's laying next to me""
gf: ""look at what he just sent me""
her sister hangs up. 

we call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

when we call back, gf sister answers. in the background, we can hear that they were arguing. a few seconds later, she hangs up and we don't hear from her again for the rest of the day.


a few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. my gf believed him, but still had her doubts. i in the other hand, don't believe it for various reasons. 

my gf and i spoke about it things and she said that she'll keep her distance. either way i let it go and decided to move on. he would continue to come around but it wasn't the same. 


few days went by. 

yesterday, i call her to talk and see how her day is going. she picks up, crying. she says she's at her sisters house. her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn't breathe. i tell her to call me back asap. 

time went by and i call to see what's going on. she picks up, i ask her what happened. she says she's home, her sister is doing fine, she's at the hospital with her parents. 

me: ""how come you aren't at the hospital with her also?""
her: ""they wouldn't let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and i was hungry so we left. 
me: ""who are you with?""
her: ""my sisters boyfriend, i told him to come instead of waiting there. ""

at this moment, i am bothered and disappointed. after all that we've been through, you're alone, in a house, with someone that you know i don't feel comfortable with. that's what i wanted to say, but did not say it bc i was on speaker. 

so we continue to talk while she starts to cook. there comes a point where her phone dies. i give her 8-10mins to call me back. (takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). she doesn't call, so i call her. no answer. i wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. i wait longer than 5mins this time and call. she picks up and says her phone died. 

me: ""how come you didn't call back after it died?"" (she usually does right away)
her: ""i was on the phone with my sister, she's ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride""
me: ""oh""

her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. my girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

she calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. we talk about the situation, and i patiently wait for them to leave so i can talk to my gf about how i felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

when they finally leave, i express myself to her and tell her how i felt. from that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- she says that  i have no right to feel the way i felt. that's her ""brother in law"".  and that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

i tell her, that i do have the right to feel bothered. it might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. i feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. 




i'd like to know what you guys think.  am i overreacting? or do i have a point. 

am i the only one that thinks it's weird?  what would you do in my shoes?

"update my best friend (20/m) at the time broke off our friendship 2 years ago because he said i (22/m) made him question his sexuality, and it still kills me everyday edit: for those who keep asking, or inferring, that we're gay. neither of us are gay or have interest in a relationship between us. we talked, he isn't gay. his worry back then was that he put all his effort into spending time with me, and not into dating and branching out and i trust his word. thanks for all the kind words. 

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

i wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. they, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. last friday night i drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. that was when i created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but i didn't know how. 

i decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided i would send that. i sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". i waited, not knowing how he'd respond. eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. so i asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on saturday's, and he said yeah. he asked me if i was going to go, and i said probably. he responded with ""cool! i'll be there"".

that was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. i was elated, i got so pumped up. we hung out all saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. we didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. he then asked if i wanted to hang out sunday too! we hung out all sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

then throughout this whole week while i was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. that, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. because it showed he wanted to talk to. eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. so that gave us a little chuckle. so we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing i have my best friend/brother back in my life. it honestly feels like i'm a different person with him being around. thanks for all the advice!

**tl;dr - reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**",8
"my (20f) boyfriend (20m) invites my best friend (20f) out to games, just the two of them. my boyfriend(lets call him j) and i have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her g) have been friends since grade school. j and g are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. they would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. however, i'm not really a sports person but still i would make the effort to attend their games. i would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. j plays football and g plays soccer.

j was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. i know its wrong to snoop but i couldn't help it. some his teammates were messaging him and i clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging g. i got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited g out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. g would decline and tell him that he should invite me. j then said that i wouldn't understand and that i was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. g said that he is being unfair to me. j still sends multiple messages to g about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

this has been going on for months. g has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that i should watch because those are j's favorite teams.

i kinda feel betrayed by both of them. although i feel more betrayed by j than g.

what should i do? how should i approach this?

**update**: thank you everyone for your advice. i approached g first and told her that i've seen the messages. she was relieved that i came to her and talked to her about it. she explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. she also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. we both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

i also have to admit that snooping through j's messages are wrong. the reason i did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and i was feeling insecure and worried about it. but it still does not justify the way i went about it.

as for j, we will meet up later tonight. i honestly think it is over between us. he also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. i would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**update 2**: g told me that i should start by saying ""hey, g told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and i did exactly that. j became defensive and told me that he never invited her. i told him that i saw the messages and he asked if g showed me the messages. i told him the truth that i saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. he told me that i violated his privacy and i apologized for it. then he told me that he was asking out g because his friends felt that g was a lesbian. he was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. at this point i'm like ""whaaaaat?!"". he said that he was doing that to protect me and i'm like what?. he then left and told me that he needed space and that i should text him after i got my head cleared up. i texted him ""stay away from me and g"". that was honestly a wild ride.",8
"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to last vegas in january, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37m). this has been a whirlwind of events. i am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

my gf and i have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. this all changed and i no longer know the person i once loved. full disclosure: i have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. she has had the wool over everyones eyes.

in 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to las vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from jan 11 – 14. what could go wrong.

come christmas time, said friend (60f) from las vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate christmas in canada. she has a son (37m). over christmas eve, christmas day, and boxing day, we hung out at this families air bnb house in our hometown and i got to know them very well. i consider myself to be very observant, and i noticed zero interaction between the son (37m) and my girlfriend (24f). after christmas, the family flew back to las vegas and awaited our arrival for the january weekend.

here is where i should have clued in, which i partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. about a week before las vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to las vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'girls trip.' my girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me i wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me i cannot come; accommodations have been rearranged and i'm no longer invited on the trip. given that i had paid for this trip, i was visibly upset. i expressed that i didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something i was invited to. ultimately, she left the decision up to me. i decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless i was convinced she wanted me there, which i wasn't. friday came and went, she flew with her mom, i stayed home.

my girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (the lie detector test determined that was a lie.) she stayed a few days extra and flew back. she met up with me the following friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. i protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. maybe one day we would get back together.

this leads us all to today. for the last month, my ex girlfriend and i have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. she has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so i thought). she and i would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. she and i both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. on valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

after struggling to move on with my life i decided today was the day i would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. by pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

i called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. him and i got along great and he said i'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. she is in banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""i'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. if you knew everything, i don't think you'd be here. i have been told by gf, gf mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but i have a lot of respect for you. my ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and i know how it feels. anything you ask me, i will answer completely honestly.""

confused, i sat down where everything had been explained to me. my girlfriend had begun an affair in las vegas with the son (37f) of her moms best friend. every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to las vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to banff with the whole family. keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). i am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. i don't even know how this happened.

i cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. i feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. suffice to say, i am in an absolute state of shock.

i simply texted her saying ""i know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

i'm completely lost reddit. i thought i was going to marry this girl one day. how does someone change in the blink of an eye. i learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than i did over the course of 3.5 years.

where do i go from here? advice very much welcome.

update: thanks for all the comments everyone. i've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and i've been being blamed for it all. i haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. after denying what had taken place, i just assume at this point it will be more lies. she has every reason to lie about it. whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. thanks again everyone for the support and advice. the succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media.

**tl:dr** – my girlfriend of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to las vegas only to cheat and carry on an affair with her family friends son. she has been lying to me ever since and has been flying down to vegas and other cities to meet him and stay with him and his 2 kids.",8
"update my (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22m) tried to spike my drink. this is the link to my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my\_21f\_boyfriends\_friend\_both\_22m\_tried\_to\_spike/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my_21f_boyfriends_friend_both_22m_tried_to_spike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

after reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. we spent most of the night there.  i told them about what i saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when i wanted to leave. they asked me lots of questions: if i am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk i was, how drunk he was, if i had ever liked him etc. it was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

the police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. they did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. i am not sure if i can do that, he has sent me a message asking how i was that i showed my boyfriend but i haven't answered him yet. i am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

after coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. we haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. so that's it for now. i don't want to have to talk to him or face him but i will have to anyway. this is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

edit: i just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-i didn't feel the police was victim blaming, i am sorry if i made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and i did tell them everything: there is no history between me and s, we became friends through my bf and common interests and i showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. they talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say i made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. i am in a big city in europe, i guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. the officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me i could come directly to him if i felt threatened by s.

\-i am not makng this up, i have read comments suggesting i did and it honestly hurts. i am not crazy and i never wanted things to get this messed up. this guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-my bf and i aren't telling s we went to the police. i gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but i can't do it. i also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

i am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. and i am so grateful for the support, i wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it.",8
"i (27m) found pictures of my girlfriend (23f) topless on the beach at night with strangers a bit of background: my girlfriend and i have been together for 5 years. we have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. we manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. i'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. recently i got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. i didn't previously plan to go there, but i was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and i liked the company. she's renting a house with one male flatmate and i suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. this was all just to test the ground as i wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. she told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. given this reaction, i didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. this made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing i couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason i wanted to move was to stay with her. i told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, i would look for jobs in other cities and go where i could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. after we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200b;

the fact: when she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. i was naturally a bit jealous but i thought she was innocently having fun. i'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago i went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. the morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. the only thing i saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. at this point i was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. we stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. she showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. all other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. she was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. i don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. i'm heartbroken since i saw that picture and i feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. i would have never expected her to do this to me, and i also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. i asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. she said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. this makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200b;

i sent her away on a train this morning and told her i want to spend my vacation alone and told her i'm considering breaking up. right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and i held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200b;

i feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also i'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. however, it's very difficult for me to break up. our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. however, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and i don't feel i can trust her anymore afterwards. is there a way to recover or are we done for?

i'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. when i told her i'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that i'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&#x200b;

one additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. i want to go with her anyway. am i being too soft? how should i handle it?",8
"(update) brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make jw parents think i'm not gay. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

thank you all for your illuminating comments. i'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. but i'd like to specifically thank u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. you were exactly right.

today we talked for the first time since our conversation. he took down the insta after our conversation (which i hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and i gently asked why, exactly, he did this. he's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""i'm being abused and need to leave the jw."" what he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). he still believes in god and wants to explore different sects of judeo-christianity. my hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the jw are...they're, like, ""those people"". so he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

his motive was pretty much what u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. he said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew exactly where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. so in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. i told him i was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. he apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. i think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

i established myself as a lifeline. i told him that if it ever gets too much, i will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (and i mean it: i have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). he seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

as for my parents, i just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. if they ask (and this was suggested by julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that i might have refound christianity but i have no intentions to return to the watch tower, and that he stopped talking to me. leaving jw for any reason is grounds for excommunication. and i put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. they might think i'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that i'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

and for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. no fifteen year old can act this well. he's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

thank you all, again. my brother is back in my life, and i now have the means to help him. thank you, thank you, thank you.

**tl;dr: my brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. i told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, i will be here for him to move in with. the insta is deleted. thank you.**",8

&#x200b;

i wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. it's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200b;

my ex did move out. thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. and as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a huge relief. i didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. i could breathe again. i was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

aaaand then i got laid off. no joke. helluva one-two punch right there.

the past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. the year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year i had to spend recovering from that blow. i had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as i found a new job i also found out my house needed hugely expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, i just didn't have the cash for. and figuring out how to be on my own for a while - i had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess i was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (bingeing 'the marvelous mrs. maisel' helped a bit.)

he also kept reaching out. for a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and i came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, i distanced myself. he messaged me once to ask if i regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if i thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. i didn't respond to that one at all. then he'd reach out with things like ""hey, the tv i took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? like to sell or try and fix?"" i've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which i said that i wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (he also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. i have no words.)

&#x200b;

the good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job i got is possibly the best job i've ever had. a step down in salary, but i'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and i've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that i think i can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. i had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and i was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which i'd never done before. but i did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and i absolutely love the car.

also - i met someone new. this person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. he treats me really well. he's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. in the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. he's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and i'm not broken either, thank god. maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. this relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and i'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200b;

and one more bit of good news - i will officially be divorced on friday! (yes, the day after valentine's day xd ) there are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200b;

i wanted to provide this update in part because i know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because i wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. it can get better. it really, really can. i'm actually happy. it took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - i'm definitely going to need a lot of time to recover financially, and i'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (a+++++ for therapy) - but i'm actually truly happy. sometimes i wonder how much of the depression i'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight i'd been carrying for so long - his and mine - without truly being aware of it. it's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but i'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",8
"m (20) my girlfriend is going blind i'm 20 years old. and i've been with my girlfriend with one year. she's extremely unique and amazing, i love her more than anything. but she's losing her vision, she had a cataract removed when she was 6 years old and among many other extremely rare medical cases she has, and all the other terrible people she's been in relationships with, makes me extremely in love twitch her(sorry to be cheesy), she has 50% of her vision in her left eye but her right eye is 20/20. she's lost her peripherals so bad she can't see me when she's 45 degrees facing me. she's losing her green and blue in her eyes and she's also on a list for a service dog. her and i are very stressed about her most likely going blind within 3 years. we've had the talk about how her previous partners have left her because of her health problems (even though she's a literal walking fucking miracle, i can explain more if anybody's curious) but i'm so in love that i don't want to give up on her even if she goes blind one day. i've never given up easy in relationships and never will. but i'm just looking for advice to give her as she's very stressed about most likely going blind, cheers.",8

&#x200b;

well, it's been like 12 days. the long and the short of it: the truth came out. wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and i am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. i need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200b;

a lot of people said some things that really struck with me. the photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. why would he take a picture that was so compromising? why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? how was he so cavalier? i sat her down and demanded the whole truth. we talked the night that i posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. we went moment by moment, step by step, and i demanded to know what happened. so, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200b;

they got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. they drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. they got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *get high.* but on what you might add? oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. yeah, fucking lovely. my mil had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. they all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the moh's surprise - a stripper. so, who took the pills *and drank?* only my future wife. yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. it's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. my fiancee doesn't drink, so i should have connected the dots there. that's on me i guess.

&#x200b;

the reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. stripper never fingered her. she kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. the photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. she then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that i would leave her. she said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. she was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. i couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. i thought the pills were destroyed but i guess my fiancee didn't do that - i had no reason to assume she would lie. in the years we've been together/known each other she's drank maybe 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. i didn't think she'd do that.

so, that brings me to the texts. i ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. she explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that i was going to find out and leave her. her moh, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. by this point i didn't know what to do.

i followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. she began to panic and begged me not to. she started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever i wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. she then said she had a problem and needed help, her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. she said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. that i don't actually doubt, i think she really does love me.

&#x200b;

so what happened?

&#x200b;

she saw her doctor on monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. we got the name of the doctor and i guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. he recommended different types of therapy. we had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. she's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. we're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200b;

this meant that i had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. he knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. my parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. my fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. the bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. they admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. she drank way too much and they didn't stop her. i thanked them for their apology but said i didn't know what to say. they just offered their apologies and said that i was a great guy.

&#x200b;

the long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. we aren't having sex. we are right now in this weird healing phase. her team has recommended i see individual therapy which i haven't yet had the time to do. a lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, i guess. my parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200b;

fiancee and i are in a weird place. she's overly nice and sympathetic. since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. she submits to drug tests and we have a bactrack if i'm concerned she's drinking. i'm a lot more aware of what's going on. she's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. she's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200b;

i kind of feel like i got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. people keep telling me to watch out for myself, but i'm not sure what to do.

&#x200b;

so that's what happened. i'm stunned and confused. turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. i still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. for now, i'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",8
"final post on: i'm a female born without a vagina. how do i tell a guy that i'm interested in about it? original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

updated post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

i was going to make this an edit but due to its length, i figured to make it a separate post. i don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but i sincerely apologize if i am in the wrong.

i just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things i've mentioned in the comments briefly. i hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

but before i do that, i want to thank everyone who sent me a dm, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. i've read through all of them, but i haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. you have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much i appreciate it. i love you all <3

# quick update:

i texted kyle yesterday and he replied. i asked him how he was feeling. he said he was even more sick than earlier. i said i was too, and i said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). i told him about how i had a volunteer thing at university which i went to and how i nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. but that was it. we didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

in addition to this, i haven't called the number my ta gave me because they are only open monday - friday from 8am to 4pm. so, i'm going to be doing that on monday, hopefully.

# my condition:

the exact name for my condition is mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome, or mrkh syndrome for short. it affects 1 in every 5000 women. a lot of people, i'm assuming they were trolls, stated that i was a guy or something along those line. just to clarify, i am a woman, i look like a woman physically and i've felt like a woman my whole life. i was genetically born with xx chromosomes. being a woman is not something i doubt.

there are basically 2 types of branches within mrkh. type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. this may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. i have type 1. there are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. i am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# diagnosis:

a lot of people were confused as to why i was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did i find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

the way mkrh works is that it affects internal reproductive organs. this means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. from the outside, i look like a normal female. i have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. i am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. my ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why i am still physically able to look like a female. for me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, i have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. for 18 years of my life, i lived thinking i was just like any other girl. i never once suspected anything wrong.

when i started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. but this was around the time i started to feel like something was wrong. one main reason was that i hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that i wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. for some reason, at the time, i assumed periods and fingering went together. i thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. its weird looking back at that now haha.

i went to the doctors one day (this was before i started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. this is probably one of the most common ways women with mrkh find out about it. the doctors simply assumed that i was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. i was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. i was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. the following year, i got my shit together on my own. i joined the wrestling team, track team, and i started doing weight training. as a result of this, i was also eating way more, and i gained a lot of muscle mass. i got my weight up to 120lbs. when i still hadn't gotten my period, i went back to the doctors. they still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. i had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. i didn't feel like everything was normal, so i switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. needless to say, i was getting tired of blood tests because i knew they didn't show anything. one doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but i think that was circumstantial. prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that i had breast discharge which is something i had never experienced before in my life. some how, i can't exactly remember which doctor, i ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. i diligently took the bc pills every day. nothing happened. this is when i thought, ""is it just me or does healthcare in canada suck?"".

then another doctor suggested i get a pelvic ultrasound done. this is when they found the issue. the poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. the doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. she stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom i had mrkh. she said according to the ultrasound i had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). she literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. i walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. his response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and i could hear him. and then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". i came home, and i did some googling and started to learn more about mrkh. i had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and i texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. i also added that if it changed anything between us, that i would understand, and i wouldn't hold it against him. as much as i might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something i really needed at the time.

after the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a sickkids hospital in downtown toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. they started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. they had me get an mri done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an mri. i also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. i ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because i didn't have one. the look on their face was hilarious as i'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. after i met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, i was properly informed that i did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but i was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. i was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. they had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. the depth of it was about 3mm deep. it was actually quite painful, and i hated doctors by this point anyways.

# family situation:

my parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are highly taboo. everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know english well so most of the time when i went to the doctors, i went with my dad. it was very weird and awkward. the few times my dad refused to go with me, i went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

after my last appointment with sickkids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. my dad took those from me and threw them out, saying i didn't need them. they also asked if i would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that i didn't it. going to therapy at the hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. i can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which i don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but i don't have time due to school. i actually got a letter from the hospital in september about a pretty cool mrkh conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. i really really wanted to go. but again, it was far. i figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, i could definitely bus there. the event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. it was unrealistic for me to go. so then i told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. they'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" i tried arguing that it was exactly the opposite of that, and that they want to inform you that you are women despite the lack of certain organs. they responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) i had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

i had someone telling me that i need to stand up to my parents. my parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. unfortunately, due to the circumstances that i don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something i refuse to do. i am well aware of the shitty situation i am in. i know they are being abusive, in more than one way. i've thought long and hard about it, and i've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. i'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. i've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# surgery:

i had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. in my first post, somewhere in the comments, i believe i said something along the lines of ""im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why i can't get surgery yet. lucky for me, i live in canada and i have health insurance! surgery is definitely an option for me. but due to my family situation, they believe that i wont need surgery until after i get married because i mean its not like i'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# additional comments:

1. a lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that i could look into doing anal. it's all about personal preference, and i hate it. its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. i can look into the asexual community, but i am not asexual. i may not be able to satisfy my needs, but i do have a pretty high sex drive, and i do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. i don't know if i would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. a lot of people had a lot to say about how i handled the situation. some saying i did the right thing, and others saying i did it too soon. honestly, i haven't figured out the right way to go about it. i have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. i once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""aren't you surprised i still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" i was so taken aback by it, i didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. someone said that ""if a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, i'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. so he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". true, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his ibs. i didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was relevant to what was happening. i evaluated the situation i was in with kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so i had to tell him. agree or not, first date material or not, i'm going to stand by with what i did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. i am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest i do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. i don't want to publicly display it to guys i'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. i know guys who also use those dating apps, and i don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. the guy i ended up calling on tuesday night, after i left kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. he has told me that it wouldn't bother him. i had a lot of messages telling me that i shouldn't friend-zone him, and that i should give him a chance. here is the real reason why i'm not attracted him nor why i would never ever give him a chance: he's basically doing nothing with his life. he's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. whereas i on the other hand, i work part-time, i study my ass off in school, and i make time to do extra curricular stuff. i also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. but i treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. i'm not saying i'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am i saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. i'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and i'm not into that. in addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. he was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". i was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, i am. there is no way i am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. i think one of the main reasons i even turned to reddit in the first place was because i am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and i don't want them finding out. there was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me i can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications i got.

this is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. i hope i answered some questions. i really do appreciate all the support i got. thank you, and take care everyone <3

edit: i'm only doing this to feel better about myself: kyle replied. ""i definitely do not want to get involved"". fuck you, kyle. if y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. i welcome it with open arms. 

edit: i think i forgot to address this earlier. for those of you asking whether i can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. my clitoris is underdeveloped. stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? i don't know. i haven't tried. 

edit: guys. i. can. still. pee. i have a urethra. you do not put a guys pee-pee in the same place you pee from. simply anatomy. ",8

"update: me (36m) found out that my wife (34f) was cheating on me with multiple men in my original post i was still unsure what to do as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

but after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, i got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. i finally opened my eyes to what i had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that i would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so i decided last thursday to tell her i wanted to end this marriage.

i think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. she didn't even try to persuade me or anything. just went like a broken record ""nothing i say will change anything"" whenever i asked her to say anything. there was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. we have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

my mother knows everything, but i for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. maybe i'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so i agreed to give her time to tell them. when we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. they have been part of my family for almost 17 years and i care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. i felt really bad about lying to them, but i'm afraid that if i go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. but my patience is not limitless. i will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

i don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. i'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". i also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

now there are some big loose ends to tie. we need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. the custody will be shared where i will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. i also feel like their legal address should be with me, so i won't have to pay her child support. would be unfair after what she did. i have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. i will fight for my kids though.",8
"wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair my wife died this past week unexpectedly. she was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. i thought things had hit rock bottom. she essentially died in front of me, and i was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

all things considered, i was coping as well as could be expected. make no mistake, i was going through the expected grieving reactions. i raged and hysterically cried for days. i went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. but i have good friends and i have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

in the process of going through her belongings i discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. it looks like she started cheating during a period where i was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. after mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, i was back at a new job. however, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that i was distant to her. in the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

what more can life do to me? this man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. he appears to be the exact opposite of me. i am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. the logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but i could never have imagined this. 

i am absolutely and totally devastated. the only saving grace is that we never had children. i wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. i suppose now i know the truth of why. 

i feel like i will never be happy again. ",8
"i (26 f) used to be a prostitute. then i met a man who became my friend (36 m) at a cafe. now i have my ged and am a receptionist. i have a child with cystic fibrosis. i would watch him during the day and work at night. my sister lived with us and she would watch him at night. 

i would go to a cafe before i started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. my friend was there typing on a laptop. we started talking and i found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

i told him i never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my ged. the next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. he helped me study and i passed. 

he helped me get a job as a receptionist.  i can afford better care for my child. 

we are still friends and i have fallen in love with him. i'm not sure if he could ever like me in that way. 

is it worth asking him if he does or not? or do you think that would ruin our friendship?

i'm not sure he would want to be with me because of my past.

"final update - my (24f) best friend (24f) says i owe her everything i have, including my boyfriend previous post   
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9j5ig0/update\_my\_24f\_best\_friend\_24f\_says\_i\_owe\_her/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9j5ig0/update_my_24f_best_friend_24f_says_i_owe_her/)

&#x200b;

i said i'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200b;

ex-bf kept trying to get in touch through common friends. they kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if i was really sure it happened. they offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so i'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. but i've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. to the ones who insisted i told them i wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, i'd block them too.

i ran into ex bf at this book thing i go to often (hobby of mine). maybe i'm being presumptuous, but i think he went there for me. he didn't really have any business there, but i'm just speculating really. he asked if i had a few minutes for coffee, i said i was late (lie). he walked me to my car. he looked so good, smelled great. he was so sweet. was even wearing his hair the way i like it. i fell horrible cause even after everything, i still like him. he apologized some more, said he knew i needed time and space but asked if i'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. said he would never talk to jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. and i just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. which i don't. so i told him i wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. i wish i said something snappier or wittier. but i had nothing.

this was saturday, i haven't heard from him or friends since. i think that was that. 

&#x200b;

jessie also kept trying to talk to me. like i told some of you on comments, i had a trip coming up, it would have been me, jessie, ex bf, and a few friends. since jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. she must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause i had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). she went crazy. even showed up at my place (i wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). i didn't block her at first cause i admit i was having some fun watching her despair.

i talked to my mom and she was amazing. told me i should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. so i did. and for one last bit of print screen drama: i printed all the emails i got confirming cancellations and sent those to jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200b;

my roommate has been amazing. we were never really close and now i don't even know why. she cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200b;

a few of you suggested i see a therapist and i did, yesterday. i really liked it. it was just one appointment and i mostly just talked, but it felt good. she gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. made me realize she was never really my friend. she was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. therapist also told me about this saying (i think that's what it is) called ""the narcissist's prayer"", which goes something like ""that didn't happen. if it did, it wasn't my fault. if it was, i didn't mean it. and if i did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how jessie is handling this whole thing now.

so good riddance indeed

&#x200b;

and a final piece of gossip. ""pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said jessie was super sure that since i broke things off, she and dean would hook up right away. but apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. and yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

i guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. the thing is, i don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. i want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. i thin i deserve that.

&#x200b;

i am also thinking about taking the money i got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. haven't decided though.

&#x200b;

anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that i will have anything new to add

now, i think i just need time to heal and let go, you know?

i might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but i wanted to post this update now cause i wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. and, of course, thank you all again!! you are the best!!

&#x200b;

 tldr it's all good. as well as could be, anyway! thank's reddit!",8
"my 30 m wife 30 f lied to me about where she was yesterday. update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

i hate that i'm having to write this but here it goes.

my wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. she mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or starbucks if she really needs to focus. we aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

this does require quite a lot of trust as i've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

my wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. she has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

it occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was mlk day and all the library's were closed. no big deal, i figured she'd just go to a panera or something and then head to her class. when she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. i asked her how her day went and she said ""it was good. the library was good, i got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which i liked."" i didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. while she was in the shower i decided to get on facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

there were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

i haven't said anything to her about it yet and i can't help but suspect the worst. it is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. anyway, i don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

edit 1: i called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. the gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

edit 2: so i came home for lunch after reading all the messages. pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". so i'm torn. 

i did, while i'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnq74ds.jpg . there are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... and sexy red underwear. i don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... this sucks. 

morning update: wow... so thanks to everyone who reached out about this. it was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but i really appreciate it.

i decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who i've know practically my whole life. he was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. i haven't begun to do that yet but i will in the next few days.

last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as monday. again, this is somewhat typical for her. i have a second job that i work tuesday / thursday and so m/w are usually her gym days. what is a little strange is the studying away from home again. she does is sometimes but it's rare and i can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. she gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""how do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". i guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place i could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. i doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. that's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. the other part is that i am going out of town this weekend, leaving friday night and returning sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. if she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. the gym photo. i do know the photo is from monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the facebook post that solidify that. i also checked their instagram later and there were more pictures from monday as well. however it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


i will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. i don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. i honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. that's all for now, i might update in a few weeks if anything changes. thanks guys. 

oh and shoutout to u/vh3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

"my(24f) coworker(50f) blamed me for my miscarriage (update) it's been a long day. first, i want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. i wasn't able to answer everyone but know i tried to read all of them. thank you.


so, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. now, yesterday i was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. she did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. she saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming i wasn't working. what she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'i still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him i wasn't on the application and i wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


my boss calmly assured her that i was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (i get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong i guess, doubled down and was upset i hadn't communicated that to her. i didn't even know. my boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and i guess they talked in circles for a bit. he let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. she had nothing. 


when i spoke to my boss, at this point i was upset. i finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. he was not pleased. he did let me know i don't have to explain myself and that next time if i'm in that situation to go straight to him. he offered his condolences for my loss.


as for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. she has a laundry list of people to ask before me. he told me to document everything. anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


today, she hasn't been around me. she even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. she hasn't said a word all day. it's been a wave of relief for me.


tldr: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. she is now not allowed to speak to me.

"update my (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but i feel uncomfortable edit obligatory link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgd49d/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a_massive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

so i added this to the original post yesterday but i felt like a lot of people who saw the original probably didn't see the update, so here it is in it's own post.

so i woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. i called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that i tell her why i was so panicked. reluctantly i showed her my post. 

we've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. i think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

first of all, what i picked up from her. i didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although i had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so i found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. i also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

what she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

what we both learned about me is that i have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. from this to the fact that i go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because i was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). that's something that i need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though i feel uncomfortable. 

so now the all important part where i tell you the decision we came to. we decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when i feel like i've worked through the root issue enough. 

tl;dr we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when i've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.

edit shout out to the people acting like not doing one sexual act is going to lead to an unfulfilling sex life for my girlfriend. you guys are the real mvps coming to bat for my girlfriend who was actually a large hand in forming this solution. she may think she knows what she's cool with but you guys definitely know better. /s",8
"just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from aita (deleted from so reposting here.)

i met my boyfriend through a local dnd facebook page. we started talking every day over messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. we had a lot of stuff in common, and i thought he was really funny, and i just enjoyed his company. we started dating and we've been dating for nearly a year. we moved in together in may.

however, yesterday i found out from one of our dnd friends that he used to comment on r/braincels . he brought it up in a ""good for him for moving on"" way but holy fuck. i only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. i managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. his last post he mentioned that he was talking to a ""foid"" and that she was actually showing interest. i think he meant me.

he was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but i don't think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. he's never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do i know he doesn't still feel that way? would i be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? should i give him a chance to explain? i love him and i don't know if i can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. but i also don't think i can continue to be with him knowing he things i'm not deserving of the same respect as men.

added info from last post: he's never done anything i consider a red flag, but i also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. i feel like my trust has been breached. 

do i end things? give him the chance to talk? or give him a chance?",8
