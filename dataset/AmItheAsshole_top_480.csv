"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

edit 2: i've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent tl,dr: ""you're not wrong walter, you're just an asshole""",3
"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"update: for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. everyone's comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

since i received such great advice on my original post, i felt like i had an obligation to update. and i'm trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

we went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

i'm doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

i haven't reached out to any of marcy's family and i don't plan to. i understand now how devastating that would be. 

that's it. take care everyone.",3
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"for making a dad joke?. note. my step-daughter, madeline, was about a year old when i married her mother, jessica. madeline's father died before she was born. 
 
madeline is currently 15, and she's rebelling for almost everything. she did something bad, so while picking her up, i set a punishment up for her. then she said ""you're not my dad. i don't have to follow you"". honestly, i got a bit hurt from that. but i understand that she didn't mean it, and that she'd probably change. i just replied ""i'm still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules."" 
 
that happened about 2 days ago. so our family was going grocery shopping, when madeline said ""i'm hungry. i need food."" i decide to be extremely cheeky and say ""hi hungry, i'm not your dad."" my son just started to laugh uncontrollably. my daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. and my wife was berating me ""not to stoop down to her level."" 
 
i honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. and my son agrees. so aita?
 
edit: i did adopt her. so legally i am her parent.

 
mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

family is blaming me for their marital problems. i refuse to accept i did anything wrong. my sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all i did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",3
"for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger ""tig bitties""?. pretty much the title. my son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night and said he had named him ""tig"". he asked me what its last name should be. i couldn't help myself and just instantly replied ""bitties"". then i turned to my wife to share a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but my son insisted that he liked ""bitties"", so now his tiger is tig bitties. my wife thinks it was completely inappropriate, i think it was a silly joke that went over his head and will have no negative ramifications.",3
"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


anyway. aita?",3
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: she 100% knows that i am his girlfriend, i have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",3
"for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?. **updated 7:50 pm:** holy crap! thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. i never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! i had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when i checked back in after work. several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200b;

my intent was to answer more questions since i wasn't able to do that while at work. i was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however i've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what i have already posted if i wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200b;

just a couple things i want to address in my update here. some people are saying i'm leaving out details. my original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. i had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so i apologize if it looks like details have been left out. i did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. lastly, my son is now back with me. there was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200b;

i'm sorry if i didn't respond to your comment or private message. i'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. i can't even begin to put into words how grateful i am. again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"so we decided to fuck with the sub.. # major update: 60 minute contest mode & extension of beta testing to august 14. 

**we have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. the beta test will be extended to august 14.** it has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. we ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. please see below for some comparative information!

**we noticed massive increases in time until top comment**

> before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> with the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (around 30-40% increase)

> with the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). this is an incredible increase and very rare for reddit as a whole. we're taking this as a win. (around 120-150% increase)

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**more information to be seen! we will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him. 

he told my family and they think i'm the asshole. aita?",3
"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off i feel like i unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. for ruining my parents marriages?",3

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

i told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


edit:  i see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  i suggest you read the full rule book and the faq if you think you've got a new idea.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?. i fucking hate wedding culture.

it's bullshit.

my fiance and i thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. we were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

then the demands started coming out. they wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person has to be a groomsman, etc etc. suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

we put our foot down and said:

>thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. when we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. with so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>if you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. but if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

this has caused an epic shitstorm. such to the point where i have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. my parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

we are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"for purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?. this issue is honestly making me frustrated. almost everyone is saying i am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and i genuinely don't know if what i did was correct or not. i just feel so lost. please, please do help.

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

"for calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after i asked her multiple times not to.. i have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. i'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. she is very overweight. all the time she makes comments about my weight. she doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and i even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". i have only worked there 8 days. i have asked her very nicely to stop. yesterday i asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

"for not wanting to pick up my wife from the airport at 12:30 am?. backstory: my wife is coming back from a four day business trip. her flight is just under three hours, and she will be landing around 12:30 am. airport is about 30 mins away from our home. she generally hates flying in this late, and asked if i could come pick her up from the airport (**to clarify:** the airport is o'hare. it's a huge, busy airport. there are hundreds of business travelers coming through even at 1 am, and a huge fleet of taxis / ubers standing by to take them home. if this was a little airport and she was waiting by herself for a taxi for 20 mins, you would not be reading this post. as much as people are sensitive to it, safety is realistically not a huge issue here.)

i have to get up early and commute to work the next morning, and wouldn't be getting home until 1-1:30 am. i get why she wants me to come, and i know it would be the good thing to do..... but i also feel like she'd be completely fine just taking a taxi this one time... am i just being lazy, or am i being a lazy asshole here reddit?

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

edit: okay, so many of y'all are right. i suppose i should separate how i feel about their (ridiculous/delusional/stupid) reasoning with the fact that no one should have an image of themselves online that they don't want made public. i'll take it down.",3

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3
"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

a few people at the office have commented that i'm the jerk for ignoring ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

okay. i'm the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. so i waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, i honk. she then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which i already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. each time she makes an attempt to order something i honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. we stopped as soon as she drove off. we then ordered and went about our day.

"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3
"for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?. i'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who i love very much. i've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and i enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me."" 


then i left the restaurant without her. i don't know what occurred to me but i probably shouldn't have done that, but i guess it kinda just snapped. aita?",3
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3
"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3
"for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that i cheated on her?. i know the title sounds absolutely terrible. 
 
my ex and i were together for 5 years. i decided to propose, but she rejected me. the next day, we had a talk. she realized that she was gay, since ""i've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". we broke up.
 
the very next day, i get bombarded with text messages. my friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. it was a facebook (who uses facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. she said that's why we broke up. now i usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. she was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. i simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. people didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. i know i'm probably a huge asshole. though i feel like she deserves it.

"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3
"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3
"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior. i'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her ipad out and starts watching a show quite loud. 

to me this is a foul in public however i just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones.

i said she was absolutely right and i am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and i will do  the same.       i then proceeded to take out my ipad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. 

i have never seen someone storm off so mad. 

quick edit. i turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. ",3
"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?. i love strawberries. i love them so much that i planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. after i harvest, i make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. i donate the leftovers to my local food bank.

lately i've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. the last time i caught them i threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

i caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police i grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. 

i just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. one parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iphone 10 was ruined with water. i told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. then i threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.",3
"for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents?. i got married on saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. they knew the ceremony time, and my husband and i made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. the venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. 

so the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. my husband and i both called them multiple times but nobody answered. we waited and waited, and still heard nothing. finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. i was really pissed off at this point. the wedding coordinator asked if i wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and i said yes. all of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. 

my parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. it turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. they only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. obviously there's no way i could have known this.

i'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there. aita?",3
"for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

i was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean. 

last week i got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on facebook that marcy had od'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming thursday.

i immediately just burst into tears because i hoped that this would never happen and i feel so much guilt over it. 

i want to go to the funeral service for her but i'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. at the most i would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. i need to do this for myself.

"meta: warning for all posters: what happens in does not stay in aita!. it would seem that some popular social media personalities have decided that this is a great sub for content. the ""god"" facebook page likes to mine content, look for assholes, and put them on blast via thedodo. a recent poster has also said the the ""news"" page the mirror picked up his post as well. i'm sure there are others.

a lot of you post about stuff because your friends and family aren't on reddit, but now we need to be careful as to what other social media they may be on, and take extra steps to preserve your anonymity. throwaways are already encouraged, but make sure names are changed enough (not just initials), and change any non-relevant details. good luck!

"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3
"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3
"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3
"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3
"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you. 

i will accept any judgment",3
"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

"for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.. i'm(22m) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. we're very close and we have always been like that. he lives with me now obviously. he often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so i comfort him as best as i can. 

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3
"update: for refusing to give my newborn's social security number to my aunt.. link to a snapshot of my op(https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

moral of the story: trust your gut on financial matters. while my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can't be too careful these days.",3
"update - if i still give my stepson the birthday gift i bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift will upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?. hi reddit, just dropping by to give you an update to my post. 

 https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta\_if\_i\_still\_give\_my\_stepson\_the\_birthday/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta_if_i_still_give_my_stepson_the_birthday/) 

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

thank you all for your comments and i wish everyone the best.",3
"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3
"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3
"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

obviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides bursts of anger and then ghosting.",3
"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

second edit: wow this is on the front page, i never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! i'm sorry i can't reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",3
"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

so pardon my french, but what the fuck?",3
"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3

"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3
"for turning the home i inherited into an airbnb? my sister thought it would be a ""family home"" forever..  i will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. about six months or so ago my grandpa died. for simplicity sake, let's say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. in his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  his estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in california. basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. m

i got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. for the last six months i've allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but i just got my first tax bill and i either have to sell it or start making some income off it. after talking to the real estate agent i've decided the best course of action is to put it on airbnb. that way i can still use it if i like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there's not someone renting full-time.

 my sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all i know she's upset because she can no longer use the house for free. but she's also telling me that i basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. she has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. she also says it's not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but i still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house i could stay there any time i want.  she's my older sister and i've always been impressionable to the things she says to me and i'm feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. am i the asshole here?",3
"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public. 

amy isn't a child, and pointing out the truth is not humiliation.",3
"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3
"for being upset because my son didn't talk to me, but talked to my wife.. i'm 40m, my wife is 39f, son in 15. 

yesterday when it was dinner time i called him to come downstairs few times. he didn't answer me so i assumed that he didn't hear me. i went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he'd come downstairs in few minutes. after 15 minutes he still didn't come downstairs so i walked in his room. i knocked first. he was obviously crying. i asked him what was wrong but he didn't answer me so i didn't push him more. 

 i went downstairs and told my wife about it. she went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. she came back and brought him food upstairs. when i asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn't anything important and told me to drop it. i got kind of upset because i want to know what was wrong and i'm his parent as well. 

i haven't been fully ignoring them but i've been acting kinda distant since yesterday. my wife got mad at said that i was acting extremely immature.",3
"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3
"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""they started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. 

this sub isn't ""was this person in the wrong to do this to me"" its ""am i the asshole.""  esh exists. nah exists. ""nta, but you should still apologize/try better next time"" exists. let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.",3
"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3
"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3
"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

tl;dr i thought i had it all but now i just have a lot of eggs.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

i hung up on her. when recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that i was the asshole here for dropping it like that. but i don't think she was ever going to drop it if i didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. so aita?",3
"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem.

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3
"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"for watching got on an airplane?. two days ago, i was on a long-haul flight. i was sitting in an aisle seat. since i haven't seen games of thrones yet, i was looking forward to binge watch the first season. i made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. an hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that i need to turn it off immediately. a little bit confused, i asked why. she told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. while i agree with that, i told her that i'm not going to turn it off. she then basically told me that i am an asshole for not considering other people around me. is she right?

&#x200b;

edit: i want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- i was wearing headphones all the time.

\- it was a flight with swiss from europe to a city in the united states. the in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. however i have to admit that probably none was as bad as got. however, none of these shows was censored as far as i can tell.

\- i'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and i think they switched seats frequently.",3
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update to for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?.  

my original posting: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_disabled\_son\_and\_his\_partner(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita_for_telling_my_disabled_son_and_his_partner)

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

thank you to everyone for telling me i wasn't completely crazy.",3
"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3
"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. 

so, was i the asshole?",3
"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?. first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless. 

asked why they broke up.

the guy was cheating on his wife. he confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. has three kids. all her age or older. she dumped him.",3
"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

"for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.. throwaway, and i will be keeping this is anonymous as i can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with jon's permission i posted all the screenshots on my facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me i have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, i've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that i'm now ruining my sisters life.

"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3
"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3
"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

kids would be cut off. i wouldn't be able to afford any help. they have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. but they'd have to grow up and fast.

would i be the asshole if i do this?",3
"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

was i unfair to this unborn child?  am i a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  she cheated on me, but is this a situation that i should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",3
"for thinking people should stop posting self-congratulatory circle jerks here?. i swear, every day there is a top post about ""for saving kittens from a notorious kitten abuser?"" or ""for breaking up with a convicted rapist?""

these are not conflicts. these are not moral dilemmas. i thirst for juicy conflict where i get to reign down mighty judgement upon the poster. i want to question my own moral standings. i'm tired of the limp dick posts where we're supposed to congratulate the poster on being a hero when it's obvious from the title that, no, you're not an asshole, you're just an attention seeking whore for posting it. 

i'm looking at you:

 **if i break up with my girlfriend for stealing tips when we go out to eat?** are you kidding me? are you an asshole for breaking up with someone who steals from people?

 **for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?** this is literally a crime and you want to know if you're an asshole? 

 **for being upset that my fiancee is staying with her ex** they're banging and you want to know if you're an asshole for being upset. seriously? 

 **for wanting my cousin to pay the same amount of rent as me** unless the body of this post details the fact that you are racking up 3/4 the amount of utilities, run a harem out of the apartment, and piss on their clothes, then no, you're not an asshole for expecting them to pay their equal share.

"for laughing my ass off at my wife's expense?. just for context, i am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. she is insecure about her height and while i try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she doesn't like about herself.

with this in mind, we recently went to one of my favorite places to eat. now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. 
we ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

"for filling a few faux amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?. this has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. there are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... i have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. the first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a bluetooth speaker.  amazon replaced all my packages and i would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so i decided to fill a few packages with chihuahua shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. i also taped notes that said "" dear children, stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. or am i a diabolical genius?",3
"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3
"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

thanks again.",3
"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3
"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3
"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3
"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3
"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

so this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",3
"for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?. my former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. as a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so i was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. she (now laura) has not started hrt yet but is living fulltime as a woman. laura and i no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3
"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3
"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3
"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3
"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?. my wife has minor anxiety and ocd. she has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. none of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. it was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. she had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn't want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn't. i talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn't want to do it.

after the delivery, i was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. a lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. my wife said she wasn't going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. she said she just kept saying ""i don't want to,"" but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. i came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.

things got considerably better when we left the hospital. my wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. this was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.

the conflict comes in because i told my dad he couldn't be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. i've also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. a number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we're using and so on. i stopped sending photos, but my wife and i talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.

so i told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can't come meet the baby. they probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife's parents, her sister, and my mom.

a lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. my mom told me i should give them a chance, but i think the risk is too big. am i the asshole for banning them?",3
"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i told cliff what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said ""don't concern yourself with what they say. they're childish"". so i dunno...aita?",3
"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3
"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.. so right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because i won't give up my appointed time with them. my son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200b;

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200b;

i'm so pissed right now. am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during my time with my kids? how is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",3
"for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last name?. my teacher doesn't like my first name and always talks about how weird it is, and how my last name should be my first. so she took it upon herself to only refer to me by my last name, on tests she'd even cross out my first name when i wrote it. i kept telling her i preferred being called by my first name, but she laughed it off. so i started calling her by her first name, the first time she was shocked but after a month she just kept yelling to me how i was being really disrespectful. i've gotten numerous detentions because of it, but i don't want to stop until she calls me my first name. so if i keep calling her by her first name.

edit for more information: i have an arabic name and live in a country where majority of people are arabs. i should also clarify that in my country we already call teachers by their first name (ex: mrs. name) however i stopped addressing the mrs and only call her by her name. the country i live in isn't very well, and school systems are upside which is why it may be different then everyone else's.",3
"for telling my mom she's a whore?. throwaway. long time lurker, first time posting. 

i am the oldest daughter of 4 children. i'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

when i was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. i, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

this has put a strain on my mothers and i's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
she didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, i remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and i'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. as a kid i didn't understand, but as i got older i realized what she was doing in front of us and i feel sick. 

people ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". they split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

i've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. this was roughly 3 years ago. 

my mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. they exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. i read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old co worker. but i know my mother, and i know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. i mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

my new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

she asked me what i thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. she asked for my honest opinion about the matter and i told her; 

""to be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

she cried, said she couldn't believe i just called her a whore and left my house. we haven't spoken for a few days.

today, i got a call from my siblings saying i hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. i disagree, i had to witness my mom cheating on my father, i watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. she asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? sorry i'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",3
"for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?. when my wife \32f\ and i \32m\ got married eighht years ago, she made about 15k more per year than i did. our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. my wife was the one who insisted on this, and although i was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), i agreed since she felt strongly about it.

&#x200b;

a few years after we married i decided to go to law school. long story short, i ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. since i managed not to go into debt, i have a good bit of money left over after i make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200b;

my wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that i get to buy most of the things i want while she is on a much more limited budget), and i told her i would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. i think fair is fair since this was her idea, but i do wonder if  i am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

"for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?. so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.

my boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

for an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

a few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

so last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

he doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

i've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.


edit:  so i posted this before i left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  i certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.

though i haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, i'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  whether you think i'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and i appreciate that.",3
"for telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?. heya. 

so this happened a few days ago, and i'm still pretty worried about whether i'm an asshole or not. 

i take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. background: 

 i have epilepsy. i have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so i have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. to accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, i sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

now onto the story: 

i'm on the bus ride home, and i found a seat in the disability section. i was about 2 stops from my home, and  i was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. the next thing i know, i see a flash. 

i look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. i was in a bit of a rough state, so i asked him to delete it. i was probably firmer than i usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and i had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

the man was stuttering and saying things like ""i just wanted a picture he was being so cute and i saw his id badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" i asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

i told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

i was then at my stop and ran home.

i felt bad, because i do epilepsy activism work so i felt for him but i was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

should i have just let him keep the picture? aita?

edit to clear up some things: 

-i dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-i'm a female :) 
-i live in canada
-while i dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-if he had asked me, i would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. hes super cute so i get it.

"for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend's aunt in front of everyone?. i know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
i'm a native french speaker from canada, but i have a very pronounced ""acadian/chiac"" accent. for those who don't know, it's pretty much a mix of french and english with some local dialect thrown in there. pretty common in the maritimes, where i still live. i'm perfectly bilingual in both languages.

i started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks english, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they've all been really great, except for one of his aunts. she says she was a french teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in france, and she insists on only talking to me in french. i agreed at first since i didn't want to be rude to his family but it's getting super weird. i don't understand how she was able to teach kids english or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like i have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope i'm right because it makes absolutely no sense. (example: she said ""a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche"" which roughly translates to ""to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth"" when she meant ""this pumpkin pie tastes delicious"") 
she constantly criticizes my ""accent"".  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me i need to ""pick a language"" when i accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper ""français standard"" is actually getting harder for me since i've been only studying/working in english). 

so last night during dinner she started going on about how acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total bs, and obviously weirdly directed at me. for the rest of the night i stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like i didn't understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. i wasn't trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the french and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
turns out she was super pissed and told everyone i was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. looking back i think i might've taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and i feel bad. my boyfriend said i was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. here?


edit: forgot to mention that i told her a few years ago that it's hard for me to fully speak proper french as i spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain acadian culture (she wasn't having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",3
"if i record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?. my neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the tv. i've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. we have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. they also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. it's actually turning me off sex. i find them insufferable. 

 as petty revenge, i'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. i feel they know i'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since i'm not a tough guy or something (i'm a young woman), they don't care. 

i'm in australia, and i'm pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

"for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?. my daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. she has been begging for a nintendo switch. due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a switch. money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. i just don't feel now is the right time for a switch.

the theft: 

on easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. aunt & uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. she lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. well, cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. she eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

my kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. she snuck it out of aunt & uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. she proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when aunt & uncle called & asked if we had seen where cousin might have left it.

due to cousin's challenges, she was utterly distraught over her missing gameboy. it's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

i'm disappointed about the thievery, but i'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. i only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. it wasn't until i sat there & thought about it that i knew she was lying to me. once i told her i knew it had to be her because of xyz did she finally confess. her behavior only got worse from there. she refused to apologize when uncle & cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like she was the one being wronged. 

i feel like i need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing is not ok. i think that purchasing the switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

i mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... birthday... i don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. what do you think reddit?

edit: thank you all for the replies. i just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

also - i do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. not sure how or when, since i have a so to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***edit: i'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying i'm ta for being a lazy parent. our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and i. my husband and i are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. he and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. i assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",3
"update - for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. a few months ago, i posted this post( https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if i was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. it blew up. it ended up on twitter. people shared it to facebook.

the general consensus was, yes, that i am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. a couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. more than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

well.

after i posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. she started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""do you seriously fucking think that i *actually like* eating at olive garden?""

guys, she saw the post. she was *furious*. 

she doesn't like olive garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. i was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's latino, do i ever see her make pasta? no. a meal isn't complete without rice. you don't know me at all.""

she yelled about olive garden for a solid twenty minutes. it wasn't just about olive garden, but it was a lot about olive garden.

long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. she ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 so, yeah.

tl;dr: i ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. i didn't take her out on dates and i didn't pay enough attention. i would do anything to fix everything.

edit: to clarify a few things

1. i didn't post on april first.

2. i say that she yelled about ""mostly olive garden"" because she did. she was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over olive garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. she did not call herself latino. she calls herself latinx, but i thought latino would be less confusing. guess it just made me look like a dick.",3
"for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?. my lovely girlfriend and i have been together for 8 months. she slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

my issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student id to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

i asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my id on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. i told her that i didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. we started to fight about it and i ended up asking her to leave.

since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. when i told my roommate about this he said that i was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and i yelled at her about it. i think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. aita?

edit: i thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, i get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

edit: i'm at work now obsessing but i know that i screwed up. i had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess i'm projecting or something. and no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money i tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. i brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. we had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  she chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

also, i am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",3
"for telling my roommate that guys who go to porn conventions are losers?. i (26m) and roommates with (30m). let's call him mark. mark told me that he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was to laugh. he asked why i laughed so i just explained.

i said that i can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women looking to further their career. but the dudes who go as fans that aren't in the industry are just weirdos and losers. i've seen videos/pics and they look just as you'd expect them to.

"lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging. asking for blunt honesty here because i can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if i've been an asshole and if so i'll go and apologise. 

i'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). my mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. in particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

this women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. they have a long long history of bad blood between each other. both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. obviously i think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

anyway even though i really dislike this women, i have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. she's my father's wife and 2. she was close friends with my mom. my wife was livid at finding out about this and insists i put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

so for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. i keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. i try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and i wont hold it against her. she refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

so a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and i lose my tempter. i tell her (paraphrasing)

""just shut up already. you don't get a day in this. you don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for christs sake. just leave me alone already.""

i did not say it calmly. i yelled it and was definitely angry because i'm busy organising my mother's funeral. she has gone off crying and i'm left wondering if i went too far.

i can't deal with this nonsense and i'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",3
"for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a japanese downpour?. my friends and i went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

we're from england, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in japan. it is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. i warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. they were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

i warned them multiple times that if it rains, i would not let them borrow my umbrella.

one friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. i reminded them that i would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

roughly an hour later, it started raining. hard. it was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. i stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). when we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. neither were particularly happy.

for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?",3
"for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? my family is derisively calling me ""scott's tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.. edit: for all the people asking, scott's tots is an episode of the the office, the plot is michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. he assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. the episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. i've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of tv ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. i've watched the office 8 times and i skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. parks n' rec is a better show though...fight me. 

so how do i begin with this. i am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. my grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who i call niece because i truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. the condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise i would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. the stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (i really hope this is making sense). basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do i get to keep it long term. 

my cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to university of arizona so she can start next week. either they didn't know or didn't care about the gpa requirement because when i asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. i don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 gpa. i asked her how she got into uofa and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

i basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my grandma's will and that i will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

that's when all hell broke loose. my mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. my sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that i'm running my own version of ""scott's tots"" because i taking away money that was promised for education. there's also an undertone that i'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so i can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

no amount of explanation is helping. i've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can i keep their shares. if they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. no one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and i imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

there is really nothing stopping me from doing it. i write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what i'm doing. 

i have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the scott's tots thing because i don't want to be seen like that. 

would i be the asshole if i withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

edit: just for my own notes since i'm saving this thread and i guess if might help other people be clear.

cousin a (nieces mom), 38: paid.

cousin/sister  j, 32: paid.

me: paid 

cousin b, 25: not paid.

cousin j2, 20: in school.

niece k, 18: not paid (subject of post).

"update: for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. og post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

it's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and i guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

in my last post, i stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. at this point, i would like to clarify that my family and i are chinese and it is common in chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. however, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. his business was a passion project on the side. my dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. despite the chain of advice i sent her, she ignored me still. i regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. i was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then i received a call from my parents!!! according to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. she had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. my mom was very tearful as well. they scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and i believe she went in the next day.

i had no idea what made her finally break and return home so i texted her (first, i told her i was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. at first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. lmao. what a fucking asshole. glad my sister finally returned to her senses. she told me she broke it off with him and i sincerely hope that's the truth.

this past monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. according to my mom, she was begging that they do is asap, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

the future seems pretty bright right now for her. my parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and i think it'd be great for her). she's officially starting next monday. i'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

tl;dr: sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and mcdonald's. sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

edit: forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. i urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",3
"for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?. backstory:

i failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. i barely passed my second one last month.i noticed i scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn't quite what i expected it to be. (that's ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high b)

side note: the class is about 60 people. unbeknownst to me, it fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is 'easy'. i didn't know this. the class just fit my schedule and i certainly didn't think it was 'easy' after those 2 exams.

here's the catch: our professor is old and i noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. i heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score a's and b's. (we can't really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). our tests are long -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

exam day:

i was extremely irritated when i heard this. this rage really fueled me and i over-prepared for test 3. i studied like crazy  for it because i felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. i was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. i didn't know everything, but i felt pretty great about what i turned in.  i was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as i wrapped it up. 

once i finished and began walking out, i looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. i was so angry and so distraught, that i used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. of course they had. i had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  i answered all of them incorrectly, though i made the process look somewhat legitimate. i realized that if i answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn't answer them in the given time (i was right). 

present day:

i scored a high b, and the curve put my grade at an a. 

i had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

most students failed, even though i found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. i looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. we always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. i saw that a lot of them (i'd estimate about 13-15 students based on what i saw ) used the ""fake"" methods i had used on those incorrect answers.  more students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that i'd screwed some of the cheating students. 

i honestly can't say i feel bad about what i did. i worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my gpa and my future. 

edit: 
a common argument i see here is ""see you studied and did better! just keep doing that!"" 
i studied like a maniac. i didn't go out, didn't attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. it's a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because i didn't have much going on in my other classes.",3
"for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? they've just found out and are acting like i've betrayed them.. my children are 17 and 14 respectively, and i'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

my husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. no one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

i had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. it was at an aa meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the us. 

i have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. i like to joke that i'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. i've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- i am so damaged that i just feel lucky that i got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

we had two children- two sons. we'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
he has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

my mother in law told the kids this sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. she didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

my 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. i broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing i'd ever heard him say. i asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

he told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and i feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. i am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and i don't know how to proceed. i have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",3
"for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?. so i'm 17 and i used to be morbidly obese. i was actually morbidly obese until last year when i decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. i'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and i feel really great. i went from 130kg to 70kg and i'm 5ft 9

anyways my sister eats horribly. she is morbidly obese. my parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

anyways i saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. the sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. my mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. it's absolutely insane i think and there was nice coke can to go with it. i told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. i offered her a piece of tofu in which i was having for lunch. tofu is actually delicious. more people should try it.

 she told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that i'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when i was a child(i wish someone did). apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. my mother said i wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

"for not shaving my legs for work?. so i'm a 21 year old female. i feel like i should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out i rarely shave my legs. i'm straight, i'm very feminine, and i just don't like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. also i'm not a hairy person at all! you can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. the only time i shave is when i'm dating a new guy in my life and i've been with my current bf for 3 years now. also he doesn't give a rats ass if i shave my legs. 

so i work for a promotion company where i travel and work at event and festivals. but today i had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so i stoped to say hi before i left out. 

when i ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. i said sure and came in and he shut the door. he was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. i was in literal shock. i was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. my boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained i didn't shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that i wasn't being hygienic. i was even more shocked. 

i told him i didn't understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. i asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. i then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this i'd prefer hr to be there and he just told me that we didn't need to discuss it any further. 

later today i just got an email from hr saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. i'm freaking out and it's making me so anxious.
for not shaving my legs for my job?

edit: so people giving my boss hate i understand but i'm not mad at him and don't blame him. im not sure but i feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn't even force dress code and stuff. but also i really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since i've worked there 8 months with no incident.",3
"for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother. my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. he'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if i tell him to. even then, unless i'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why i can't just do it instead. on top of that, he only holds her if i hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. he stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so i have to get up with her. we've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that i've told him i can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

i'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. i put the baby in his gaming room and told him i was going out. in reality, i just went to the gas station because i felt like i couldn't trust him, and sure enough when i got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. i took a ~10 second video of this and after i comforted the baby, i sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

she called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" i'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but for sending the video?

"for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?. i've known james since we were 11. he's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike and even share a last name. he lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

i had a crush on him growing up and i asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. he always declined and said we were just best friends. he's really goofy with me, and treats me like i'm his little sister and over time i came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. my parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

a couple months ago i had a ons and found out i was pregnant. being as i have pcos i am over the moon because i was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. i am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and i cant explain how many tears of relief i shed. i've always wanted to be a mom and finally i have a chance at this. i have my own home, have savings, i'm in the right place in life and i'm so happy. 

when james found out he was also over the moon. he thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

my mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one i cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. he confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. he said 'i know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

i found that so demeaning and hurtful, and i burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to gtfo. he apologized and left and i haven't heard from him since. i'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! i want to reach out but i just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and i'm not sure if i'm the one that's being difficult or if it's him.",3
"for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?. a very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i've never objected to people crossing our land as i'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

it made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

they were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. 

they had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",3
"for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?. let me preface this by saying that i (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. i've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. this is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. i'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

now, i've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. her beds bigger for starters and i cant cook at home because it's always congested, so liv and i cook a meal twice a week at hers. she has a roommate who we'll call (bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. i've tried my best to get to know bianca but it's not reciprocated and i can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. she's never asked a question about what i do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

liv told me that bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. i hate being the cause of her discomfort. whenever i'm at livs house, i don't use the living room and go straight to livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). besides cooking with liv, i'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

here's where liv and i may have screwed up. we were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). all of a sudden bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
we both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

their relationships gone down the gutters since i came along and i can't help but feel responsible. 

on an end note, liv and i want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

my mates telling me i'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and i should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. but i see it as the next step before moving in together, that i'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. so aita?",3
"for yelling at my sister in law?. context here: i'm an ex heroin addict. the why and how isn't important, but i got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. i'm 26 now and completely clean. i don't even drink, except for on special occasions where i'll have two or three drinks at most.

now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before i had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that i'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. the first year or so, i understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. however, it's been almost six years since i was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that i'm gonna stay clean.

she's very vocal about these concerns, too. if i get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks i've relapsed again and i'm having withdrawals. she made a huge scene on christmas day two years ago because i had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that i must have been doing a ton of coke. if anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. i mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

i went away recently with some friends. on the first day of my trip, i dropped and broke my phone. because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced i had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. when i got home, i found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. it was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and i sort of flipped at my sister in law. i yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that i'm incapable of staying clean. she got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but i said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. at that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. i'm being told left and right that i'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and i need to apologise, but i'm still upset that she evidently believes i'm incapable of doing this. aita?",3
"for making fun of my boyfriend's penis. upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). in the privacy our relationship, i playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. however, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

so the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. one of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and i write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". they were all read aloud and when its revealed that i wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. my boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

after we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. he said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. he said that by making that joke, all i have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. he wasn't mad, just disappointed. he said that he would never make fun of me if i had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me i was beautiful no matter what. 

i felt really, really bad when he said that. i have apologized and things are fine now but i think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? am i the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",3
"for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip. ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which i pay for by myself, as i make enough money to afford it and i didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
we also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

the fact that i pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course i pay in part for). also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother a lot about our lives and future plans.

anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. however, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across south america which she was going to go on on friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

first i asked if i could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when i asked why hadn't she told me she said because i wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (which is mostly true)

well an argument ensued and at some point i finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

gf: ""why can't i just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

i believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus i was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

that night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am i really an asshole for this?

tldr: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, i kicked her out my house.

"for completely ignoring my father's girlfriend. it's more like ""are we the assholes?""

i have a twin (we're 16,m). we have identical faces, but you can't mix us up. i have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. he's bigger, like he works out. no one mixes us up. 

we have known her for 2 years. she mixes our names up all the time. at least 3 times a day. we know she's doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

so. yesterday i was in living room and she called me my twin's name. i just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. then she called me my name and i answered her normally. my brother did the same, we did it few times. now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",3
"for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though i'm not religious?. i'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

i have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. i would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

they get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

i used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work i do. she couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

even though i'm a known atheist i decided i too wanted some time to meditate everyday. i told my manager i needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. she initially said no, and then i got a hastily written email saying of course i was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. she'd obviously checked with hr and covered her ass. 

for the last six months i've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. this has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

i recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that i was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. i told her i'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",3
"for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?. so last weekend i went on a tinder date with a girl who i've been chatting to for a while. it was our second date and i thought things were going pretty well.

we end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which i recommended. it was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. i awkwardly try to join in but i'm basically ignored. i leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. they're still chatting. i stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. they back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

at this point i go out and grab a smoke. she comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn't seen this guy in ages. i tell her that's cool but i'm just gonna head home soon. she asks me to wait for her bc she doesn't have a ride and it's far from home. 

so i wait bc whatever, night is ruined and i might as well just hang out. i wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her i'm going home and she can either come with me or stay. i see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. i try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. i gesture to her that i'm going and she holds up a finger like ""wait a minute"" and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

i've had it at this point and i just text her ""leaving now, bye"" and head straight to my car and leaves. i get frantic calls about 15 min later. she asks me where i am and if i could go back and pick her up since she doesn't have a ride and her friend doesn't live close to her like i do. i say ""no"" and hang up. 

anyways the next day i get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. she's upset because i left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can't get uber/lyft for some reason. she calls me a pos and to never call her again and that she'll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

"for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?. first of all, i know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

my girlfriend and i were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. we are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. we are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. the same home. because our parents are married.

it's my mom and her dad. both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. when we were in hs we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and i being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

honestly, i hate being in this situation. even though i know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". i think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. my (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""what did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" but i see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. my girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. we can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

this living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. i love this girl and have spent my life with her. i want to spend the rest of my life with her. i just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

"for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?. i found out i was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. when i told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if i had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. i was already living independently, both my boyfriend and i worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. in our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so i thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

during my pregnancy i asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when i started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when i wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when i was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. they refused, telling me that i was expecting to be catered to. they also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that i was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that i was making dumb decisions"". when i spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that i was trying to get gifts from them. i had severe post-partum depression and thought i was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. my relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. they told me they were afraid i was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

which brings us to today, 3 years later. my sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than i did when i was treated ""as an independent adult"". our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff i have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. i answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. i've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

"update if i don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her tinder pics?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/axpo27/wibta_if_i_dont_go_on_a_second_date_with_a_larger/

hey again everyone. i finally have answers.

i never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now alice and her sister is gabby.

on saturday i got a facebook message from gabby. it boiled down to ""this is stupid, will you meet alice so she can properly explain?"" i try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on sunday i go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

she was cute, my crush was strong, but i managed to sit down with a decent poker face. she pretty much burst into tears the moment i arrived. lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and i really nearly bolted bc i felt so awkward. 

gabby was the one to suggest alice use her pictures. alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on tinder. all of herself... and she was bigger. 

i feel really fucking dumb. still. alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on tinder without scaring everyone off. so that's why gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if i'm being honest, not that i care. never did just thought i was being lied to).

when i sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. i'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. sucks to be all those other guys i guess because i'm taking her out this weekend again. 

i'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but i don't know. maybe i'm being dumb? she's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck i need to calm my crush down. this feels like high school again.

and that's that. just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since i got a good many comments and pms. thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",3
"for getting 3 co-workers fired for making a hot list?. a bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on friday after work. everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). i go to the bathroom, and as i am about to exit the hall to the bathroom i hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. perhaps i shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and i did.

i overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. i was upset and disturbed. i was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. yesterday morning i tell hr and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. all three men were fired first thing this morning, and now i feel terrible.

i hated the way they were talking about women, but i didn't think they should be fired. with that said, we work for a large company that i know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down i suppose i knew it was a possibility when i complained. nobody knows that i am the person who reported them, and i've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". i'm wondering if i should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time i didn't feel comfortable doing that. i especially feel bad because i had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.

aita?

info 1: it was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinks

info 2: a lot of people are insisting that i am upset because i was low on the list. i tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments i feel like i have to address it. i was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; i was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. i hate that i even have to write this

"if i tell my girlfriend she needs to bring her own food to my house and pay for the food she has eaten?. i want to start off by saying i love my girlfriend and i'm scared that if i give her this rule or expectation it will make her feel unwelcome at my home. we have been dating for awhile now and she's always been courteous in asking to eat or use my stuff, she doesn't eat much so i always gave her the okay. after she had spent a week at my place i told her she doesn't have to ask me to eat my food on day 3 since she would always ask before she ate, she doesn't eat much since she's smaller but i didn't take into account that a handful of granola, a bowl of yogurt, and a banana every day would stack up after awhile. she left my place after the stay and now every time she comes and stays for a period of time she eats my food. i feel bad for wanting her to start buying her own groceries to keep at my place since she consistently takes me out for food, buys me clothes, contributes to groceries when we cook, and keeps my weed supply full. i can't comfortably afford to be feeding one and a half me's so often though since she's here at minimum 2 days a week. she has brought up in the past the fact that she feels i don't take her out enough but we have a quiet understanding that she makes more than me since she works 5-6 days a week and i work 3 (not by my choice). i feel like she contributes a lot monetarily to the relationship and in terms makes her feel like she contributes more emotionally in the relationship because she's always making sure i'm taken care of and comfortable. i don't know if i should just suck it up because she's not taking much from me and if i'd be wrong or an asshole to expect someone who gives so much to give me more. wibta?

edit: wow. i think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. my gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and joycemanner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. all within 20 minutes of making this post! she thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

edit2: to answer some repeated questions: i made this as a throwaway account. the account name is based off a pretty popular band (joyce manor) i like so, i didn't think she would realize it was me. i'm 26 and she's 20. her name is not joyce. i don't think she'll come on here to give her side of the story.

"for wanting a sunrise wedding?. every year on our anniversary, my fiance and i wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. it's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

we decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). after that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from canada, but that's unavoidable.

based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

i was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) ""hey i know you're going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you're really growing up. i think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.""

she said ""i smell?"" and i said ""yah, just a little. no big deal. just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some."" 

her parents called and were furious saying she's going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare i make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. 

i said ""sorry, i thought if roles were reversed i'd want someone to tell me. are you really saying you didn't notice her smelling like bo all the time?"" 

they said she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would make her insecure. and by circumventing her psychological timeline i've given her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond.

so from my perspective i really can't see what i did wrong here. from asking her out until receiving the check, i intended to pay. after she offered to pay, i thanked her and allowed her to pay.

the next day i woke up to angry texts. she said i put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. i asked what she wanted me to do differently. apparently i should have argued/insisted that i would pay. my friends agree with her. now i'm wondering if i should just apologize and pay her back.

"for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?. throwaway for obvious reasons. basically i m42 got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. i got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""andy, sara, kate"". i had these tattoos all done at once after kate was born knowing she would be my last. my oldest child andyt22 came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. my wifef41 immediately supported her and made sure that i would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. it was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. i'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to athena. 

the problem arose yesterday when my wife and athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. the tattoo going down my arm still reads ""andy"" and not ""athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. my wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but i explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""andy"" to ""athena"". i told her i would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which i can not afford either of. i explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that i don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if i don't support who she is, i just need to leave her life. my wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if i don't ""get my act together"". i personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

i'm determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that i should have achieved had mia not wasted five years of my life. but there's an issue that has me on the fence: i was supposed to donate my kidney to mia's brother tom, and now i don't know if i should do it.

tom has esrd and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. i'm not that close to him and i was only going to do it because i wanted to help mia's family in any way i could because i though they were going to be m family. but now that i know that she was just playing me the whole time, i'm having second thoughts. organ donation is a big deal, i will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point i don't want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

"for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?. i (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. we met on instagram, i followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. i thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. she makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

however, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. she has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. as soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

this really annoyed me, i get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. she just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. i just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

on the way home, i told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". i told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks i'm an asshole.

"for being a ""karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?. my car was shaking when i braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and i believed him but the deal i got the car from has free diagnostic so i took it there. 

so my dad was right, it was the rotors. my friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. so the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). i said ok. 

he calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. i asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. i specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

he calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so i needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. i said i told you not to cut those and he was like ""i was just tryna to help you out""


i'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. it's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). i pay and leave. my car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. i bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. we get into and he's like i'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. i tell him i'll get a lawyer cause i'm not giving him literally another penny, i paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


i ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


i told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said i was a ""karen""

i am getting married in a few months. we have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so i thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. my future wife and both of our families are roman catholic. catholic ceremonies are *long*. i'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. if you are not a believer, it is boring af. hell, im catholic and i know i'll be bored for 80% of it. i thought i'll spare them the trouble.

anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying i forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. so i said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. she got confused, i explained and she got annoyed to say the least. said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. i tried to explain again & fix things but i felt guilty the whole time. 

was it an asshole move?


edit: ah, i suppose i am ta. just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. no hard feelings between us. 

- those who i decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to christenings, first communions & confirmations) so i thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",3
"for being upset my mil won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?. my mil has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). the quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. i was really looking forward to getting ours because i admit i'm a bit of a hipster and i love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

she recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and i thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. i asked my sil (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. i was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. turns out mil has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

i message her directly about it because i'm just that kind of person. i like hearing it straight from the other guy. mil says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. i ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though i know it's a lie. i push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

i ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. i tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""i'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. i hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

but now i got a really mean voice message from my sil telling me that i crossed the line and am acting like a huge b\*tch for no reason. i'm shocked because i have a great relationship with my sil and she always defended me from other family bullshit. my husband wants no part in this now. for what i said to my mil?",3
"for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?. my ex (24f) and i (24m) dated 5 years ago. we were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. she and i shared the same circle of friends so i continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and i distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. i'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. i'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but i no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

this past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. i have a new girlfriend (23f) that i have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. i never thought i could feel this way about someone). i invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

at the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. she came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. i was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. she then says to my girlfriend, ""hey did you know me and ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""yes, i'm aware"". ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. my gf said ""wow, i'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. i was angry, i truly don't believe i ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes i do find her more attractive than my ex. i told my ex ""i'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

she went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them i called her uglier than my current gf. i told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me i could have been a little bit less harsh. ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. am i the asshole?",3
"forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room. this has been an ongoing argument between my wife and i, but it resulted in a huge argument today and i'm starting to wonder if i'm in the wrong. i think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. i'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that i'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

so my wife and i have two kids together. but before i met my wife i had a daughter with my now ex-wife. my daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. we haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and i have no desire to speak with her anyway.

i still own the same house as then and i've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. at first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? i can't really explain the logic behind it because i don't think there is any. it just doesn't feel right to change her room.

this has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and i have really had. the house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. my kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. occasionally i will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. it's therapeutic in some weird way.

my wife has always wanted to change the room. at first it was because she wanted a study, but i refused and eventually she gave up. 

we're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. again i put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 she really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. she was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. she was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. she said a lot of things but i think that basically sums it up.

when she said these things i was really hurt. but i've had a few hours to think it over, and i think i might be the unreasonable asshole here. it's not fair to make my kids share a room because i won't let go of the past. it's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

"for singling someone out at a comedy show?. i do stand up. i also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

i mentioned at work that i couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on saturday because i had a show. my coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

i had no problem helping him out and i knew this club wouldn't care if i slid a couple people in. but i've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places i usually get to perform at so i told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

i'm up there doing my show and i see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. it bugs me a little but i didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. then i see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

so i start telling a joke about a time i gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as i'm doing it i'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes i'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until i'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

it killed, so that was the good part. but when i showed up to work i was expecting an apology from him. instead he was expecting an apology from me for (i'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

he basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

i think, without question, that he's the asshole. but he doesn't believe me and the only people i could tell this story to and ask to confirm i'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

who's the asshole?

"- mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage. i'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. so i'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

i've been married to my current wife for three years. we dated for 2 years before getting married. before meeting my current wife i had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

my late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. it was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and i didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. i never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

i've always had a momento from my previous marriage. it was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. she gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. before meeting my current wife i would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

when i met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. so i started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. for a time she accepted that until recently.

over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding i get rid of it. i can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but i had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... why can't she accept it's very important to me?

long story short, when i was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. when i found out i broke down because it was literally the last thing i had to remember my late wife.

 i don't know. maybe i am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. aita?

"for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?. first up, i love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. i'm a big dude, i'm 6'4 and i'm always goddamned hungry. i'm a firefighter so i'm always on my feet and simply put, i just love foooooood. my wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will always help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it's just the right amount of food that i want to eat but she'll go ahead and take some. 

i've asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she'll get really defensive and say 'it's just a little babe, you'll be fine!' except i'm not fine, i'm hungry. and then when i'm hungry i get hangry and i snap at everyone cuz i'm goddamned hungry!

things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so i gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst i held the goddamn plate and then when i went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

lately my mil gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can't stand spicy food.  i tried that yesterday, i ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. she said no. i went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn't eat it.

i told her i had to take drastic measures because i'm fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole.

"for telling my mom she's the reason i don't want any kids?. i (23f) am the oldest of 4 siblings. my dad passed away when i was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

there's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. so when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. if i had to guess i'd say i spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. plus an hour or so on chores. 

now i love my siblings, and i love my mom. but from when i was 14 till i moved out at 19 i had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. all there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

i'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. i've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. i've politely told her i don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

when she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after i told her to stop asking) i told her ""giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" i didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

she cried. i told her i don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. i didn't apologise. 

aita?

edit: when i said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" i wasn't trying to be malicious. 
a) she at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why i had to. 
b) i called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, i had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

i wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why i said it that way.

edit 2: yes, i'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. i was there. i never said i don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. i'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and i don't want kids because of that.

edit 3: for the people pming and commenting about how it's my fault i didn't have friends and not my mom's: i wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

last edit: for everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

actually the last edit: my mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean i only watched the kids till 06:30. i usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",3
"for laughing at a guy throwing dollars on my girlfriend at a club?. my gf and i were out at a club to see a dj. we were dancing, drinking, having a good time. my gf has been doing yoga for a few years and when she's especially sauced she likes to throw in some splits and stuff on the dance floor. well, we got sauced and as she's doing her 3rd split or so a guy comes up and ""makes it rain"" on her - literally like 4 dollars. obviously he was making a joke that she was dancing like a stripper. whatever. this happened and in the moment i just fucking started laughing. i thought it was legitimately funny in the moment. my girlfriend gets up and says ""we're fucking leaving"" and basically storms out. get outside and she's basically telling me that i should've punched the dude out or something and that he made her feel like a whore and i'm an asshole for laughing. i'm fucking 31, i'm not punching anyone out at a bar unless they're actually getting physical or threatening to get physical. while i agree that it might've been somewhat demeaning, i also think it was objectively funny. aita?",3
"update: for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

so a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

she texted me asking if i was looking to buy a new bed and i said yes without thinking much of it. she then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

we sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and i apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

she said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. i told her this isn't necessary and that i would deal with it but she insisted. 

i've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. the new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. she switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. a lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


thanks to everyone who pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

i tried to emphasize this as much as i could in the comments but seriously my wife and i never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on saturday and it's been going well. feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

but yeah, everything's fine now. to be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. i barely remember but i think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

seriously i love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. she's honestly a really good person!

i made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so i remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

thanks everyone :)

for telling my british neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?. i saw s similar post which inspire me this. i'm albanian and i live in guangzhou china. i live in an apartment building that's filled wit mostly chinese people and one british couple. they've been here 3 years longer than i have and can't say anything other than nihao and xiexie. they constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which i told them to stop and start learning chinese. i taught myself to be half fluent in chinese before i got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months i've been here. they managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic english but they left. i told them that they've been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. i told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying i'm an asshole and i'm making their lives difficult. i told them i'll start speaking to them in chinese and albanian from now on,3
"for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?. i'm 26m, my sister is 28f. we're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. i'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. despite all of this, we're not particularly close. we live in the same city but i might see her once a year in passing.

to make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. she said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and i was the only person who could help. i couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. she took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. she left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

it took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. he was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. they took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. i have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. i can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

i'm just not equipped to handle a kid. my home isn't child proof, i have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. i work full time, i'm in school. i couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. i feel like i let my sister down but first and foremost i believe she let her own child down. i don't know what's going to happen.

was i the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, i wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. never mind i don't even have a car. i'll admit i could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

child services is what its name implies, here where i live it's called facs. they work with families in struggling times like this. i told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. they left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because i'm not the parent. even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

i didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. i contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. my best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. i don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

and i can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one i contacted can offload the work for me. it's been 8 days and no word on anything: if i took eight days off work with no telling when i could return, i might as well not return.",3

"for not accommodating a vegan guest?. longtime lurker here. hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

so my wife (29f) and i (29m) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. we like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. we have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

our friend james started dating his girlfriend sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that sarah was vegan. i thanked james for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. he agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. everything was fine, until now.

during our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. my wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

however, after the meal, james took us aside privately and told us that sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. he added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

my wife feels terrible that sarah was so upset and apologized to her and james profusely, but i don't agree that we did anything wrong. i like sarah very much as a person and i don't have anything against her dietary choices, but i don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. for the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. aita?",3
"for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?. lots and lots of ugly background here but i'll try not to wander. my wife i have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in may. i have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

on monday i came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. i asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. they said they were playing army and since i've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, i knew their parents wouldn't mind either. so i told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case i needed him to come down. i was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. so they did this every day this week until thursday when my daughter came home from her cit job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if i was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. i climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where i assume the girl had usually sat. i told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

this morning i got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son saturday morning. we sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. i tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and i've gotten them to stop. my wife asked if i planned on punishing him, i said that i don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. my neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. i told her that was really overkill. my wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and i asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. my wife has texted me that i am being incredibly irresponsible and if i don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. in all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

"update for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. original thread(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/)

my wife went yesterday to collect our winnings and they shorted her $500. my wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. they gave the rest to jessica. they made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and i. this was all bogus.

we made a post on our community facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. i guess jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. they found it condescending to give jessica a prize just for having asd. it was a joint decision between jessica and her parents.

we talked a bit and learned jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an asperger's syndrome organization. she's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as asd/ass and hopefully win, of course. we didn't know any of this at all, and i guess this is why the organizers wanted good pr.

my wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. she's going to help out where she can or if jessica needs assistance. things like editing, photography, etc. i guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

ps: here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/em15ywu/)'s the recipe i used, a lot of people asked for it in the previous thread. here(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bjai4e/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a/em7gekx/) it is rewritten to be less ambiguous/more info.

pps: yes, i know ""mentally handicapped"" isn't the right verbiage. i've learned a lot about asd in the last few days. i only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. autism and asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, i should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",3
"for removing my birth control without consulting my husband first. sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying i'm not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent 


i went to the doctor yesterday because i've been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like ""we gotta get this implant out of you"" (i had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and i decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because i don't want to conceive.


i call my husband and tell him and he's like ""oh ok did you get on the pill?"" and i said no, i didn't want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said i need to be on birth control because it's the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced i'm like trying to get pregnant without his consent. should i have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

eta: if i hadn't of taken it out yesterday, i would have to wait a month because that was my gynos my next available appointment. so it wasn't that i didn't want to consult my husband, it was kind of a quick decision.


eta #2: i have a fucked up cervix so i can't have an iud, can't use tampons, lots of stuff.


eta #3: i believe now he is the asshole; it's not normal for a husband to react this way, and he kinda sucks anyway. thank you for the support and the judgement (even the dude who messages me i was basically just a sex doll)",3
"for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?. i know how the title sounds, hear me out. my \26m\ gf \24f\ takes forever in the bathroom. upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. when i playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago i was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. she said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. i told her that i got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that i also do to stay presentable. her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. now she's saying i have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which i find crazy as i'm not her sugar daddy. why should i pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

i understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. i haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am i enforcing any ultimatums. if, as she says, i've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. if we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should i pay? anyone who says i'm ta, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? be honest with yourselves.

**gf's side:** he keeps being a dick about how long i would take in the bathroom, so as he said, i quit things he didn't even realize i was doing. no makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, i have curly frizzy hair so i stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. do i look like a beast? sure. am i a comfy, smug beast? hell yes.

he rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so i obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. i'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that i stopped, i feel like... why do i ever have to do all this shit. it's unfair. and if i have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. i conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. conservatively. he should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. otherwise it's not fair.

**both:** we love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. we recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**edit (from bf):** alright, i'm the asshole. you know, it wasn't even the people saying i *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying i wasn't. no way in hell do i want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think i'm not ta then i definitely am. my girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". jesus. the amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that i'm not ta and the reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

i think it's reasonable to say that i'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case i would either pay up or we break up. however, luckily, i am still very much into her. i would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and i think those who pointed out that i should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. as i said before, this was never a fight. and for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me i can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**edit 2 (from gf):** thank you, reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. he let me shave his legs. he said he feels like a dolphin. i've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (i didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",3
"for taking back the birthday gift i gave my sister?. so, i'm 24m. my little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. i moved an hour and a half away when i was 18 and we 
don't see eachother often, but i make a point to call/text


it was her birthday yesterday and i thought i'd splurge since she's been going through a rough time. she's changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won't talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. i've made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



anyway, i got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called copics. i'm no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who's anybody has them and our parents don't wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they're about 5$ per marker) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. whenever we've texted recently it's been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. she barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. i was excited to give her the gift but the second i opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying ""see! even he knows you should've got them for me!"" which i awkwardly brushed off. everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like ""oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite."" ""a plaid skirt. wow. i'm blessed."" 


i was prepared for an angsty teen, but i soon reached my limit. our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled ""i told you both exactly what i wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit i don't need! fuck this!"" she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



our parents were a lot less well-off when i was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, i accepted them like i was the luckiest kid ever. i would've never swore and yelled but she's been very spoiled.


i talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. they think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. i agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


sister came back to get the markers, but i took them back. i said that she was ungrateful and i wouldn't tolerate it. she started screaming at me but i just left the ""party"" prematurely with the gift in tow.



my whole family is blowing up my phone because i ""ruined her birthday"". in my eyes, i spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. this will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. but my family doesn't want to hear from me until i give it back. considering i've got my entire family shitting on me, i have to wonder if i did make the wrong choice. so, reddit, aita?",3
"for telling my gf she doesn't understand real life?. i'm m23 my gf is f21 and we've been together for about 2 years now. now i come from a very middle class family, dads a blue collar worker and mom has been working since i was a kid as well. my gf's family is filthy rich and even she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (she's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. my car broke down recently and i've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. i told her i'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. she just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. i told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. she got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. her friends also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the exact same way. spoiled rich white girls who go to western (my ontario mans will get this one). i told them to kick rocks.

"for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?. my boyfriend and i have been together for about 2 1/2 years. we live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. we have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. i wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but i do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when i can. bf doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

for reference, i am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. he is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

on sunday i went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. if you're familiar, it's 13er james peak in co. it was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). i had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. suffice to say, i was pretty hungry by dinner time. i made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. when it came time to eat, because of my big day, i grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. we're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

bf got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. he told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. i told him that i'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

he told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. i said that i agreed, but again, i'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. he told me i should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

we've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). so far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. i think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

"for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?. my brother (26/m) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. 

long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a dna test confirming he's the dad, now he pays child support. they share custody. 

i had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. i told him for the first time that it's his fault. he chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. he got mad and said it's not fair because women can abort but men can't, i told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. he called me an asshole, but i was just being honest.

"for not honoring my son's punishment?. update 2: i told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. yes, i told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, i had to crack the whip. let those two eat each other alive. they deserve each other.

update 1: this hilarious. my son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my day. i was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. i can react in so many ways...


his mom and i are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. cordial, but indifferent. our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

we have 50/50. she requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. i agreed even though this ate into my time with him. apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. i won't see him for three weeks. i am not saying not to punish him. 

punish him when he's on their time. 

i have no problems with him when he's with me.

i refused.

i already made plans to make most if the days that i have him and i'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. i don't care much for step-dad anyways. what i do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

also, i don't want to set precedent where i am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


edit: update: my son called him a ""freaking asshole."" my ex calls him the same thing when they fight. her words, not mine. he learned it from her, not me. i don't open share my dislike for her husband. maybe an eyeroll, but i'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son.",3
"for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended. i am a librarian at a prek-12 school. i lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

for any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. a lot. it's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. they don't realize what they're doing. usually i just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but i don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

one day, i was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. he stumbled and grabbed my chest. again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""looks like ms. aitaitaita is letting the boys cop a feel."" i went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out and grabs my boob. i could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and i took him straight to the office. the principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. the suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

i told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. he said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. i pushed back because i think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because i weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. he also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" i pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me i should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

i tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and i felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so i decided to break off the engagement. his friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. aita?

"for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?. throwaway account.  we were at a local restaurant last saturday evening. this is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. there was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  there was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. a beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. there was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

but as i watched i noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who i assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. in fact, i'd guess the 4th girl consumed most of the mom's margarita. i mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. full disclosure that i'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. so i mentioned it to the hostess. a short time later a manager (i assume) came and asked to see the girls' id's. the girl with her own drink produced one. the second girl who had been drinking from mom's drink did not.  i did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. i assume they were asked to do so.

"for 'promoting religion at work'?. i'm a man with a hindu background working in the uk - that is to say i'm not very religious but my family are and if they're doing something related i don't mind joining in. it was a diwali this past weekend which is a pretty major festival in the hindu religion. 

i had a lot of indian sweets left over, and so i decided to bring 2 unopened boxes and leave them in the break room. at the end of our morning briefing, i stood up and said 'hey, it was diwali yesterday and so i brought in these sweets. help yourself and happy diwali!'. 

what was meant to be a nice gesture to ingratiate myself (i only started a fortnight ago) has left me seething after a meeting with hr. apparently, referencing diwali was akin to promoting a religion and therefore inappropriate at work. apparently i'd also given out hindu sweets (this i find ridiculous as they are just indian sweets with no religious connotations).

to me, it's no different from saying happy christmas which i know this company has no issue with, as evidenced by their christmas promotional video i watched in preparation for my interview.

"update: for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=jx7kr9p2&sh=bd95d6aa

so first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! i'm writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because i want people to see my friend isn't actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

i texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don't live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). it turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. like i said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. she's also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. that's why she told me she couldn't pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when i told her over the phone. that's also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren't covered. it turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn't want to tell us that because she's already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law's money. (apparently it's her fiance's family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

that's why her reasons didn't ring true to me as well. she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. she assured me she thinks i look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought i look bad. 

i know people will question how i can believe her, but i've been friends with her for nearly ten years and i give her the benefit of the doubt. we've been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

i'm still side eyeing the plantation wedding but i didn't tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fiance's family i didn't want to pile on. i do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. i went to the plantation's website and they do acknowledge slavery's evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

i did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and i explained why. she was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. she wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn't even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. she's kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times i've had to point out something she said could be hurtful she's always been understanding instead of defensive. 

i decided i'm going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. it'll still be pretty short, so that's okay. she's fine with that too except she was worried i'll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fiance's family. i reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair i've pretty much heard it all. by the time we hung up i felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",3
"for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?. title is pretty self explanatory. but basically over the weekend, i had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. she's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. she gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

her laptop no longer switches on. she's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. i told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. she's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. i really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. aita?

edit: yikes this blew up. a few people have asked for more info. yes, i packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. i supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. my parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. it wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. i gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",3
"if i don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?. 

some background: my grandfather just passed away at the end of january. he was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

this is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

here's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. 


now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. 

this is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
no matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

i can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. 

i do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

but this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. 

basically, if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",3

i've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. i love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. she is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  i will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). one of her big beliefs though is with holidays. she still celebrates holidays with the family (christmas, easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""money"" side of things. we're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

last year in june my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. i was a little hesitant but i agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. all of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. i obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. all of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. she's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. we fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

am i being unfair here?",3
"for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?. my son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  they are both 16.  her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and i pick him up in the evening.  i will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

the mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  it's her house.  most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  he is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .wtf?  and she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  they also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  whatever.

regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   well, today she came over for the first time.   the night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  i am a correctional officer and was working that night, so i wasn't home to take the call.  my son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   i don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  my husband agreed.

thing is, we don't really care.  i was sexually active at a younger age than them.  my son and i have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  he is a lovely boy, and i believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  they have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  anyway, not only did i not check on them constantly, i told him that as long as she was willing, i would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  my husband and i actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and i asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  good friend laughed and agreed.   turns out it wasn't needed.   dad eventually came and picked her up.

i absolutely stand by my opinion that my son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but i am kind of wondering if i should have made that choice for someone else's child.  i kind of feel guilty, but i think her parents are way over the top control freaks.

"for not wanting my kids every weekend?. my ex husband and i share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. we have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like i have the kids friday after school and then he gets them monday after school. i get them back wednesday after school and then he gets them friday after school and then the week flip flops. we've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. i'm a nurse in the or so i schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. my son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if i have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until i'm done. my ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). while they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, i do not want to give up my free weekends. it took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. my ex agreed if there was a weekend trip i wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but i honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. 

i was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. my sister pointed out that if i was still married, then i wouldn't have all the child free time i have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like i do. my mom said she can't believe i'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. my sil seemed to understand where i was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever i was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the nyc shopping trip i had planned for december and my son would happily join me for my saturday morning spin classes. i considered that but my sil loves taking her kids everywhere so i don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. they were really making me feel like an asshole though. aita?",3
"if i don't let my daughter put a lock on her door?. my daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  she says it's to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but i'm not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.

i don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and i'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. i admit that i've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that i see no reason as to why she'd need a lock. 

the way i see it, it's my house and i am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. she's young, and doesn't really know what's she's asking for.

so, if i don't let her get the lock installed?",3
"for choosing my biological child over my foster son?. my husband and i never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. we've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. he's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

the child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. we were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that i was pregnant. it was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and i am now over 40. i had thought i had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. we can't financially have both children. i can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who i am already bonding with. my husband wouldn't think of it either. we have to refuse the adoption. 

unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. am i the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

edit: 

baby:
baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

finances:

we currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. we are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. social services is giving us until january to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. we can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

we don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. it's a catch 22 basically.",3
"for hiding the fact that i inherited over $785k and a nice middle class home from my girlfriend?. throwaway because i have friends who know my reddit username and they browse this sub very often!

so when both my parents died (15 months apart) i received over $785,000 from my father and i inherited a middle class home from my mother. the thing is, i don't want my friends or my current girlfriend about my financial situation because i want to use the money or at least a few thousand dollars towards an emergency fund and save the rest towards my future kids college tuition (if i ever have any). no, i don't have any debt also i want to have the house for personal usage as i currently live in a cozy apartment by myself however, i'm afraid that if anybody found out they would try to use me or get me for my money. i want people to see me for who i am and not because of what i obtained so for hiding my financial situation towards my friends and s/o?",3
"for telling a coworker i was going to ""make a baby"" and name it a name she wants?. this is the dumbest argument i've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.

i have a friend, ""julie"", who has just come back from maternity leave. she and i work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. we were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and julie asks me about when my husband and i are planning on having kids.

i reply ""it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. definitely sooner rather than later""

then another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. her name is ""anna"" and i'll admit that julie and i don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.

anna interrupts us and says ""hubby and i are working on having a baby right now.""

julie says ""that's lovely.""

anna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby ""joseph"".

i say ""that's a lovely name, my father is called joseph.""

anna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, ""don't you go stealing my name now"" and laughs.

i'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. i'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because i know about a dozen josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could ""steal"".

julie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where anna just sort of says something to me about not ""stealing her name"", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. at this stage she's getting on my nerves.

and then anna says right as we're leaving ""promise me you'll wait until after me so i get joseph"", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. julie and i give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and i realise that she's said i should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case i ""steal"" the name joseph.

we all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and julie asks about my plans for tonight. i say, totally deadpan, ""going to make a baby. the name joseph is so rare i'm worried someone is going to steal it if i'm not quick enough"" and julie and i both burst out laughing.

anna is really really offended. cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. julie and i both think it's really funny but i told my sister and she says that while it was funny, i was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. i am now doubting how funny it actually was.

am i ta?

&#x200b;

backstory because people are asking: anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too ""by the book"" and got a bit email-happy with hr early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, ccing in whoever it was about, reporting coworker x for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and coworker y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. we all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for hr. she eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. me, julie, anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed hr in a while. anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. we've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. we're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.

&#x200b;

also i know i could have said ""i'm not naming my child joseph"" and been done with it but first off i'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker i don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that i get pregnant with a boy.",3
"if i back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? best man is my ex fiance who cheated on me and i can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.. jump into the worst week of my life. i was with my ex fiance for 6 years. loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for august. refused a job offer so could move with him for his next air force assignment. monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) i text back she must have wrong number. she says she doesn't. in a moment of brains i pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. i'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

i confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. i consider it for half a second and say no. cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of std tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who i loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

and on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

i've never hated a human being as much as i hate him. i can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. i understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because i'm upset. so i just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

woukd i be the asshole if i back out of the wedding?

edit: wow i checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. i'm so sorry i haven't been reading i'll try and catch up

edit 2: ok guys i don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or nta and said i should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. i'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when i get sad i have an instant reminder of who he really is. and then when it's all over i'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. if i can update a week from now i will. i still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys i've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3am last  monday (or tuesday, or whatever). i have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. that just isn't the case, at all. i love her as much as i love any person on the planet and she has my back. but this wedding is now a week away. it's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiance not to come. everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. my ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. he's as close with the groom as i am with her. if they make big changes now then the day becomes about what he did, not about the wedding. it's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like i said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. if i bring that up then this whole week becomes about that. my best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. they didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. my friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiance to walk in with other people or even separately, but i'm not going to do that. first of all because i think it will look weird. and secondly i foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him one last time--forever and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come august but he fucked it up.",3
"for calling off my wedding because my stbh asked for a prenup?. he makes close to 200k a year while i make 50k a year. my family is dead broke, his family is loaded. i've never asked him for money or to pay my bills. he's the one who wants to do pay for everything and gets mad at me if i pay a bill using my money. we even argued about when we have kids, he wants me to stay home while i want to work. i love my job. i'm frugal. i haven't been to a mall in 15 years and shop at big lots or dollar tree. i've never got attached to his wealth.

&#x200b;

he tells me that it's common and not personal but it's insulting. it makes me feel like he's using me in someway. i understand someone wanting to protect themselves, but he wants me to give up my career to be a housewife and leave me in a situation where he can divorce me and leave me out to dry.",3
"for letting my picky eater child go hungry?. my four year old has decided to become a picky eater. he doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. if he had his way he'd only eat french fries and goldfish. obviously i'm not going to let him only eat those two things. i'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. what i've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, i'll just say something like ""alright, i guess you can eat this later"" and put the food in the fridge. if he asks for a snack, i offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk; at the next meal, i'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. he carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. he's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did i'd probably feed him something else. my mom friends are horrified i'd do this to my kid, and tell me i'm old fashioned. i also feel like the worst mother in the world when my kid is whining about how hungry he is. for the record my husband is completely on board with this method. for letting him go hungry?

edit: this must have reached the front page or something, thanks for all your comments, i'm a bit too overwhelmed to reply to them all. even though this sub i just want to address some common points:

\-i don't want to force him to eat things he hates, i do want to promote his individuality. i feel like i have no other choice but to be strict because if i'm not he'd have me serving him an unhealthy diet.

\-i don't want him to grow up thinking he's entitled to order me or anyone else to cook special meals for him.

\-i do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.

\-i would never let him not eat for a long time like some of you have described. or try to serve him uneaten food for days on end like mommie dearest. i'd cave at that point.",3
"for making my little sister walk home.. so recently i got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea for me to drive my little sister home. she would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. the first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. i took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. she replied with a snarky what and i asked her why she unplugged my phone. she responds with ""i got tired of listening to your music"". i told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. i then unplugged her phone and started driving. then she gets bold and while i'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. so i pullover and tell her to get out. she kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. i wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when i got home. she was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. she went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. when my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks i was justified. from my pov she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. i understand it is a little thing but i gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.

"for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?. i live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

my husband and i are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. about a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. super bright, very loud, apparently very fragile and pretty much right out in the open. when i saw her touching it i told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. now, i'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but i felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

a so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding i pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). i'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people i know think i'm in the wrong here. i personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. i also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, i think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. whose the asshole here?",3
"for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by ""mistake""?. my grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what i'd like. instead of jewelry i asked for her wedding dress. no one else wanted it, i had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. after talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

when she did pass away i was surprised she hadn't written down who got what pieces. since i had already passed on inheritance of a piece i didn't go to the meeting with the rest of the family. basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. from what i heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

since i wasn't there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. it was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. it was sweet of them to do that, so i could have a piece of her everyday too. 

when i got the ring i didn't examine it. it was big enough i thought it was fake too. but then i saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating leo diamonds). i took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. it's value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). essentially i got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. but they chose it for me. 

now, they want to redo the distribution. but i feel like it's fair. i didn't ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. if i refuse?

she packs her bag and gives me a hug and leaves.

"for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?. married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  in our second year of marriage my wife went home when i was deployed and slept with some dickhead (who i'll refer to as sd from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  she hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  sd and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200b;

the reason i didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after i got home.  and she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  no she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though i agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200b;

she immediately cut off all contact with sd and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her.

&#x200b;

well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from sd's mother that sd died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200b;

my wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like i got kicked right in the dick.  i instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. all those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  the pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200b;

i asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  she keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200b;

i can't stop repeating that i'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and i'm re-living all those shitty nights i was sure our family would be shattered and i would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200b;

after some back and forth i put my fucking foot down and told her no, she cannot go.  i said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  aita?

edit: seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her."" as if i'm saying i own her and she's a piece of property to me.  that is not the case, i am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

edit 2: i apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as sd, because that's what he was.  fuck 'im.

my daughter is currently a freshman in college. she has just started her first semester and i'm the one paying the bill. i have been saving for over 10 years to do this and i am happy to do it, as long as i feel she is actually setting herself up for success. during high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. she took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. i supported her through all this because i thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

this last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. my daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. i was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. she is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. now i know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but i was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. when i tried to get why she was switching all i got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in la. apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

i tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""how do you plan to get a job"", etc. and she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. this angered me. i'm the one paying for this i feel i have a right to know and not be blown off like that. i thought over it all day and so last night i sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. i am the one paying for her education and i won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. i told her if she doesn't want to do cs that's fine. but she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys and can get her a career. and if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. she can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

this did not sit well with her. we fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. my ex called me up after and told me that i'm no better than a dictator right now and that i'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what i want.

&#x200b;

all i want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. here?

edit:

wow, did not expect this.

i have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. before i say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because i see the same question sent to me and i don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

i do not have a problem with my daughter getting a la degree.

if my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, i would support her 100%. i don't care what my daughter does with her life. i just want her to do something with her life. i am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. the least i feel i can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. i get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. and many of you have told me that i should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. for those two last points, i feel you are wrong.

this money that i have saved is not a ""gift"". this is what i have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. this is my investment in her. for people who claim that i should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, i respectfully disagree. giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing i could do for her right now. supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. and the fact that she seems to think that i am owed no explanation and that i should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment i am making in her.

i am not arguing whether or not i am wrong. if you all feel i am an asshole for this, then i will accept that.

&#x200b;

i called my daughter and left a message saying that i wish to talk with her about this and that i feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. if my daughter wants to go into la, then that is her choice. weather or not i pay for it will be mine.",3
"for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money. my husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole ""i don't have money for gas"" victim part. this money is not part of our savings or anything. anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. during those two weeks i bought groceries for us, i paid for our take out food, i offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall i was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. he saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. he let me pay for his car insurance. he heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

yesterday i asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and i didn't have cash. he got really nervous when i asked him if i could borrow his debit card. he started to act strange. i asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. i asked him if he was hiding money from me? and he denied it and said i was paranoid and crazy.

he checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. he literally shouted, ""wow wow wow i have extra money!!!! oh my god this is so awesome!!"" and he played the whole i didn't know part.

he continued to argue and i told him that i don't care about the money i care about honesty. why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

it took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly i was going to ask for some money if i knew. he said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

today i asked him to leave the house. i called him cruel and deceitful. i told him that i don't want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

by the way i'm 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. we've know each other for 3 years.

am i the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
i'm just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. and now i'm questioning everything in our relationship. maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. i don't know anything anymore.

***update****
i followed the advice i received here (thank you). he's back home but staying in the guest room. he came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he's apologizing profusely. we'll be taking marriage counseling.",3
"for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?. alright.

i'm a european woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to san francisco for a fancy-pants internship. it was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- i'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time i've ever been out at work.

there is one co-worker who we shall call linda. she's a trans woman (mtf).

linda's position means that me and she and i don't really interact at work often. therefore, i was told about her before i met her. one of my co-workers told me that she existed, i was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. i met linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, i thought that was the end of it.

now, linda does not pass as a cis woman.  she's still a woman and i'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

this now caused an issue. a few of us had a halloween get-together and invited linda. at some point, she and i were alone at our table. we got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative european country. at some point, i made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

her face just fell. she started hissing at me about how dare i presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (i did not misgender her, at no point did i use 'he' or anything like that- i just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. drunk idiot i was, i blurted out 'but...we all know?' which we do.

i was extremely confused. apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. this somehow led linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

linda now, and i say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. she confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare i judge her. i, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. she is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

for saying what i said?",3
"aita: i ditched a girl 40 minutes from her house on our first date. i know the title already sounds like i'm a major asshole, but there is a few more variables that need to be discussed before you make your decision. 

also, this is a throwaway acct for obvious reasons

so i meet a girl on tinder named ""kim"" and we exchange a few messages before deciding to meet up for coffee.

the date is going ok, although it was a bit boring, we grabbed our cup of starbucks (i paid) we chatted for a bit and decided to drive to a cool little outdoor park to go for a walk. 

we drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

i parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

i had to take a leak, so i go to the bathroom and when i walked out, i noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when i walked up to them, he asked who i was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. she was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves. 

at this point i was just over it. i wasn't that interested in her and if she's the type of person to show interest in another guy and exchange info in front of me i have no future with her.

i decided to make up some random excuse to get away from her and just got in my car and drove home. i didn't want to have to deal with her company for a 40 minute drive and was over it. 

oh well, i honestly feel like a bit of an asshole, but also feel it was just in a sense considering what happened....",3
"for refusing to support my wife through her diagnosis after her infidelity. my wife and i had a pretty normal marriage. no kids, both employed and really happy together. for 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

she recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. the first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. dinner went well, came home and went to bed. wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after i had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

we talked, yelled, cried. i spent most of the night sick. told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. i've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. turns out we were wrong, as i was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. i got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. she was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. i told her i wished her all the best, i'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while i'd help financially from a distance, i wasn't physically going back.

they (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. my own friends are split 50/50. i don't want to go back. before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. we had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. we were solid. she just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. she never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. while i certainly don't think anyone deserves this and i am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. i feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing i won't forgive her when it's over. it feels like prolonging the inevitable, and i feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. she has family and friends so she isn't alone. i care about the woman i thought i married, but i no longer love who she turned out to be, so i feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. i'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. aita?

**edit**: to the reddit detectives further down. when i said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. we talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. secondly, i mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when i was told i didn't believe it, i figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment i left. i also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. as far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. and i figured this would be easy to figure out but i guess not, i knew her friend forced her to tell me because i demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. finally, i know a lot of people post made up stories. i'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details i can't prove it. if i wanted karma i wouldn't be on a throwaway, i posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable i think it's time for neutral third party judgement and i was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. to the mods, i'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. i'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",3
"for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?. living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. i have a second grader who i have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

she came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. i thought for a minute that maybe i accidentally grabbed one of my quest bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

for her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. my daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, i put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. the teacher commented on it.

lunchtime came around, and i guess a similar thing happened. my kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week i made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and i guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. this is what sparked the note. 

so i explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured i'd skip the pickles next time. well, it wasn't good enough. just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a pb & j, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

i called the teacher and asked her about the note. teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. i asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""no"" and ""this really shouldn't be a big deal.""

this might be where i fucked up. i told the teacher that i'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. that when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, i will continue to send my kid to school with the foods i pick. teacher got huffy and hung up. 

just to double check, i asked my daughter two things: does she like her lunches? (enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""are the other kids making fun of you?"" because i know that can be an issue. she said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

so aita, or is this teacher way out of line?",3
"for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?. i am 24m and i have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. she is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. i have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. lately i feel like i've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

last week i won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. 

today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

when i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. for just being honest about what i want?

**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...

but the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the experience awkward for the both of us when i could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **edit over**",3
"for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?. my son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. he is only 17 and she is 16. i told him i was proud that he came forward to tell me, but i didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. according to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". we tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

since then, the house has been quite tense. any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. i have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. since my son told us they were pregnant, i have done the following:

1. i wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. i open the door, scream as loud as i can until i know he is awake, and i shut the door. i've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. i purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. i have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, i shut off the internet until he changes it. i will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. while playing one of his games, i told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. i placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. while he was doing this, i went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. i told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. i have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. when he presses me for a reason, i tell him ""you dont have a babysitter. you can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" he has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. yesterday, i did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. i told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. this was the last straw for him.

after his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. he told me i am being completely unrealistic. i reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything i have done so far he has done to me in the past.

his mother tells me i am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but i don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. if anything, i want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

"for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my gf wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?. to preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

i occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition i've had since i was born. over the last year or so my gf(r) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

for the issue at hand. r is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

edit: to answer some faqs, she doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, dr death, ymh, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. i love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when i'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

i've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for that long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. i never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how i felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and i feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. i'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",3
"for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family. hi aita. i am going to try to make this as brief as possible so i don't ramble.

&#x200b;

i dated em for a year and a half. during this time i confided in her some personal secrets, which i don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that i am very sensitive towards.

&#x200b;

we did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. i broke up with her because i found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. recently i found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. she basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information i shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200b;

i sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. she replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. that was the last straw for me, and i sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what em sends me when i ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200b;

her familly is quite religious and they lost it. apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. aita?

&#x200b;

tl:dr my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. i sent them to her family. aita?

&#x200b;

edit: well this blew up. i'll try and answer some of the things i have seen asked most often here:

&#x200b;

1: i feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that i have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. to put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, i was a victim of csa for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. it led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that i struggle with to this day (i never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that i've done that i'd like to not have spread around). she has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200b;

2: by all of her friends and family, i meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. i worded that terribly. i have not been in the best headspace as of late. sorry.

&#x200b;

3: we have not spoken since. i have no desire to speak to her ever again. my coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and i have not heard anything from him. as petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all i care. i have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. maybe i am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. i feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200b;

4: i will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. i have the money to fight a legal case if i have to, though obviously, i would rather not.

&#x200b;

yeah. that pretty much the main things i wanted to clear up. i'll go through the thread tomorrow if i feel up to it and see if there's anything else. it's a bit of a shitshow and i'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",3
"if i didn't give up my honey moon villa to my grandparents?. my family is asian, my husbands side is white.

my husband and i got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our ""real"" one. 
we were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. my husband and i took the villa.

the bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. we made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

we have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. during dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. my grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to ""slave"" and live as ""peasants"" while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

this is bora bora we're talking about. no one is living as a peasant here. 

there was only 1 villa available in our section. had i given it to my grandparents i think it would've been offensive to my husbands grandparents. if there was 3, we would've given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. but unfortunately, there wasn't. i mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

i obviously objected, and said i felt as though my husband and i should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate our marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? wouldn't one just sit back and be grateful they're on a free vacation instead of complaining?

my grandparents freaked out. saying i'm holding money above their head and that i'm being disrespectful and not following their orders. they stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

idk what to do. my side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and i agree. they are so ridiculous. all i wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it's falling apart. 

i don't think i'm the asshole at all, but i've been up all night thinking wether i should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. but another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

so reddit, what do i do? if i denied giving up my villa?



***update***
even though i really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, i decided it'd be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that i was disrespectful.

during breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if i was there. everyone tried calling them-nope we're not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. after a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

i made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. they said they hadn't looked yet and that should be my job if i was kicking them out?? i made sure they knew i was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

they kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

well, i'm not doing that. 
i'll pay for their flight back home, but i've already done enough accommodating on my honeymoon vacation. 

so there you have it. my grandparents weren't even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. i called their bluff. 

after breakfast, i found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. they also didn't get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. my cousins came over and honestly couldn't care less my grandparents are gone, in their words ""they kill the vibe"". so everyone's happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

i'm happy i was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

i have an overflow of messages and comments, that i can't get back to. however, the main question is what my profession is. 

i did not go the usual asian route. i actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. my dad is also an entrepreneur, i looked up to him and am so glad i had him as an inspiration who paved the way. don't give up on your dreams.",3
"for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?. my wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. all they do is text each other occasionally, which i have no problem with. i explained to her early on that i am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. she agreed and it was never an issue until now.

her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and i to meet. once again i explained to her that i have zero interest in such a meeting. i see no point to it, i don't need his blessing or approval, and i have enough friends. plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

she explained that it would mean a lot to her if i would just meet with him. i asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. i snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

she didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. i know my answer is not going to change and i am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. aita? also any advice is much appreciated.

thank you.

**p.s**

i don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but i think i'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. i love my wife but i don't think i have her heart. he was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**edit**

with regards to divorcing her over this:

> i'd rather divorce her than control her. i didn't tell her that i would do this, it will simply happen. i can control what i do (not meeting him), but i cannot control what she does. it would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.",3

to my knowledge, he is still a virgin. he does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and std prevention. another thing my mother and i butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

my mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. she said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. it wasn't necessary. i implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

last night i called my brother and discussed it with him myself. i didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. he also told me they haven't done anything yet. i told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. i told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  i also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that i wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

i tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. my mother is pissed that i talked to him about it when she told me no.

for wanting my brother to be informed and safe?

edit: if it matters, i'm his sister and i am 26. i live out of state.

"update: if i cancelled our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

tldr at the bottom! 

hello, all! it's been some time since i laid out all the bullshit my fiance and i were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. we were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. now, on to what happened! 

my fiance and i talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. we both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. we decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. we were both ecstatic, but, also extremely worried at how our parents were going to take it. especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. but, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and i would then tell mine. 

surprisingly, his parents were so supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. they were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! they also handled telling their families and friends in texas that we were eloping and to get over it. so, that saved us the trouble! his other family was very supportive and wished us the best. my father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. my mother on the hand, was furious.

the phone call to her started off calmly enough and i did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. but, i pressed forward. i told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, i laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. i knew immediately that i was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. i was pissed because i had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. i responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. well, shit hit the fan.

she sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how i never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. i remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. so, i told her not to come. i was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

for days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. i responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that i wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. i offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

my fiance and i have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

tldr: we are eloping, bitches!

edit; since everyone here has become a dictionary for the word ""elopement"", take it however you like. small wedding/elopement, i don't care. i'm marrying the love of my life in the way i want, so, i won either way 👍",3
"for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn't get because they don't have it in plus size?. i and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend's wedding, and for the past few weeks we've been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. my friend ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said ""i love this but they don't have it in my size."" (she is us 14.)

i agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group's conversation moved along. 

yesterday ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. i really liked the green bateau dress so i checked if they had it in my size (i am us 8) and they did so i told our group that i was going to order the bateau dress. no one replied immediately, but i didn't think too much about it because it's not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. i ordered the dress.

a few hours later i got a call from one of my friends saying that ana called her and was upset that i ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn't buy it because it wasn't available in her size. my friend said ana thinks i'm trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that i can wear the dress she likes because i'm skinnier. 

to be honest i have mixed emotions about what ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so i tried calling ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that i didn't intend for her to feel that way. but she hasn't answered my calls or messages. 

so i just want to know: for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress ana liked but couldn't buy because they didn't have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",3
"aitah for letting my coworkers quit because i got fired?. a regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar i worked at for over 10 years, i worked there for 4 years. i made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought i was taking one. i just want to make extra money.

my manager happened to see this on the cameras. there is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it's a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

there is no way to prove there wasn't booze in my shot, i saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove i didn't put liquor in that shot.

i honestly don't and didn't care enough to argue with her about it. i'm about to start a new job since i graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

i trained basically every new person at this bar, and i was honest with them that i was fired in our work group chat. they all started saying if you got fired for that we don't want to work here either. they were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

i told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. i said i'm going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink anything out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. i also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

i then let my anger overtake me and i said ""if you want to find a job where you don't have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. you're all capable people that don't deserve a psycho watching over you when you've put good time into a work place."" i basically contradicted myself. 

i feel like i went over the top, my sister said i should've kept my mouth shut. but i explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the ""mix things together to look like booze so people don't feel rejected when they buy you shots trick"". she thinks it's crazy the new manager won't trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

my old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiance, but she told the new manager that i was trustworthy and i thought the new manager would have some trust considering i was basically running the bar when she came in. 

whatever the case, aitah for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? because as of now 7/10 bartenders where i was fired from are planning a group quit. i don't want the bar to close, but i want my manager to realize that she messed up...",3

"for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how i act in my home?. my mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. it's been ok. she and i are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. she is a traditional hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. i am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" i used to watch what i said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. but when my spouse asked if she could live with us, i said i was okay with it as long as i no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. my spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. i don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

last week, my 10-year-old and i were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. we were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. we are very mature, i know. but when i said, ""i fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in spanish, ""don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. i will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" and i said, in english (i can understand spanish but can't speak it well), ""this is my home. you don't get a say in how i interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" she stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

my spouse says ita because i embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because i expected her to accept too much, too quickly. they also say that i am being a little culturally insensitive and that i need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how i spoke to her, so i need to apologize. but i think it was important for her to see that i will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that i won't be policed in my own home.",3
"for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?. i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

things worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

i have no regrets, and i don't think i'm an ass, but given i lurk this sub a lot i'm curious for your verdict in this matter. aita?",3
"for exploding on my father's wife. throwaway  

hear me out on this one.

in regards to ages, i'm 17, dad is 43, and father's wife 27 or 28.

six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. my mom initiated divorce. six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. my dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day i can truly forgive him.

i do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, i begrudgingly show respect. i have never called her out of her name until later in this story. if she speaks to me, i will say something back. if i am in her home, i will clean up after myself. however, i will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. this is something she cannot accept.

i have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. while at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that i was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why i would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. i guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

she then revealed that when my dad gets back from his tdy (temporary duty assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. i have never been in any of the previous family portraits because i refused to and my dad said i didn't have to.

i told her i was not going to participate

she asked why i was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

six years' worth of hurt came out. i told her she was a fool to ever think i was her child or that i considered her family. from my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. i took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

she turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful i was and i had no right to talk to her in such a manner. i fully admit i called her a bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. after realizing what i had said, i left and haven't talked to her since.

everyone that i have talked to say i should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and i don't mind doing that.  however, certain people say i shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

so who is the asshole?",3
"for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request). **edit:** well fuck me i just spoke with my maid. she says she hasn't seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she's never seen before. from her description i've never heard of him either. she kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

i guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. so before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. honestly thought my marriage was perfect i never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

my wife and i have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. my wife is a stay at home mom while i work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

we live in hong kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. our maid is a 34 year old filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. she lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

the problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. she hasn't given any specific reason other than ""i don't want a maid anymore."" i honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but i don't want to fire her because:

- she has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- she relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- we still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- i work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. my wife doesn't cook nor clean so i am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

the woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and i don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

i'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

"for telling my wife to get out of bed and feed the damn cat.. alright everyone, i need some judgement on this one...

my wife and i have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. this only happens on weekends.

monday-friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. however on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. he will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

here's where the story takes a twist. awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. when we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. i thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

my wife disagreed. her reasons range from:

concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

concerned it's a waste of batteries.

i've told my wife i understand all of her concerns but i still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. she still disagrees.

so i did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ultimatum! 

i told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, i'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

so reddit, aita?

edit: i'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

edit 2: many people have been demanding i pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real ah in question. sadly i am a reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. if anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, i will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

"for having an almanac?. a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

in an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. bf 30s is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me also 30s over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. he wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. 

i saw the condoms in his clear ziploc bag (note: plainly visible, i did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course i asked about them. his response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

reddit, i watched him combine otc meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. i don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" but now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like i ruined new year's for asking this. 

for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

edit: he has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. i don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. i am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.",3
"for telling my friend i didn't appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband's birthday party?. my friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. the party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. we've been working on some remodeling projects, so we've been on a strict budget. my husband and i wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

when we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. when we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. i asked a passing waiter if i could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. the waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

my friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but i was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

as the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend's husband with the check. my friend's husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ""i know this isn't how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. we told you that."" i suddenly started panicking inside. i was trying to catch someone else's eye to see if they were panicking as much as i was. one other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. i opened the check, and the total was $211. i thought i was going to throw up. i have never spent that much on a meal.

i held my shit together because i didn't want to make a scene. the couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn't paying. they said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

i ended up messaging her and said, ""thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*'s party. we had a great time. just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. we are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. thanks again.""

my friend said, ""sorry! should have given you a heads up. glad you came."" and we haven't spoken or hung out since. i've tried to set up coffee dates and girl's nights but she just bails or never responds. it's been almost 3 months, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all.",3
"for calling a pregnant woman a c***?. i was at the bookstore the other day and as i approached the cash i saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

as i got closer i listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. she was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. she was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. the girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and i could tell she felt bad. when the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". as the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
at this point, i had felt horrible for the young girl and i knew i had to say something. so i looked at the woman and i said ""i just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". the woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. i said i didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. she cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. he came in, didn't say much (i'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

now, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she's ok. 

ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

i still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in using the c word?

edit: a few people have mentioned that i should not have included the hijab comment. it was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, i meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't even have the chance to get a kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. sorry if it came across as pandering. was not my intention.

"for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an april fools joke?. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


am i the asshole?

"for showering my niece?. obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. also a heads up i personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that i feel like i'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what i actually did wrong. 

so last weekend i  25m was watching my niece 3f. i have a daughter 5f myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. on this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. what was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. seriously i went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when i came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. i immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. i helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while i washed hers. 

i thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly i didn't even think twice about doing it. my sil does not agree. she keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that i should've called her to okay it first. that mindset is kinda confusing to me. like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who i always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of atlantis. plus, what was i supposed to do? let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? however, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when i'm a man and not her dad. are they right and i'm missing the point or am i right that there's nothing weird about it?

eta: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so i'll address them. 

1. my daughter's mother is dead and i'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. idk if my sil was abused. will throw out there though that i was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and i as kids.

3. i was *not* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think i was. i never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. thanks whoever gave me silver.",3
"for taking care of my dad financially against my wife's wishes?. i'm m35, my wife is f28, we've been married for 3 years now. my dad is 65 and retired now with a small but decent pension, my mom passed away when i was 10 and my dad never remarried and never had another relationship to my knowledge. he raised me and my sister by himself and worked 3 jobs for over 10 years to support my sister and i through university. my dad is the hardest working person i've ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. he was born in a tin hut in rural bangladesh and came to canada with nothing and worked tirelessly everyday to help himself out. i am very successful and have been taking care of my dad since i graduated uni and i provide him with about $1,000 a month and my sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. his house is paid off and i paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy about but his place needed major work. 

my wife came to me last week and suggested i stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz i bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. i told her that i want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k i give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. he also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so i'm extremely happy for my dad. the money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. my wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't i pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and i own our condo we live in outright. she basically called me an asshole for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can figure things out himself.

"for skipping my child's birth to see my dying father?. i had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too

&#x200b;

my wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. the day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). i decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. my wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. if you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but i'm mainly here for judgment

"for hiding my personal life at work?. i'm in a little trouble at work because i've been sort of hiding my personal life. i've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. i'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. with that, i never, ever talk about home life. i'm not ashamed of my life i just don't like to discuss it at work. my coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. if i'm asked any questions i usually redirect or move on to someone else. in this manner, none of my coworkers knew i'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

we hired melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. she spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. however, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. try as she did, i never gave her anything. my coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. compartmentalization aside, i've made some great friendships at work. there are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. they are a big part of my life but i'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. they're hugely important and come before everything else but i'm not a sycophant and i enjoy the ten hours a day i'm at work when i get to be an adult and talk about things other than jojo siwa and the newest jenndashian exploit.

last week, friday, melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. at lunch she announced to everyone that i am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. i play softball, i kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that i'm on facebook. she couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. i use a shortened version of my name (ali from alexandra) and my married name on fb so i'm not sure how she found me, unless she used whitepages and put two and two together. i've already reported her to hr.

but the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a bfd. one of my friends said she's hurt that i don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". i tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, i just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. i never bring work home. when i'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. heck, i chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when i'm not there. i've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. i honestly don't see the problem. i've never lied to them, i've never given them false info, i've never made up wild tales about my life. i'm still the same person i was, now they just know more about me than they did.

eta: i know this has been posted three times today. i didn't know reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and i thought it was the account i was posting from so i created a second throwaway and then a third because i never got confirmation the post was uploaded. i couldn't even get past the white screen with the little reddit face spinning in the center. those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. this one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

eta:  i don't have any sort of interesting update. hr brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us wtf is going on. i presented my side, as detailed above, melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. i asked my hr rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. there were several. then i asked him to search my married name, or the one i go by on fb, ""ali smith"". there were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. in any case, too many to count. i haven't touched my own page since i reported the incident. it was about thirty names from the top but like i said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. i do have an instagram page that's on private but i only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. she found me night before last and friended me. naturally i blocked her. hr gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. my rep wasn't sure why melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called bs on her for claiming it was innocent. so that's that. that's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. however, i took the advice from this sub and i'm making amends. they're all most receptive. i'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. but they know enough about me to know i'm not an automaton or anything.",3
"if i don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? my cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.. using a throwaway since money is involved here. lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

i was born in south africa but emigrated when i was just a few months old so i am totally american. i come from a family of full on apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for america. my parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. they made a small fortune in south africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. to be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the us, but still the money because they were white and well connected in south africa. 

my grandmother died recently. she lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in socal so i figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe i'd get some family heirlooms. my head about popped off when i saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). money that will literally change my life. 

my parents business failed so i wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. she's also now married, lives in rancho santa fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. she claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in south africa. she is seriously chiding me that *if* i plan on keeping it, then i am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

i have student loans i could pay off, i could actually have a down payment on a house, i could invest, i mean...i know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. i understand where it came from but i also can't possibly imagine giving it away. i have no idea what charities are like in south africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and i'm better off just keeping it. 

i understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",3
"for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?. my (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. she made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. the jokes all seemed lighthearted and i just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. fast forward to our 20 week scan. we go in super excited and nervous. i don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

we go in and find out we are having a boy. my wife immediately bursts into tears and i hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. she doesn't stop crying the whole day. i let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

it's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. she refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

now that it's been nearly a month i'm starting to get a bit frustrated. it's just such an overreaction. i told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. she cried and called me an asshole. i told her she needs to get a grip. i felt awful but i feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous.

"for telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce. yeah, i'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

i came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). her mother is not happy. she hasn't been happy for a long time. her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids i've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

she's made it no secret she hates me. i remember when she was 13 or 14, i paid for us to go to disney land as a family vacation (cliche, i know). she refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. i was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, i went along with it and stayed home.

stuff like that is the norm. she'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. she'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. it's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. but it's ruined the marriage, because i've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. anything i do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

anyway, my wife and i separated over this. it's just too much for me to bare. but i'm not mad at my wife, i'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

i decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. i didn't do this to spite her, because frankly i'm ready to move on with my life. i did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. i did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. say it's going to emotionally scar her. but quite frankly, i think she needed to be told.

"for not paying for the meal?. on a road trip last week, my girlfriend and i stopped at a rural diner for brunch. we sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). it was a very nice meal honestly. our total was around $25. i was ready to pay with my debit card.

the waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. unfortunately i had zero cash on me. ""how were we supposed to know?"" i asked. she shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. there was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

she sighs and points to an atm on the other side of the dining room. at this point i'm still apologetic so i went there with my card. i noticed it had a fee of, i shit you not, $9. i asked to speak to the manager. she brought the owner.

i told the owner this is ridiculous. i suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that atm. nope. he threatened to call the police. i said go ahead. my girlfriend felt the same way. long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

i told my sister about this today. she thinks the cops were wrong and i was being an asshole. because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" i think the owner is the asshole. the only part i regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

"for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife. i met my wife in my early 30s. she was in her mid 20s at the time. i was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. she on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

so when i meet her we click instantly and i fall head over heels for her. we get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. when we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. obviously i was jealous but i went along with it since it seemed logical.

so she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while i work 12 hour days and then some. i'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

a couple years ago i discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. divorced obviously followed.

the only major asset we had in the us was our house, which was a premarital asset. we had a shared bank account, but since i am a finance guy i handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, i'd have no problem paying what's fair. but the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

so in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

so here i am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. so i sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. once abroad i immediately stop alimony payments.

now she has no legal recourse (i've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

the reason i'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. my son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. i figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",3
"for ditching my date and causing a scene?. i'm 19f and my date was 25m, i was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while i was half way through my session. 

i get an ig message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and i have 40 followers. 
he explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so i'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

we catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, i take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. i smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. we're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

i study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when i freak. he makes a comment about how high i am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point i start to get really scared.
he keeps asking if anyone knows i'm with him, who i live with, how much money i make & how much i have on me etc. just weird questions. i was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction imo was much more extreme. i was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. my perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say i was genuinely scared.

i hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so i could be around people and also so he wasn't dui, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that i felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

i get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. i go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""i'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see i'm upset. i sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. he addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" the owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

i felt guilty since i had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, i'm not 100% sure if i was in danger and if i could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. i tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him i was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

edit: some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, i'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? correct me if i'm wrong please. i genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way i did and if i'm the ahole for handling a bad date this way. i see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here irl i had very mixed and negative reactions. hence why i got on here and despite all that, i do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying i did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",3
"for not wanting to share my son?. my son died at age 4. on the first mothers day after he died my husband got me a necklace with some of his ashes in. i wear it every single day.

my aunt is not someone i see often. she got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. she came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. when we were told he didn't have long left i asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. i figured she was in denial, maybe. i certainly was. she then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. i said no because i want him to stay with us. all of him. then my aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said i was being selfish, he was her family too. 

i still said no. she said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. but so was i. but it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. she's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old. 

so tell me, as my aunt seems to think i am, am i being the asshole?",3
"for leaving/ghosting my gf that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me. **update:** 

i was not expecting to post an update so soon, but i was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. however i had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. however of course they know that i can't avoid work. so they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as i get home from work. with them is my girlfriend. they insist i talk to my girlfriend and i eventually relent and our parents leave.

once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...and then she gives the most ridiculous excuse i've ever heard. she says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. this emotional support quickly turned physical

this makes no sense. we have always talked about having kids excitedly.

she takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. she also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if i don't believe her. so she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. she says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. i ask to see her phone. she reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since i threw her out.

i tell her i need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. once outside i lock the doors, unblock her on whatsapp, and send her a long text. i'm reciting this by memory so i don't have to open whatsapp and see her reply.

>whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. but you should know the following. first, if the child is mine, i will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. we will never get back together. the moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. secondly, i will not interact with you at all until the child is born. don't reach out to me until then, i want nothing to do with you. finally, i will not have any role in the kid's life - nor will i sign any birth certificate - until i get a paternity test. this child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. i will never forgive you for that.

i have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. i also won't post any updates after this. i get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so i'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

---------------------------------

**original post**

----------------------------------------------------

**with regards to the meta post:** i know i'm not an asshole for leaving her. i'm more concerned with the way i went about it.

-------------------------

my gf and i have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. she quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

last week i discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-bf from high-school. i needed to use her phone to call mine, and went i unlocked her phone it was open on a whatsapp conversation between them. i have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and i don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. angry that i've put so much into this relationship and woman that i thought would be the mother of my future children. angry that i've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. just angry.

so i arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as i can find, and leave it outside. text her of what i've done, and say if she wants to get anything else i've missed to have her brother come and get it - i don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

anyway, since i did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. they say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if i kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

what do you guys think? am i the asshole here? should i swallow my pride and approach this differently?

**edit2: the lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**",3
"for attacking a muslim's beliefs when she didn't want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?. long time lurker, here is my first post!

so i (f16) was on a flight from dubai to new york, so it was quite a long trip. usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother's friend couldn't afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn't present during this whole situation.

when we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. i was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. i saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

i wasn't paying attention but i took off my headphones when i heard my brother's friend say no to the lady. she then said: ""it is against my religion to touch men in public"" and my brother said,

""but we're not touching you.""

she looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother's friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. i thought she was so entitled, so i told them,

""don't move. just ignore her.""

she then proceeded to ask me if i knew them, so i said yes. she asked to switch with me. so this is what i said,

""no. i don't want the middle seat because i'm very claustrophobic (i'm not, i just prefer the aisle seat so i can stretch my legs)"" and she said, 

""that's not my problem.""

that's when i got really pissed and i said it,

""your religion is not our problem. should've chosen better seats then"" 

then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that's the last we saw of her. i'm guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

when we got back from the trip, my brother's friend told me he was going to move and i wasn't right to attack her religion like that.

so reddit, aita?

"- i moved for my husband's job, my kids now hate me. bit long, stick with me. throwaway because i'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.

my ex and i split 5 years ago now. we had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. he's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. after my divorce, i reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. he's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. we married 2 years ago. 

a year ago, he got orders to move to texas from where we all were in california. my older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. i approached my ex and told him the situation. i said i know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. he blew his top and said absolutely not, i wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

the judge ended up ruling in his favor, and i was awarded summers and every other holiday. i was absolutely devastated. i moved, and i've barely seen the kids since. they came at christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. the older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on facetime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. my daughter has said i chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but i can tell he's angry. 

i've asked my ex to talk to them about it and he basically said i chose to leave, it's my fault and he's not getting involved in ""our issues"". so, let me have it reddit, aita?",3
"for not reacting well when i found out my coworker is dating my ex-husband?. i (26f) was married to ""sam"" (30m) for three years. he was bisexual, which i knew and accepted. we divorced a year ago, after some infidelity on his part. we have no children, and we do not speak.

i work in an admissions office, and my coworker ""andy"" recently got a new boyfriend. we are not close, but i congratulated him and moved on with my day. during lunch break, i was part of a larger group conversation, and one of my other coworkers asked andy for details.

i was shocked when he pulled up a picture of my ex-husband. i blurted something out, and everyone else basically went silent. i explained to andy that i had been married to sam, and that he was a serial cheater and had abused painkillers in the past (also true). i ended with saying, ""...but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date sam.""

fast forward to thursday. andy apparently complained about my ""homophobia"" to hr, and i explained the situation to our rep via email. i think the situation has resolved, but i'm not sure if i did anything wrong by warning andy. i suppose i was trying to wreck my ex's new relationship more than i was trying to help my coworker. does that make me the asshole? aita?

edit: since people are asking, here's a transcript of the conversation. i tried to make it as close to verbatim as possible. sorry i wasn't more detailed in the post.

me, seeing the picture: ""wait, what?""

andy: ""...this is the guy i was telling you about.""

me: ""that's my ex-husband!""

andy: ""really? he knows where i work, and he never mentioned you.""

me: ""it's absolutely him. and i should warn you, he's a compulsive cheater and he pops pills. he even stole a bottle of painkillers from my mom, and i found them hidden in his truck. when we were married, he was literally doped up all the time. he's a train wreck, but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date him.""",3
"thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up.... yeah, i know this sounds awful.

my (32m) wife's (35f) daughter (16f) recently announced she is pregnant. 

she claims she doesn't know who the father is. i suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. i mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? it can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

anyway, moving on. she is adamant on keeping the baby. abortion is out of the question apparently. wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. they're both ecstatic.

the problem i have with this is:

1. my wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. she's still in school and fully intends to go to college. my wife and i will 100% end up looking after it.

2. i am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. my wife works part time and makes very little money. i don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. i wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. she's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. i feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

i raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""this isn't up to you. this is her decision to make. we will support her.""

i agree it's her decision, but why do i have to support her?

as it stands now, i'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. i'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am i prepared to pay to raise it.

i fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

"for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?. so this month i was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which i had booked and seats selected for. i specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

well, a very obese man boards and i can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. i assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. i'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

i get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. i sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. after a minute, i decided to be upfront and tell him:

""sir, i'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

he wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. it just wasn't enough, though. he still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. i'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

i end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. she instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. she goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. this causes a very awkward silence. 

the guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. he mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. i felt bad for him but i was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort i paid for. the flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. the guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where i made my offer. 

i told the guy, ""look, i'll put up with this if you give me $150 — that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

he instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. he even told me he appreciated it. 

well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. i just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

from my perspective, i gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and i was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). a win-win. he wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

after the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but i ignored them. this leads me to beg the question, aita? ",3
"for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?. my wife and i are not from the us but we have lived here for the last 2 years. on a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. however since we are not used to american portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

when we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. we will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. however occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). when they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. we were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

when we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. he asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. after around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". he gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

here? this seems so foreign to me. we still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? it shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

edit: sorry i could have worded the title better.

"if i tell my wife that i will no longer be helping with her pregnancy cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco chip ice cream at 3am?. this happened a couple of days ago and i was really pissed. i'm here because i want to know if i'm in the wrong here. 

my wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. i've done everything to support her. i make breakfast everyday and i make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. 

yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. we had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. i really wanted to get her the ice cream. she told me that she wanted choco chip. i drove for an hour to find a place at that time. but they didn't have any choco chip at that time. i didn't want to disappoint her, so i got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

when i got back, i told her that i didn't find choco chip. idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. she threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me i didn't love her. she also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. i slept in another room. 

now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. but i did not sleep with her at night. i've decided that i don't want to do anything now. this is not the first time this has happened. i'm not a fantastic cook. she insists that i make something for her, but when i make it she always tells me that it's horrible. she later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). here??",3
"for having professional hair and makeup for a wedding when the bride didn't. hi, y'all.

my brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on sunday. i (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while i was a guest, i wasn't in the bridal party. 

they got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. the dress code on the invitation was ""formal."" for the three weddings i've been to with formal dress codes (and the eight i've been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. that is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. a few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my sil could hire locally. 

well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. when her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn't used a professional either, nor had she. 

it was kind of awkward in pictures, but i didn't really see a big deal.

well, yesterday, i got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to ""upstage her"" and that sort of thing. quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (fyi, my brother thought i looked pretty and didn't see an issue except ""when did you become a woman?"")

"for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a sahm i am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?. my wife and i have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and i actually just got a new job. 

at my old job i was working 45-50 hours a week. at my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. i make a lot more though so there's that. the pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. my wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a sahm which is what she's wanted. 

the issue is that my wife and i aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. we also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

i told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. these cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and i also think it's practical.  she was mostly agreeable to that. but then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

i told her there was no way i was going to be taking on as many work hours as i am and then come home to cook or clean too. that would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

she looked at me like i was some sort of neanderthal but i think what i'm saying is completely fair. i'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. i recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce i would support her 100%. but i think it's fair that if i'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours i don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

obviously my wife and i will have to work this out between ourselves. i'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. 

**edit: well this blew up since i last checked it. i can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. i will read as many of the (4.2k??) comments as i can. i think i'll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**",3
"for telling people my sister's youthfulness comes from plastic surgery and fillers?. my sister is 34 and i'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. 

i don't know why she seems to have aged early or why i look younger - i was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. i used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

i moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. last weekend i went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and i was shocked by her appearance.

i knew she used botox, but this was next level. her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. i asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". i'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

she asked me not to tell anyone and i said of course i wouldn't. but then...

now, i thought she looked weird because i know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

i was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""it's probably because i didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

as a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, i was hurt by that. without thinking i blurted out (louder than i'd intended): ""oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

i regretted it before i'd even finished saying it, but i thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

"if i told my nieces their dad died and isn't me?. so my brother passed away in august, we're identical twins with the small exception that he had facial hair and i do not, other than that we're pretty much carbon copies. my sil did not take their kids (2 and 4) to the funeral as it would've been traumatic to them and i totally respect that, however, she has also let them believe that he is me. i've been at the house often helping out with the kids and doing whatever i can with them and i feel as if i am also sort of helping her in a way by not really letting them process that i am, in fact, not my brother. she's caught onto it too, but won't tell them and i think it's cruel on her part to do that to them. she has to be apart of the telling process but she keeps putting it off and i refuse to let it snowball into something far worse on the children and her. she's never made any advances toward me but i also believe in her mind this is how she's coping, by pretending he isn't really gone because she ""technically"" does still see ""his"" face everyday. would i be the asshole if i told them that their dad died and it's really just uncle j helping around the house?

i'm also concerned that at a certain point, i can't ""reintroduce"" myself back into their lives because i look exactly like him.",3
"for going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? wib if i reported her?. i'm black. my husband is white. he has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who loves me, and who i think isn't too bad herself. my niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. we hang out a lot to give my sil a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

i was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. she was defiant, and i'm all about consequences after two warnings. she kept running from me laughing her butt off, so i told her it was time to go. normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a gigantic fit so i had to carry her. she wasn't screaming in a ""who is this help me"" way but in a clearly understandable ""no, i want to stay and play. auntie(me), no"" way. but also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

as we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. i smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. she then got in my face like ""do you know this child."" i'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so i just said yes and tried to step around her. she then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" i told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""no mother would ever say that about her kid"". yeah, maybe. but she can't spell so. she then demanded i give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

i was pissed. i told her i don't have to prove anything to her and i'm leaving with my kid. she then literally ran  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. cops called. security guy asks what's up. i was polite to him but i told the lady off. i said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to immediately jump to kidnapping was insane. the cops showed, and they asked my niece who i am ""auntie (me)!"" and i showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. it's done. 

she  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. i want to report it. she'd been watching us and saw my niece and i hanging for at least 30 minutes familiarly. so while i could have showed her the pictures, i didn't feel like i needed to. it's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. now, i have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. i'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. i just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""this isn't my mom"" card. and then i really would need the cops to be called because i'd kill her. 

i get she was concerned. and that unlikely i'd adopted a white baby. but also, 100% fuck off, lady. aita? would i be if i complained to the facility?",3
"for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?. several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. before we start, some background about my friend: i've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. he worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. he paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. he recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

on to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. i could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. when we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""at 33 years old i shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""taking public transportation is for losers"". as someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, i'll admit i took some offense to that. i've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

the real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. here's where i may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

after a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. after they left, my wife said i shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and i almost ruined dinner for everyone. my friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

so, aita?",3
"for allowing the girls on my hs track team (i'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;. this is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because i'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. i just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that i have to be in his office monday morning and i'm scared shitless. 

basically i just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. the school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so i volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. we have some very talented girls and i enjoy it. 

we were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. on monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. they argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. i was a little nervous but agreed. apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. i'm so naive i thought initially people were just being charitable but when i saw boys from surrounding schools i knew somthing was up. and it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. the girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

parents are furious with me and obviously it's gone up the chain. i'm hoping to god i can chalk this up to my inexperience and i'm not fired buf when i had a 6'4"" dad screaming in my face that he's going to get my fired...i'm scared. 

am i the asshole for allowing this?

edit: just as a quick update, in rhe last few minutes i've gotten two texts from parents offering me thier support and willing to show up with me monday to at the very least talk about how out of line the dad was who screamed in my face, that makes me feel a little better.",3
"for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?. okay this is so stupid and i really feel like i'm nta but my friend is adamant that i am so i'm seeking reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

my girl friends and i were recently at canada's wonderland and having been there dozens of times since i was a kid (am now in my 20s), i know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

so basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

well, for the last few times i've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and i always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. there never is and i use the bathroom stalls there. on my way out i'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

my friend now thinks i'm selfish and rude for doing this. she thinks that i should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

i don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

my friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. this is something i truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, i'm starting to question if she's right?

please tell me if i'm wrong, seriously, i don't get it. 

tl;dr: apparently i'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

edit: this is epic.. i really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. thank you to everyone that replied. i'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

and to all women, i'm sorry our bathrooms suck. i'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. tiny bladder club!!",3
"for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?. last fall, my husband and i went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

in the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. she was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. the wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. i thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. she didn't tell the couple tho. just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

we traveled 600 miles to the wedding. we treated the trip like a vacation. spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

the day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. i hate dressing up so i was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

my husband and i had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. a few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. i wore a hoodie, daisy duke shorts and cute sandals. 

i noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but i figured they didn't get the memo. the bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which i thought was weird for a casual wedding. the reception was awesome. nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. we had a blast. 

so we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. they thought it was very disrespectful. apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. this explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

tbh we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. and they never specified the dress code in the invitation. but i still have to ask. aita?",3
"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?. i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

"for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me?. basically i'm 25m and she's 23f.

she gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. she cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. she always goes to the same coffee shop. 

me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. she always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. that was fine. 

anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. i trust her entirely, i know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

anyway, i went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. i ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and i shit you not he said ""oh is that for emma?"" and when i looked shocked he went ""i just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". i said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. the guy kinda laughed and i said that i appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, i think he was flirting. he laughed again and said sure thing. 


i didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare i embarrass her like that. this pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! she said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay.

"for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?. hi everyone, i'd like some input. 

my wife and i struggle to make ends meet. we strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. this includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

recently our dd dropped the milk and spilled it. it was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. my wife said she'd figure it out. i know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, i figured she must have decided to dip into that. boy was i wrong. 

the next week i noticed our food was a little...higher quality. a couple of brand name things, even a roast on sunday with asparagus. i figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when i asked she said ""oh no, i found a bunch of money off coupons."" then she showed a few to me. 

they were those ""earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. she had gone there and dug through the garbage! she said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

i was speechless. i asked her how she could lower herself like that. she replied that she did it for our kids. when i asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

i'm so disgusted guys. i can't believe she did this. i don't even want to look at her. she on the other hand is mad at me, and says i'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. for expecting my wife not to dumpster dive?

edit: ok! i am definitely the asshole. after reading all of your comments, i really thought about it. i talked to my wife, and told her i was sorry for the way i acted. she is annoyed but willing to forgive me. i was actually mad at myself. the reason we are struggling is because i was in an accident a few months ago. i slid through a stop light on an icy road. it has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade i've worked in for 15 years. i'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what i used to make. we are getting by, but it is tight. and i don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. my wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). i guess i was just mad at myself because i can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. i'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. thanks for the honesty guys.

"for letting my kids reject hugs and kisses from family?. my two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

my wife and i agreed we wouldn't force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to ""give grammy a kiss goodbye"" and he said ""don't want to"" and we said ""that's fine, wave goodbye then."" and he waved and said goodbye. 

she started to say ""oh, no kiss for grammy?"" but i shut that down with ""(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings"" and we left it at that. she seemed to understand. 

my sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said i was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he ""didn't want to"". 

i tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn't the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it's not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn't treasure her visit. 

we're about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well.

"for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?. my daughter just turned 6. we had a birthday party for her on saturday. that morning was pretty hectic. i was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and i didn't notice.

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

"for making gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?. so, i've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. but basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

i've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

well, it didn't stop. 

anyway, since i'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, i've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until i kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

the noises are kind of, like, skreeeeeeeoooooooash! skreeeeascchhhhh! followed by snorts and the like.

so far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what i'm doing downstairs. i brush it off like it's no big deal and i really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. his audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor gargoyle rears its ugly head.

"for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?. edit 1: wow, thank you all so much for you input. i will post an update in a day or so

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

"for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?. tl;dr at bottom

okay so i'm almost 19.

when my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. they got married later on, converted to christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

i know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. he didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. i thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

but anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter i'm really close with. she's christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last may. then her boyfriend left her over it. i absolutely adore her baby, and i try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

i'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and i was messaging them three way last night. i was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why i would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

i told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. but they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. it went on for a few more messages.

i got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""yeah i hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

three hours later and there was still no response; i knew i was in deep shit.

and i was! my parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning i'm using my old old old phone right now. they were very tense with me today. i was very earnest.

"for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?. so i have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when i was 13. i never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. it's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

i worked with him on and off through college and i've gotten very good at it.

he asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after i graduated. but my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

i do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. he also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

to no one's surprise, my father said i needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

i refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. my father was upset but i guess he figured he couldn't stop me. we continued having weekly dinners.

for some reason, people are liking my company's work more. i have expanded my company more than my father ever has. i also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. i don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless i want to.

last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. i admit i did feel bad so i offered him a full time job in my company and that i'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. but i told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

this made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. he said i betrayed him. then i basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

i do feel kind of guilty i ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. but at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"for telling a girl at the gym that her pants are see through?. my gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. this means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  because it might help with context i'm 6', 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

while in between sets, i'm standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when i see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that i can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

like 90% of people in the gym i just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn't exist.  so i move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and i can pretty much see her butthole.  i don't mean if i squint and stare, i mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

no idea why i cared (am married and completely uninterested) but i go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

""hey this is super creepy, but i'd feel creepier if i didn't say something.  when you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.""

again i thought i was being helpful and that she'd want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. this girl practically screams ""you fucking pervert! stop staring at my ass!"" 

not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, i go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.  

i tell my wife about it who laughs and says i was totally an asshole for saying that and she'd be pissed and super embarrassed if someone did that to her. so reddit, settle this, aita?",3
"for telling my kid i would help him get a switch if he can beat ocarina of time?. my 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a nintendo switch so he can play botw. right now he has $200 saved up. at his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

i know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. now i have to say, he's a really good kid. kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. he's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, i thought of a more fun solution to help him get his switch. i told him, if you can beat ocarina of time (without googling for help - though i would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old n64, i'll pay for the rest of your switch and get you botw. wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. part of my reasoning too is i just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and oot is a timeless classic. 

he jumped at the idea! after a weekend of playing, he's already at zoras domain as young link. he seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. he's only played minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

but anyway i told a couple friends about it, and they think i'm a massive dick. that i'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that i should just get him the switch because he's already such a good kid. now i'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

"for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?. my husband and i have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is african american and i am white (this will be important later on in the story). my son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. the other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3
"for not wanting to be involved with a child i helped conceive?. i got pregnant in high school, when i was 17 (i am just turning 30 now). i wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. he involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

i was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. i was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. delivery was a nightmare. the whole process was so traumatic that i've been diagnosed with ptsd from it, for which i've been in therapy for the last four years.

in my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so i did that. i haven't regretted it for a minute (i do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, i do not regret giving up parental rights). i do not think about this child, i do not think of myself as having a child, i am not a mother. i have never met the child and never want to.

last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. i told him that we did things according to his wishes and i never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

he and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought i'd 'come around.' they want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. i won't. am i the asshole here? all i have done is what i have always said i would do.

note: sorry, english isn't my first language. i also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very us-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as i am not from us and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",3
"for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash?. background: i have this friend mandy who i guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" she has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

recently mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

this was about january and mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and mandy has actually gained weight. mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

i was helping mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge tupperware bin the back of her suv. i assumed she wanted it unloaded but as i moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. i asked her about it. she got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. i asked her if this why she's gaining weight. she told me to fuck off. i texted her husband because in the heat of the moment i was furious she had spoken to me like that.

her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. mandy is blaming me, am i the asshole here?


edit: i accept my judgment and i won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and i don't want to he part of this anymore. no i don't want to have sex with him. nor did i ever imply or infer that. enjoy your day.


edit 2: based on some responses that said i was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which i accept) i called and told mandy that i was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. she said that i am just another person oppressing her and that even the avengers were oppressing her these days. i asked her what she meant (won't spoil the movie) but i explained to her that i was acting out of frustration and avengers is just a movie and now i was really concerned. she said i could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we're done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. thank you for participating but i think it's a dead subject at this point. i hope she gets the help she needs",3
"for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that i taught his siblings because of the custody arrangement?. edit/update:

the moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

i know many, many people have asked about the skillset i mentioned. i just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. i will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. it's just a niche product and not many people do it. the tools and techniques are unorthodox.

i spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

i have talked to my younger kids and i explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

they agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. but they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. i actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

however, i'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. he is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

i reached out to a teacher in alaska who i know casually. he might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

i need to scrounge up some money and see if i can send my son there. but again, it's alaska and i'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

i don't know what else i can offer at this point. my wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. she wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but i really think it's a bad idea. they need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. i don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

i'll be meeting my son this friday for dinner. i hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

i also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. they've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. it's not helping.

thanks everyone.


this is the original story:

this has quite literally fractured my family.

i have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. i have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

my divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

i have a particular skillset i'm was very good at. and all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. unfortunately, i have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

this was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, i would do camping/vacations etc. i didn't have time to teach him properly.

also, anything i did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

the major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. i provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. this company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

my older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. especially compared to his siblings.

part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what i knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and i told him i couldn't.

and now, i'm not well enough to teach anymore.

he is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. that he'll do the finances.

this was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. and that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

i'm really at a loss here. i thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

my oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. they are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

our sunday family lunches are no longer happening and i'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. and everytime i see him i'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. it kills me because i made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

he accused me on saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. i haven't been able to sleep since.

should i have done all this differently?",3
"for telling my son that i don't trust his boyfriend. my son(26m) introduced us to his boyfriend(23m) few years ago. they live together and they're pretty serious, but me and my husband don't know anything about him. we see each other often. i just know his age and name. 

he's financially stable, he owns a huge house, when we asked him where he worked, he just chuckled awkwardly and didn't answer us. he never answers any questions. 

recently my son talked to me and said that he wanted to propose to him. i was happy for him of course. i congratulated him. then we started talking about some stuff. he asked me opinion about him. i told him that i basically don't know him so i don't trust him that much, but since he loves him it's his choice. he got upset at that and left pretty soon. he has been acting distant since that.",3
"for naming my dog askim?. 8 years ago i got a gorgeous chug. while extremely high i decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is askim, because when people ask me his name and i tell them about 50% of the time they'll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it's name. it's hilarious. 
i had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. occasionally i'll be chatting to someone that hasn't met askim yet and when they ask his name i have my little laugh but other than that it's a dead joke. 
well, i just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. an elderly lady asked askim's name, said ""what?"" so i repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. i quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they ""heard about my joke"" and that they didn't appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

i honestly don't get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog's dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction i'll accept your judgement on it.

edit: it's a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, i'll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

i should have been clearer, but i guess i didn't know how to spell it out until i saw you guys suggest it. i absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that i made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought i did that intentionally. this is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

the truth is that i say the word ""askim"" multiple times a day. i'm aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it's just a thing i call my dog. when going out i'm not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and i wasn't trying to trick her, it was small talk and i didn't even  think about it until i got a negative reaction. 

it's been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and i know from personal experience that it's very true. i really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community facebook page, especially now that i know it's turkish meaning and that it's a town in norway and neighborhood in sweden.",3
"not caring about or accommodating for my roommate's girlfriend's baby. i (27f) and my roommate (23m) rent from our landlord (60m) and are both on the lease. recently my roommate started dating a woman (19f) with a kid (toddler). 

both the woman and the kid are really annoying. i'm childfree and dislike being around children. this annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. i could deal with this until now. roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). i am very vocally not happy with this and i told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. it's been a month so i'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

best thing i can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. i don't acknowledge the kid, i bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, i moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since i hate going out there now anyway. apart from that business is completely normal. i smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as i do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who i have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as i want during non-quiet hours. i refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. one time i was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. i saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. i lied and said i was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

roommate's girlfriend hates me and thinks i'm being selfish. thinks that the baby needs to come first. she has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks i should be responsible for childproofing the house. i told her to take it up with the landlord and that i wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

today i was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that i'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". am i really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house? the way i see it she should go find some other place or if she can't afford one a shelter somewhere.",3
"if i tell my stepdaughter and my wife that i don't want to use the investments i made for my late daughter to finance her college education?. my daughter passed away 6 years ago fighting a rare genetic condition. the condition was also responsible for my late wife's death when my daughter was only an infant. i don't want to discuss anything related to that now. let me talk about the issue at hand. 

i'm now married to my amazing wife. i have a stepdaughter who will be starting high school shortly. i made a lot of investments for my late daughter. i thought i could give her a head start in life. but that never happened. so i decided to donate the money to a charity ( which helps kids with  genetic disorders ). the investments i made mature in an year and i plan on donating all of it. 

now my wife wants me to use the money for my stepdaughter. she tells me that this will help her have a head start in life and that would partially fulfill the purpose of the investments. she thinks this will also help us finance her college education. she doesn't want her getting bogged down by loans, which is a sound argument. i love my stepdaughter, but i don't think i'm ready to do this. i want to donate the money. here?",3
"for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?. the setup: i've known this guy for a couple years and we've worked together occasionally. we've had a couple dates before. we split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

he snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. i say sure.

i forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point i replied ""pizza and a movie"" and he replied ""yeah see you soon!"" it was just an innocent phrase but i didn't eat that day and assumed we'd get food together.

i show up and he has the movie. i say ""so are we getting food?"" 

he says ""i already ate. but i'm sure you have apps on your phone if you want something."" then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

i sit there awkwardly. this guy previously talked about being a men's rights guy. a normal one, not an incel dickhead. he also mentioned he's low on cash. but isn't it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? if he was too broke i'd obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn't the vibe i got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

he returns and turns on the tv and turns off all the lights. then he goes into the kitchen, which i assume is to get alcohol. 

i call out casually ""what do you got to drink?"" 

he calls back ""do you like tap water?""

this is not some red pill bullshit. i know this guy, he's serious. there's nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

i call out, ""yeah, sure.""

he brings me back a glass of tap water. he winks at me.

i'm starving. i haven't eaten since 8am. 

i say ""hey, i don't wanna be weird, but i thought we were getting pizza."" 

he says in a sympathetic tone, ""oh. i see. you must have been confused. you mentioned the food, not me. i should have cleared that up, i ate earlier. sorry if that wasn't clear. we can still get a pizza if you want. just pick anywhere nearby and order it.""

this is still kind of shitty to me, but i ignore it and order one large pizza. the pizza shows up. i eat two slices of it. the rest of it sits there the entire movie. he doesn't offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. he tries to make out with me during the movie. i stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

after the movie, i decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. i tell him my feelings and how he's weird with money and i'm uncomfortable. he feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. there was no bad intention at all. no red pill, no plan, nothing. just a dude who didn't think my pizza was his responsibility. 

then he asks me to have sex with him.

i decline. knowing we still have to work together, i manage to tiptoe out the door.

i don't expect or need people to buy me things, but i think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (and then they can offer to split the tab)

"for being upset about my wife selling her engagement ring?. i got engaged to my wife when we were 26, we had been dating for 7 years.

i got her engagement ring engraved to say ""semper amemus"" which means let us always love, i spent all my savings on her engagement ring and even took a loan out to buy it, it seems silly now but i love her and she deserves the best.


we got married at 30, adopted our first child at 32, second child at 35 and now we're both 40.

she's telling me she's got a bunch of pictures of it and she isn't a jewellery person anyway which is true in all the years i've known her she's only worn her crucifix and engagement/wedding ring, the wedding ring means everything to her but she doesn't have any attachment to the engagement ring.

"for asking my wife for an abortion.. me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. we're not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn't have kids.

now i've been putting off getting a vasectomy, i did get one a few weeks ago but i was just procrastinating it which was my fault i guess. however i used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. so about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and i realized that i'd ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she's on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. i go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything's all good.

nope. she's now six weeks pregnant, i was surprised cause isn't she supposed to be on birth control? come to find out that she hasn't been taking it for at least a few months now. on top of that, she wants to keep the kid which i am very against, she's very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she's against having kids too. i feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows i'm very against kids and not only that but i was a foster child and don't know anything about my parents so i have no clue what inheritable diseases i may have. 

i really don't want to have a kid. so much so that i'm thinking of divorcing her if she's not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest i might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

i have told her that i'm against this pregnancy but i haven't pushed any further than that. would i be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",3
"for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a japanese sauna?. i am a 20 y/o girl. i am in japan on exchange with some friends of mine. most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. she was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. however, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or japanese bath house. basically, you are expected to get completely naked. everything is gender segregated. there is a separate men's section and women's section.

my friend who is trans also wanted to go. so we all went as a group. everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but i think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. finally, when we were in the changing rooms, i quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

she asked me why and i told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. she got mad at me and said sarcastically, ""thanks for your concern."" in the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said i was out of line for suggesting it. they both thought it was none of my business. i explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that i'm just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

they avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. there were some looks but not as bad as if she didn't wear a towel.

i apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said i meant no disrespect. but she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that i am transphobic, although i do not believe that i am. aita?",3
"for accusing my brother of replacing my wife's refrigerated breast milk with cow milk?. my wife and i had our first baby a month ago. she prefers to pump a few bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. she stores the bottles in the fridge. 


my little brother has never had a girlfriend. he acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what i've seen. he came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


yesterday, my wife and i, along with our baby, went over to my parent's house. my brother knows since he's in our family group chat. he texted me when i was at my parent's house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. he knows my front door pin to get in. 


when i got home i saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. my wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. she coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. so, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. she told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. that bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.


my wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. i agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. i thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. 


i called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn't wait a few hours until we got home. he said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. i asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife's breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. i told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. he said he really doesn't know, but i could hear the tremble in his words. i told him that my wife and i don't believe him and if he doesn't apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. he once again denies doing anything so i hung up. 


before calling my parents, i want to know what you guys think first. are my wife and i just paranoid or do we have good enough reason to believe my brother swapped out her breast milk with cow milk?",3
"for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?. my wife and i have one 14 yo adopted daughter, sarah, which is relevant to the story. we recently found out that she has pcos, which i'd never heard of before. part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. the surgery is scheduled and happening soon. right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

between this illness and life in general, sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. today at church, some woman decided that sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her chance at a free baby. sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

my wife thinks that sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. i don't agree.

first off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if sarah was pregnant? infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. i recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. with her medical problems, sarah will probably be infertile herself, which i think puts her on par on that point. secondly, sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. i don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. i've had physical fights over less. maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

for letting our daughter get off scot free?

ninja edit: sarah will have to be on oral birth control for her entire life, and may actually lose at least one ovary in this surgery. i'd say she qualifies for infertility on those grounds. i don't know how it wouldn't.",3
"for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?. throwaway because my sister knows my reddit. 

i'm getting married next year and i'm so excited about it. my fiance has all his groomsmen picked out, and i'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. i'd also have liked to include my twin cousins e and a in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. a is a guy and lives a few hours away. e is ftm, which i'm sad to say plays a major role in this aita. 

i drove out two weeks ago to visit a and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. i put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""will you be a part of my bride tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. he was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and e's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. i specifically asked him not to mention anything to e because i wanted it to be a surprise.

fast forward to this weekend and i meet e for lunch. i give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. e's reaction didn't go as i expected. he got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. i tried to explain that i'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but i didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. i feel like he went off the deep end. he called me bigoted, asked why i wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. he left without giving me a chance to really explain.

i guess today e finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. i drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. my fiance says i should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think i'm being to harsh on e and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. she says i should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. she says i should give e a second chance and if i don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

would i be the asshole if i refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

eta: 
wow, i cannot believe how much this blew up. so i'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

e sent me a text apologizing. his apology was for ""snapping at me"". he admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to a he knows what i meant and would be in the wedding party ""if i'd have him"". nothing specific was mentioned, and i haven't sent any response yet. 

a also did call me this evening, but i was out to dinner and missed his call. i called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

also, e is a man. he uses the pronouns he/his/him. just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give anyone license to misgender him. if you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for e.",3
"for walking into my flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave?. i (20m) live in a flat with 5 others at university. there is one girl (20f), who's a bit of a...problem

she always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. very loud. and it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. we told security and they didn't do shit.

so we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. and yesterday, she does it again, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. we're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

i have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

i had had enough. i banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. i bang again and she doesn't open. so i try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

so i walk in and see them having sex. they both quickly see me and freak out. she says to me ''what the fuck?!!'' but i look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

she keeps saying ''what the fuck?!! get out!!'' and i say to her ''i've had enough of your fucking shit. we've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. we're trying to sleep''. 

the guy is standing there awkwardly so i tell him ''get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so i tell him ''i'll fucking call security, and i've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

so the ''problem'' girl starts crying and i tell her that she needs to sort her life out, i then to say to her ''please leave this flat, move out. no one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

i then leave and go to back to my room. i told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else i could have done. in fact they thanked me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, aita?

**to those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's not true. aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**to the people telling me that i should have spoken nicely to her, i said in the first few paragraphs i already did this. me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. what she did was say ''okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. i'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",3
"for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?. just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. i feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

i just had a baby on july 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. i know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like i have to entertain also. it would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that i expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). she also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores i could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

she texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. this is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and i'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. i wrote her back and told her that i'm really not up for visitors this week because i'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. she hasn't talked to me since yesterday after i wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. here?",3
"for feeding my vegan nephew meat?. my sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. he has been vegan since birth. my nephew and son attend the same school so i pick them up from school everyday. my nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

i usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. a couple of months ago i left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. i provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. i told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. his friends share their meals with him sometimes. i thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

so basically i continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. usually he goes for the non vegan one. maybe because because he never gets to at home. i know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. she's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which i completely understand and respect. my husband thinks iata for not telling her and being dishonest, but i think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year).

"if i kick my boyfriend out of my house over chicken.. i love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. i moved into my current house last year after i got a dog, specifically because i wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. i bought her doggy door, and she loved it a few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. he eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. that was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. so then the chickens had monitored outside time. then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. he keeps her locked in her cage all day when i'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. she can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. he's even started scolding me even when i let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if i'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200b;

it's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. he doesn't even pay rent on my house. he refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. when i remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. when i suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

&#x200b;

at this point i think the only thing i can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. i know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. if i asked him to move out?

edit: okay, wow, i got way more responses then i ever dreamed of. i've been trying to read through them all. i feel like despite most saying i would n be ta. i think i agree with the people saying that kicking him out is too extreme. my birthday is next week, i think i'm going to ask if we could build some sort of containment for the chickens for it. also, yes i know i am a human doormat. been my whole life, i'm working through it in therapy.",3
"update: for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?. link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aja1al/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_girlfriend_because/

so the general consensus was that i was being a raging asshole, though a few thought i was just ignorant. it's been a while since i made that post, and my own conclusion is that i am probably both.

i've done a lot of thinking about my behavior that week and i've realized a lot of things. this isn't something that i wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like i was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and i had been in a terrible mood. i wasn't acting like myself at all. instead of coping in a healthy way, i'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

the date wasn't really for her, it was for me, and that's what i'd been trying to avoid thinking about. i was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that i was just upset because this problem had happened before. the truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. i was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

that was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

i apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem i asked her if she had pcos or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

we went to have her examined and it turns out that she has pcos, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. so yeah, i felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. she'll be getting regular treatment from now on so i'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

tldr; i was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has pcos. thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. thanks for the help, reddit.",3
"for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his autism?. my sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. to make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and i had my son pass them out friday. we invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). except for one child well call david. 

the school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. david is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. from what i know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and i have nothing against either of them. however, there have been incidents with david before. last year through friends i had heard that david had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. i don't know if i believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. there are other logistical problems as well (the party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end i decided to not invite david. 

well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. this got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. she told me that i am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. when i brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. i woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her.

"for /how/ i told someone i would not give up my handicap spot?. this is a throwaway account.

&#x200b;

for background, i (22f) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess i have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, i had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. though, i have a handicap placard not just because i had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

i'm not asking for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what i said. my brother thinks i went too far, but i think i afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200b;

i was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) i pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. we waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. i got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200b;

the woman immediately started berating me, saying i had no right to use the handicap spot as other people ""that actually need it"" would be unable to park. apparently, i am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn't know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. she called me an entitled brat and accused me of ""scamming the government to support \my\ lazy ass,"" among other things. i told her a doctor saw fit i get a handicap placard, and when she said i look ""fine"" i told her that my medical history is none of her business. she continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200b;

i eventually had enough and let her have it. i told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn't eat yourself into debilitating obesity others 'that actually need it' would be able to use your spot. she tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which i cut her off to say if she's going to make assumptions about me i will do the same. i called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. she threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and i told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200b;

when my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. he said something like calm down and let's go inside, and i said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. she either didn't call the police or they refused to come.

i know what i said was harsh but i'm pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. maybe i should regret it, but i don't have an ounce of remorse for what i said. aita?",3

____________________

i (28f) am marrying my fiance (32m) in march.

i was in my parents home recently and i was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. for some background. this male friend, we'll call him stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. my fiance said he'd love to have stephen as a groomsman, and i asked stephen and he was delighted!

then, i told my parents, and they were like ""oh we didn't realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. she'll be in all the photographs, we don't think that's appropriate""  so i was obviously instantly mad.they then said that they weren't going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that i would need to remove stephen from the wedding party if i wanted them to come to the wedding. 

so i basically told them that if they weren't comfortable they didn't have to come. i left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. i then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if i remove stephen. basically bribing us. i just told her i needed space and i hung up.

that was 3 days ago and i haven't spoken to them. i'm shocked because they have never spoken ill of stephen before,! i'm upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. i am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think i would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

i don't know if i should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if i should leave it to them. a few people i've spoken to have said i'm being a bit of an asshole because they're my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it's something i don't agree with. that i'll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. i've had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and i'm being selfish. a cousin texted me to say that i'm choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won't be attending if my parents aren't, and the same for other members of the family. so it's basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

my view is that i don't think it's selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone i love. i feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

also to be clear i am 100% not removing stephen from my wedding or taking the money, i'm not considering either option (my fiance is in full agreement). but i just want to know if i'm the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won't be coming to my wedding?",3

today at lunch though i had enough.  she was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  ""are you sure you're not trans?  i've never heard of a guy being anorexic.""  and then, ""it's not attractive. just being honest.""   so i said, ""you're not just being honest, you're being a bitch.""  she asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  and i was like, ""no one thinks you're funny.  the only thing that's funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  take a look at yourself.""

"if i cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?. using throwaway 


so as the title suggests, i'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. this abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and i used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because i'm set to win in a few months.



now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after i adopt our kid.



when i told her that i was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support i'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why i wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



for info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



so reddit, if i told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if i knew my wife was going to leave me after?


edit: wow this really blew up. to give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

yes i know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and i will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


edit 2: went out for a few drinks because i needed them because of all of this. 


wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


i was originally leaning towards adoption because i love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms i've decided to talk to a lawyer when i get home to make an informed decision.",3
"for getting annoyed with the a guy playing his guitar in a coffee shop?. i was sitting at a table in a coffee shop yesterday when this guy comes in to the shop carrying a guitar and orders a drink. he then happens to choose the space right next to my table to stand and play his guitar while waiting for his order. 

i find people who force their music on others very annoying. this guy and his guitar are no different from someone playing music from a bluetooth speaker in a public area in my mind. but i was lucky in this case - i didn't have to stick around. without speaking to the guy or even making eye contact, i stood up and moved to the complete opposite side of the shop to a new table by the exit. 

well the guy must have noticed my displeasure because he stopped playing after i moved. a few moments later he got his drink and moved towards the exit to leave. he opens the door to leave, pauses, then turns to me and says ""you could have just asked me to stop playing. treat me like a human being."" and then continued out the door before i could respond. 

so this guy is acting like i'm the asshole for not verbally engaging with a stranger who annoyed me. i feel like simply removing myself from the area when possible is usually the right play and leads to less conflict. aita?",3
"for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?. i (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that i can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

my 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. my sister and i have never really got on, when i got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks i force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). so, when i went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, i was shocked to find my sister there alone. i asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

my sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why i think this happened. i huffed because i was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. my sister rolled her eyes. i asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch tv until mom came back. my sister said 'absolutely not, i hate children and i don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

now, i completely understood this and i think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. i called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. my sister rolled her eyes and said 'fine, i'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. i was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. i didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

so i left, and went for the bus. literally five minutes later i get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the er because she cracked her head open on the living room table. apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

i am absolutely raging at my sister. i don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. she argues that i 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which i feel i didn't. she says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but i feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

"for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?. my daughter (28) has gotten into dps and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. she has been fostering this 8mo for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. my daughter hopes to keep foster child. 

i am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when i asked to confirm the size of bio child, she asked me about foster child. i told her i didn't think to include her because she's foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. she said all grandchildren should be included. my thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. that would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

she went off on me and hung up and i am sitting here feeling horrible. i did not mean i do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but i thought i had a clear thought process? 

aita?

edit: i do care about this child, i'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. i just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

final edit: i accept judgment and i commented on the person's comment that made me realize why i am in the wrong. they were to the point and just made it a simple question and i understood. 

i feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. i did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). maybe i should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, i apologize. 

accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. i am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - i'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

my daughter and i called her case manager and the photo idea including fc has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting fc or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why i was in the wrong.

another edit: i accept judgment as i said about my actions... but i stand by my matching flannel idea. you should try a cheesy matching shirt photo, they're goofy memories to look back on.",3
"if i (f28) got steralised against my fiance's wishes?. my fiance (31m) and i (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. last year i had a stillborn baby daughter. i said i never wanted to be pregnant again. it hit me really hard and i've never known pain like it. 

apparently, your super fertile after a loss and i ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and i'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. something my fiance really wanted.

i hate being pregnant. never enjoyed it. i hate even more how long i've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. i'm miserable and i never want to be pregnant again.

in the unlikely event the baby i'm carrying now does also die i never want to be pregnant again. if the baby lives i never want to be pregnant again. i honestly can't explain how much i hate being pregnant. i love babies, children etc. not pregnancy. my eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. i gave up work to be a sahm but i'm looking forward to when this one starts school and i can get back to work.
i hate how sick, tired and achey i feel. i'm short tempered with my other children. i'm fat and saggy. i poop constantly. my mental healths taken a complete beating - i've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. 

anyway. my consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. i said yes of course, just check with my fiance.
he is very against it. i don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if i fall pregnant again. 

he says i'm making a decision based on anger that's i've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

if i agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what i want?

also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

edit: this has gotten more attention than i thought it would. i haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. i wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. i always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. we had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

this past year he's been my absolute rock. he also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while i fell apart. he's a fantastic father. this isn't a walk away from our family matter.

he's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and i accept that. he has so many other fantastic qualities. an example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. he simply refused to pick. it upset him too much. you could say this is an ass hole move, however while i sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

i know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but i didn't want relationship advice. i just wanted to know if i would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

if i say i'm getting it done, he won't stop me. but he will resent me. if i don't get it done, i will resent him. 

his main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. second that i'm not my usual self (i'm not - i am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however i have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. forth is my age. 

and i've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. i have my third c section booked for the end of the month. i need to give an answer on wednesday if i want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. i wanted to see if i was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
so far it seems from comments that i'm not and i really appreciate all the replies. i will read them all xxx

edit 2. guys i was asking if i would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and i'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. i'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. we love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. whilst i'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. everything he does is for us. he's hardworking, loving and fun. he helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. he does baths and the park. he rubs my back, sends me off for baths when i ache. let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. we survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. we can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",3
"for ""allowing"" my 16yo daughter to get a tattoo?. my daughter is 16, and will be 17 in august.  in september, i'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting college at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated hs a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200b;

last week my daughter graduated hs.  we packed up her room (the essentials) from her mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her college dorm.  a few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  i was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. it was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. we stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  the next day we went to tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  i've known tony since high school, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  i completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  he even did my first tattoo when we were in high school.  the entire experience was actually a blast for me.  i haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  to see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200b;

of course the next day she posts pics online, and her mom flips her shit.  she calls me screaming about how irresponsible i am.  i honestly didn't know her mom wouldn't be ok with it.  she has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and i'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  she's also cut me out of multiple milestones in daughter's life.  graduations, performances, games, etc.  until daughter was old enough to tell me directly, i was never invited so i missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200b;

obviously daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""i'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  i definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  wife has been ok with her having sex since 13, picked her own high school and college, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200b;

mom is livid.  she threatened to call the police.  threatened to pick up daughter and bring her back to her house.  tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  none of this is happening.  a culture was created in which i don't get input on things regarding daughter.  a culture was created in which mom allowed daughter to make decisions for herself.  here for not double checking with mom that a tattoo is ok?",3
"for eating my all of wife's toblerone, then buying a new one?. yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a toblerone from his holiday in switzerland. she agreed i could have some so i did. she's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so i ate the rest of an almost full packet.

she has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so i assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. fuck, it was already gone, so i've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that i'm a dead man when she gets back. 

she once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so i'm not taking chances.

toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. not sure if i should put it in the swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that i bought i new one. for now i'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. i'm in the uk btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in switzerland.

aita?

also, she religiously reads this sub, so if she comes across this - g, i love you and i hope you forgive me like you did with the pasta.

"for telling my girlfriend that if she wanted to be a surrogate for a friend of hers that i no longer wanted to continue the relationship?. my long time girlfriend told me recently that she is interested in being the surrogate for a child for a friend of hers who is gay and wants a child of his own.

i respect her desire to help and i told her: ""this is your body, and i don't think i have a say in what you can or can't do with it. that being said, if you want to be the surrogate for him, i don't think i would want to continue this relationship any further.""",3
"for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?. about a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (i'll call anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. she received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). she had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. i was devastated to  hear her go through this.  despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

after months of visiting anna, sitting by her, i was getting drained. her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that i shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (i am 20yo). so after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in god, i put myself back out there. i eventually met a new girl who i loved (katie), and i saw a lot of traits in her that i saw in my ex. 

a few days ago (may 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. at first i was extremely upset, but realized anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). katie knew about anna and it was no surprise to her i wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. when i got there, i kissed anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her i loved her. after the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. i kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""i love you). 

at the funeral i gave her a eulogy (which katie attended) and told anna again ""i love you.""

after the funeral, katie was angry with me. she asked what i mean't when i said ""i love you, anna."" then i told her about the kiss  because i felt guilty. now, katie is now super pissed at me. she is staying with her parents and said i cheated on her. this was not my intention at all though, i just wanted anna to know (if she was even conscious) that i loved her, and would see her again. the kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, i wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

"for not caring when my friend came out of the closet?. my friend is obviously gay. he does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on youtube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. he also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up k-pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

we (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

so we're at school, it's lunchtime and we're all chilling in the cafeteria. he suddenly comes out of the closet and announces (to the guy-table) that he's gay. we're playing cards at the time, and our responses ranged from: ""cool,"", to ""finally...,""

well apparently, we didn't show enough support because he seemed upset that we weren't caught completely by surprise.

him: why can't you people just accept me for who i am?

(we stare at each in confusion)

me: uh... we don't care. you're gay? fine. it's none of our business. (shrug)

him: it's 2019. it's not okay to hate on gay people anymore. (he storms off)

girl 1: (kicks my leg) what the hell's your problem?

me: everybody already knew he was gay.

girl 1: soooo??? you could've showed that you were happy for him! god! (kicks my leg again)

me: kick me again, i dare you. (spoiler: she doesn't)

the guys at the table give me a mixed bag of: ""you done fucked up now boi /s"" and ""shut up, let's play. lunch is almost over""

"for refusing to allow my daughter to participate in high school cheerleading?. i have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  both of them have always been bookworms.  very studious and cerebral, just like their dad.  i also played sports all through school and i value the experience that brings.  i've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  i tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  we dont know til we try?  even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   my wife insisted i back off.  fair enough.  

&#x200b;

now my daughter is entering high school and wants to become a cheerleader.  she has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  she actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  but one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  she's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in high school because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

&#x200b;

i said no.  i dont appreciate that reasoning.  my wife explained that i dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and i say ok?  hows that relevant?  i also dont appreciate cheerleading.  its too dangerous.  girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  we don't have the insurance to cover it.  lastly, i dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  my wife says i'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  most girls dont get injured.  i'm the pervert because i'm making it sexual.  i pushed for her to join a sport.  i let my son play sports.  she'll have a much better high school experience.

"for putting my foot down and not allowing my mother in law to come to christmas.. my mother in law is a horrible person who loves to create drama whenever she can. 

last christmas we got both of our kids different gifts as one was a 13 year old girl and one is a 10 year old boy. 
my mil (mother in law) decided to tell my daughter that she didn't get as many gifts as my brother and that we spent less on her. 
basically trying to get our daughter to believe that we loved her less. 
we then had to deal with a crying 13 year old on christmas. 

she has also brought super expensive gifts for people specifically to upstage everyone, she will even make a point of mentioning how much it is in front of people. 

she called up to ask what we will be doing for christmas as it's our turn, i mentioned that me and my wife want to have a potluck at our place. 
she then proceeded to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)

she came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. i was really pissed. my sister and my family supported me. but my wife did not. she later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer.

"for not going to my sisters wedding because of the ridiculous ""requirements"". so, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.

&#x200b;

my sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. i haven't been involved in the planning as i have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. my sister want's a ""fancy"" wedding and is micro-managing everything. i have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200b;

in my opinion i think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. at least until yesterday. a email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". these requirements were a joke. some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. but some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. the worst though were the ""gift requirements"". according to the email a gift of 300$ value or more must be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. the email also ends with ""those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200b;

this is a joke, right? like i can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. i called my mom to make sure this was not a late april fools joke and it was real. i told her that i won't be going because of this. that was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that i'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:. my parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. my parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but i still think that all of these rules are a joke.

"for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?. my husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as an. an's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. an is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

an stays mostly with us because i am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. it had always been my husband who pays for an's expenses.

when an turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(hs) in the big city we live in. we checked on hs and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private hs. she has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. i have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

my husband and i came to an agreement that i would also help her dream to come true, but i would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (an did not know this) and he agreed. this conversation took place two years ago... and now, an is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

i laid some facts down to an, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. i recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

an's mom is ecstatic and so is her grandma. they have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". i think they're absolute loonies; i bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. i believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

i am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money i've been saving in other stuff if an decides to carry on with the pregnancy. i have not and will not make the ultimatum of ""terminate or i'll stop paying your tuition"", but i will tell her that i won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. i don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. i firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. money will go to some of the child's expenses and i will give no more. an can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

my husband is telling me i need to understand the situation. i do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill i will die on. i can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but i feel like i'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something i shouldn't. husband firmly believes i am doing this to punish an and i am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. aita?

&#x200b;

**edit/commonly asked questions:** ann will not stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. i will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but i also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (i still need to make a budget, but i don't think i will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

no, i will not make an ultimatum. i haven't spoken to ann about this situation. i plan on telling her i can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. she still will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. if father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

i will definitely not pay for the private university. the country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. i am not closing her educational options. i may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to lse, for example) but i am not giving her the worst.

finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. that would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**another edit because forgot to add:** ann was supposed to be on the pill. gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. she stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. husband and i have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but i'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point i just want to fist fight bio mom.",3
"for teasing my wife about finally catching her shitting?. ok so this is kind of a weird situation. my wife is one of those super prim and proper chicks. like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. you don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. i've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

she had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. she wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so i had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", i'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

well she had been in there for a while, and i'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. so i went in there and sure enough she was. i teased her and was like, ""see! i knew you shit too!"" she got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so i left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. she was real emotional so i shut up about it for a while. well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so i figured i could finally tease her again.

every once in a while i'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and i'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" she always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when i brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. i told her it's just funny because it's the only time i got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. but i kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said i was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. so aita? i'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

she is a little snarky, but i had no issue with it. until i caught her calling ally ""cinderella"" and ""princess."" she was also ordering ally to get her coffee. when ally said she was working on something, belladonna told her ""well, i guess you just sit down and do nothing then.""   
i fired her on the spot.   
my mother thinks i was an asshole for doing that. but i don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. i told people what ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. she was simply my niece assisting me on stuff i needed help with.

"aita? i (21f) just had an abortion and my bf (29m) thinks i'm overreacting. hi all, i'll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
i  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( i'm on the pill and he wears a condom). i have no idea what happened but i still managed to get pregnant. i immediately decided to get an abortion.
i asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. he said he didn't want to take a day off. full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

so whatever, he told me he wasn't coming and that i had to take care of it. this was a week ago. the procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. i went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. i thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as i just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
he then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
so i immediately started bawling because i just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn't wanted and i don't regret it, but it doesn't mean i feel sensitive about it). he became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that i was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. he didn't apologize and we went to bed upset. i woke up in the middle of the night because i was cramping and sore, so i went on his couch and had a good cry. apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if i was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights asap because i was being inconsiderate.

aitah? i feel like he doesn't give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it's the 'pregnancy hormones' making me whiny.

eta: thank you all for your judgement and messages. i'm going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. to those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn't want it. regardless, i want to at least understand his motivations. i will try to post an update when this is all over. thank you again.
also don't waste your time calling me a baby killer, i'm 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. if you can't understand why, then you're not someone i want to engage with anyway.",3
"for subjecting my boyfriend to my nakedess?. i (32f) live with my boyfriend (35m) of 5 years. we live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. as a result, our dresser is in the living room.

after work, i like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. while i'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. well today, i started telling him about an annoying co-worker while i was topless. out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". i was really taken aback by this. embarrassed, i went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

angrily, i came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. before i get into his reasoning, i will admit that i am naked quite a bit. for instance, after i shower i like to do a naked kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. he even mentioned that this issue came up in seinfeld and that jerry would side with him. i don't know about this, i feel like i have a right to be naked, but i don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

anyway, should i let my fur flag fly or aita??

update: before i dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! thank you! ok, so after this incident i decided to cool off and go to the gym. when i got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. i coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. while i'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! he gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! i watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. he then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when i'm naked. i understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. tough, but fair.

thank you again for your helpful comments! they were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how i was making him uncomfortable. in terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. i accept this.

i'm also a bit obsessed with all the seinfeld comments. jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. now kramer on the other hand...

and thank you to everyone who supports my kermit dance! i will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. but for no longer than 5 minutes. i know the rules.",3
"for specifically ordering food my wife hates so i don't have to share?. yeah so i'm basically joey from friends before anyone states the obvious. i really really hate sharing food when i order out at restaurants or takeout. i always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

so my wife is a terrible food snatcher. she always says she's not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food i've ordered. so many times i've ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. i ask her to order her own stuff but she'll say she's not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

anyways in the past year i've found a good trick where i simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won't touch any of it. recently some family members discovered i do this and called me a massive asshole. they called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly i'm just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. aita?

**edit**: to those asking if i've told her to stop, i do, all the time, but it's honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. or she'll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly ""so how's your food? it looks really good..."" or she waits until i'm taking a break to ask me multiple times if i've finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she's begging for scraps. it just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

i like just getting something she has no interest in cause then i can eat in peace, and that usually forces her to order something else for herself as well.",3
"for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us?. my husband and i have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. it took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. with that in mind, my husband and i came to his sister (sarah) with a proposal.

sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. my husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. with that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

we invited sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. we told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. we told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

sarah exploded at us. she said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. she actually left early. right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. my husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind sarah's difficulties. my parents think she is behaving awfully. most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much sarah hates kids.

it's really weighing on my mind and i honestly never expected this kind of outcome. she literally blocked us on every platform she could. are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",3
"update: for being upset that my siblings are getting my part of an inheritance but i'm not because i'm a recovering addict?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c76v9p/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_siblings_are_getting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

my first post wasn't hugely popular but i wanted to update anyways.

after what happened with my parents, i won't lie, i relapsed. 

i had a weekend where i blacked out. i remember getting back to my apartment and all the drugs and booze i had bought was gone. and it was a monday morning. it was a lot of stuff. 

i scared myself so much i ended up calling my parents saying that they were right and i remembered everyone's advice on my last post and i apologized for how i treated them and that they were right in not giving me any of their money. 

i'm now three weeks sober and i took reddit's advice and made a compromise with my parents in regards to my inheritance.

if i remain at least 5 years sober and submit to a bi monthly drug test, they will reconsider my part of the money. i hope they do reconsider. 

i know i have a lot of work to do and i still have a lot of selfishness to overcome but i wanted to thank everyone for helping me try to realize that.

"for refusing to get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name even though i have one of my sons name?. i have a tattoo of my sons name which i got when he turned 1. i've never had a tattoo after that. met the love of my life 22 years ago, she had a 4 year old daughter, and i honestly truly love her like my own. 

recently my wife's best friend noticed my tattoo (it's on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if i had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

my wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. she told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that i should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

i don't want to do it at all, and i keep saying no, but my wife thinks a 'real dad' would get tattoos of both. i got a bit upset at that comment and told her i was a real bloody dad. i asked my daughter and she said 'i don't want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me i want you to get a cat' .... i love her very much but i'm not getting a freaking cat on me either. 

my wife is very sensitive about the fact that our daughter isn't biologically mine, i absolutely 0% care as my stepfather raised me and he is the best dad in the fucking world. i love my daughter and she loves me.

am i the asshole for refusing to get this tattoo?

edit: a user pointed out i should explain why i got my tattoo. i got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn't was a medical miracle. i was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",3
"for telling strangers that my wife and i are married?. my wife gets upset when i do this but i feel like i'm in the right here. if we are at a bar or a party, we usually go our own separate ways to socialize. i'll notice that she'll be talking to a guy that neither of us have met before and i can see on his face that he's into her. so i'll head over to where she's at and grab her, give her a kiss and compliment her. something like ""she's so funny. that's why i married her."" then i leave so she can continue talking. almost every time, the guy ends up leaving after i do. she's never really flirting with these guys, just talking sports or politics. but she's beautiful and very smart and she has a knack for being very personable so they assume she is flirting. she says all she is trying to do is have a conversation with a stranger but i'll i'm doing is letting people know we are married. if it was just a conversation, they should still be able to talk to her even though she's taken. aita?",3
"for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?. so this happened about a year ago but i'm curious. my wife said i drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

so my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. so i was excited too and asked him what. he said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

i felt a little bad but said to him ""you know i was told that as a kid too, but i've learned that's actually not true."". i said i can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. we get home and i show him and he believes me. 

the next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. his teacher tells him no, i am the one who is wrong not him. my kid even said he believes his teacher. so i show my son more proof that i am right, but he is still skeptical.  

the next day i compose a nice email, not rude. simply stating i told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him i am incorrect. i give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

he emails me back saying i am still incorrect. at this point my wife asks me to drop it. i am upset and i don't want to drop it. as of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

so i email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because i cannot produce anything showing he is correct. he finally relents and says i must be right. 

but at this point, i now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  my wife asked me to please stop but i didn't. i emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

he did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

now i feel that i have taught my son a few good lessons.  a) it's ok to question things including those authorities b) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence c) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

was i an asshole for dragging it out?

edit. to those calling me an asshole? what is the best way to handle this then? i'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

edit: well this blew up. i'll accept my nta. but these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? nope. couldn't care less. but i wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

final edit: showed the wife this. she said that i was correct in following through. but i was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days.

"for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when i am a woman. i am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years i have had a short, men's style haircut. i'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. my sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. it usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. during that time every salon i've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. this has always annoyed me and i don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

recently i moved and yesterday i went to a new shop for my monthly trim and i decided to try something new. i asked if i could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. the woman at the counter looked like i slapped her. she called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. they talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. i pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and i ended up leaving. i was never rude or mean, but i still feel bad that i wasted a stylist's appointment.

for asking? leaving? being annoyed at what i see as a double standard?

i've thought about going to a barber, but i live in a conservative part of the country and i worry about a negative reaction there and every salon i've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well.",3
"for forbidding my father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior. my father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives. he particularly disapproves of the fact that i work, send the kids to daycare, and expect my husband to contribute to the household equally in spite of the fact that he makes more than i do. if my father in law had it his way, i would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

his recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money. if i buy my husband a gift, fil says, ""is it really a gift if you're spending his money?"" if i pay for my fil's coffee, he says, ""well, really your husband is paying for this."" it's annoying and frustrating. i tried being snarky back, didn't work. i tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what i was talking about.

the final straw was that my kids have started saying it. i mentioned to my husband that i was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing. my husband told them that they were being rude and they defended themselves by saying that grandpa says it all the time! apparently he's taken to telling the kids behind my back that i'm wasting my husband's money on myself every time that i buy anything for myself. one of my kids straight up called me greedy and selfish.

i'm livid and i want to ban my father in law from seeing my kids until he admits to what he's been doing, apologizes, and actually stops doing it. my husband is onboard for the most part, but his mother and siblings are telling us that this is just how he is and it's not that bad and we can just teach our kids otherwise. are we assholes if we kick him out of our kids lives until he stops being such a jerk and poisoning my kids against me?",3
"for making a baby cry to save $100?. okay hear me out.

so today i took my baby over to my parents' house for dinner, without my wife. we have a five month old, she's home with the kid all day while i'm at work and needed a break—so i went with the baby. works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and i bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

on the way home, around 10pm, i made a left in a no left. it saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. it's a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and i get pulled over. here in ontario, 'disobey a sign' is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how i know…).

baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. so just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, i just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. baby woke up and starting screaming. when i rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

baby was perfectly fine. i gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. we're home now and she's asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. i felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so i moved $100 (what i would have paid for the ticket) into the kid's resp (university fund).

that said, i've always hated having friday night dinners with my in-laws. my in-laws are nasty judgemental people and for the last 10+ years i've spent almost every friday night - when i should be relaxing from a long week's work - with people that i honestly detest on some level. why do i do this? because it makes my wife happy and i want her to be happy.

so i told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that i'd also like to stop doing something which i hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.

what made me mad was that from time to time my mom (f59) makes comments about how she raised my sister and i as a single parent. i disagree and tell her that she raised us half of the time while the other half we were raised by our dad (m58). she then says that he didn't do much and that we were raised by a single mom who did everything for us.

"for refusing to meet my half sister who was a result of my dads affair?. mom and pops were married for 30ish years. i'm 26. always thought they were a dream couple until 5 years ago when i found out that my dad had fathered a child from an affair that he had in 2006. 

my mom went batshit crazy when she found out, i honestly believe her mental health cracked and deteriorated from then and she divorced my dad and moved to the other side of the us. essentially, i lost my mom to my dads idiocy, she is *not* the same woman as she used to be. 

my dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years i guess because he had no one to keep it a secret from he's more or less a full time dad to her. 

since the divorce i've kept my distance from him, i'm just trying to secure my bag , live quietly and stay away from drama. 

he has lately started up this crusade of me meeting this girl and developing a brotherly bond with her. i told him it's just not on the cards, i have no interest in picking up a relationship with anybody and i have my own hatred for my fathers new family and idc what anyone says, therapy ain't fixing that. believe me, i've tried. it's better for my mental health if i continue to do my thing and not involve myself. 

it's got to a point where everyone on my paternal side is bugging me for some sort of christmas miracle meet up, apparently this girl wants to know me very much and is begging that she gets to meet me as a christmas present. i've consistently told everybody 'no' and i'm also not celebrating christmas with them in case they try force anything.

"for not wanting to pay for a diamond ring?. so my girlfriend and i recently got engaged, and i figured it would be nicer to have her pick out her own ring rather then me guessing what she likes. 
now i already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. personally i don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. so instead i offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. i do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. but she thinks i'm being stingy for not buying her a ""real"" diamond. we've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now i wanted to ask you guys if i should just suck it up or not.",3
"for objecting to ""female employee only"" parking spaces at my workplace?. so theres not too much to say, i guess i'm more curious in others opinions on this.  i am an approx 22.5 year old man, i recently snagged a really really good job.  i work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  it's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). i would also like to preface the following with saying that i work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. 

about a week ago i was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and i was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  as my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, i thought to myself ""woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?"" so i started reading it and i was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  basically, it read as follows ""female employee parking space only!"" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  

now, let me clarify i am not ""irate"" or ""fuming"" about it, but i dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  i even asked my fiance when i got home, just to get a female insight on it.  she said she thought it was stupid.  i guess i'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  just my two cents on it though.

"for changing my mind midway through buying a stranger coffee?. i stopped by a local coffee place after work today. there was a woman behind me in line with a toddler, the kid was sweet and saying ""hello"" to everyone in line and genuinely brightened my day. 

while i was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. i kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, ""in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.""

i was so taken aback, i immediately told the cashier that i changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. i walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. 

for reneging on my offer? 

edit: i want to thank everyone so much for responding. the only thing i'd like to clarify is that i felt bad about it afterwards. she could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. i didn't communicate with her very well because i fell into a trap of assuming the worst. if she looked at me expectantly to pay, i would clearly not be an asshole. it was more my quick response of which i was unsure.

"for telling a ""friend"" that at least ""my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons"" over a joke she made?. i'm a ""small"" chested woman. not even that small, i like my boobs. there is this ""friend"" of mine who has like f cup breasts. 

for some reason, she likes picking on my breasts. she is always saying passive aggressive stuff like ""well, it's not like you'll ever feel real back pain, considering how small your tits are"", one time she picked up my bra when we were in the changing room after gym and said ""do you really fit in this? god your tits are tinier than i thought!""; ""can you really not pick up stuff with your underboob? that's insane how small they are!""; ""how will you nourish kids if you ever have them lmao""; ""if i were your boyfriend, i'd be soooo unsatisfied with them"". 

i'm not really confrontational, i just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they're not funny. yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. i was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:

her: hey op, would you use shoes if you had no legs?
me: well, depends if i had prosthetics or not. 
her: but would you if you had no prosthetics? 
me: i don't think so, why? 
her: then why do you wear a bra? hahaha they are so small. 

i was tired at the moment. i admit i snapped, i told her ""at least my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons."" 

she got angry. like i just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. she started crying and saying i'm an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? 

my boyfriend thinks i was not an asshole and technically i wasn't talking about her tits so that's shit she took upon herself. some of our mutual female friends told me i should apologize, her boyfriend told me that's a sensitive subject for her and i should apologize. she sent me a text that she will be mad at me until i properly apologize to her. 

i don't want to apologize as i think i was not the asshole here. play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we'd say in my language, this woman ""se lleva y no se aguanta"".

i replied to her message saying that i would apologize if she did too. she told me she had nothing to apologize as i *don't have big tits nor suffer like her* bitch what. she also started bitching about my boyfriend and how he is a bad influence for me ???? no one even mentioned him. i think this bitch has a sick crush on me or has her head way up her ass so she tries desperately to not be the one in the wrong. 

i took advise from here too and told her to stop making comments about my breasts or i'd have to go to hr. you know, culturally (in my country) it's not that of an offense for women to speak about other women's breasts. she told me i was a crybaby and a weakass softie. 

i'll post screenshots (with translation) when i'm in my computer so i can edit that shit. thanks everyone for the support. ",3
"for telling my boss his ""time theft"" concerns are not my problem?. the computers at my job are fairly crappy and require several minutes to boot. after turning them on i have to wait a couple of minutes for them to get to the password screen, then a few more minutes before they're all loaded up and ready to go. typically i come in, turn them on, check my phone messages, hit the head (long commute to work) then get going. it's around 5 minutes max. 

&#x200b;

so this morning he calls a meeting and announces that going forward he wants everyone there 10 minutes before their required start time in order to boot their machines and starts citing how much this so-called ""time theft"" is costing him and etc. i replied that if he wants me to come in at 8:50 instead of 9 that's fine, but the ten minutes has to come off the end of the day unless he's going to pay the 50 minutes of ot a week. i also pointed out that when he opens the building at 8am he could spend two minutes turning on everyone's (three people) computers, which would cut the wait time in half at least. then i said that my time is as valuable to me as his is to him and even though it's ""just ten minutes"" they're my ten minutes, not his and i'm not interested in donating my time for nothing. 

&#x200b;

so he was all pissy all day and everyone else is acting like i'm the asshole but i vehemently disagree. they're work computers and turning them on is part of the job, whether he likes it or not. anyone else think he's the asshole here?",3
"for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. every summer my community has a cookoff competition. usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. it's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. this year it was pasta sauce. i've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and i moved here but this is the first time i entered as a competitor. it was earlier today.

one of the other competitors, i know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with asperger's syndrome and autism. i don't know much about this condition evidently. i'll call her jessica. i guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. we've never had this before as far as i know.

to make the story short, i won the competition. and $1,500. there's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. my wife and i were in shock because i like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? we were tickled pink. 

we celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. you might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". they said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. we obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. so they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with jessica. likewise we said no.

i guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. after a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

we had to leave and haven't collected our winnings yet. we're meant to tomorrow from the mayor's office. i can't even imagine what's going to happen tomorrow.

are we the assholes for not splitting our winnings with a disabled child for a cooking competition?",3
"for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?. last year i took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. i'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but i felt it was important. i should also note that i left the church of latter day saints (mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of utah. it's part of the reason i am divorced. 

anyway, last night i took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. i put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. in my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. the ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""nothing better than hanging out with the people i love."" i thought it was innocent enough. he never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

my sister is furious. she said that she should have been notified that he was dating. when i told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. here's the thing though. there is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. now that she knows he's gay i don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

i also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. i have legal guardianship over my nephew. he's living in my home. she kicked him out. she started crying after i said this and told my family so i've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person i am for saying that to my sister. i don't see it but maybe i'm wrong. should i have told her even though they aren't serious? was it a low blow to say the things i said to her? am i the asshole?

edit: thanks everyone. i feel like an asshole now for asking this question. it probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing i ever had to do and i think i still carry a lot of guilt from that. my kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. to have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. i don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

edit2: i completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. i want to be super clear that wasn't what i intended to do. when you grow up in the environment i did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. everything i did from the time i started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. going against my family automatically makes me feel like i am messing up. when i picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that i messed up. when i divorced my husband and left utah and my family stopped speaking to me, i thought i messed up. it has taken years to overcome what i have been taught and i am not a confident person. i let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. every decision i make is harder for me than it is for most people. i am sorry if anyone feels like i am being anything other than genuine.",3
"for not helping to pay for my sister's college, even though i could easily afford to?. i'm 29, my sister is 27.

we're polar opposites. i've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. my sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. she tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. she currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

on the other hand, i'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. naturally, my parents think i should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. they say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but i'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

i shut down the idea immediately. in my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. my gf and i plan on getting married soon and i don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

as you can imagine i'm now seen as the greedy brother who won't help out family... even though my sister has never done anything to help me.

so yeah, am i really the asshole here?",3
"for breaking up with my girlfriend over ""consent required""?. before any of you start freaking out at me, i want to say that i fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and i would never in my life think about treating another person that way. now that thats out of the way, the moment.  

i've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\~ months.  in this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  we've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  this goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   this has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  we've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.

now, on this last friday, i went over to her apartment.  we put on some stupid netflix documentary that i can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  i got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  i do the business and make her feel good.  after this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  i try to talk to her because i can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  i tell her that i know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then i should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.

""i just feel like you kind of use me.  you never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.""

now, of course i understand the sentiment.  i'm not always the most romantic of person, i try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but i can see where shes coming from.  still, i was \visibly confused\ at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that i never listen to her.

i point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  she gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  i tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  

at this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that i'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless i ask first and she gives me permission.

i say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like i'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because i want to touch the woman i've been dating for 8 months.

""well maybe you are!"" she says angrily.  at this point, i'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  i just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  she throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time i just leave and go home.

not five minutes after i walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, i think it over for a minute and decide that i'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.

&#x200b;

i woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because i ""broke up with the perfect woman because i wasn't allowed to grope her whenever i want.""

so, am i the asshole here?  i feel like i'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that i've missed?  am i the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  

&#x200b;

and before you start yelling at me (even though i'm sure half of you have already started typing) i respect a persons right to say no.  if i touch my girlfriend, or any girl i'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, i'll stop, no question.  i just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.

"for telling a 'homophobe' that i've seen his grindr account?. for the sake of convenience, i'll call homophobe 'j'.

j and i used to be friends in school, until i came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. he then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

years pass, and i'm scrolling through grindr when i spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. his profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

i think to myself ""oh, he came out, good for him."" then i look at his facebook. he's still spouting homophobia, sharing lgbt stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing lgbt people that he comes across online.

so, to tell him if i found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

edit: if i do tell him i've seen the account, it will be private through facebook or grindr. it isn't anybodies' place to publically out somebody that doesn't want to be out.",3
"for telling my husband i won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?. i have two children from a previous relationship. danielle (11) and elliot (7). my husband john loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, alicia, from a previous relationship. we've been married four years, but i've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to spain for three weeks. john was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. however, when he told alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which i did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

it all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, i couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. she then phoned up her mum crying saying i was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' she also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


we had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. she was cuddling with one of them, and when elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. as her guardian on the trip i was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. she threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if i won't let her have fun. 

finally, alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. i stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

when we got back i told john how difficult alicia had been throughout the trip and said that i wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. he insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but i insisted on speaking to alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. she defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. i was shocked, but after john and leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if i get to know her and things like that. 

i've not said that i'll never be in the same room as her again, i've just said that i won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but john says that i'm overreacting, and that i should give her another chance, which i have no intention of doing.

update: thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. while i still stand by my decision and won't take alicia on holiday unless john is there with me, a lot of people said that i haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), i think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. it is of course leanne's decision but it isn't something i'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. as some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why i told john that i will make the effort to get to know alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as i can.",3
"for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?. back in 2009 when the economy tanked i lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. basically everything. at first i didn't want anyone to know what had happened so i stayed at a friends house for a week while i looked for a new job. but his landlord told me guests couldn't stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. so i asked my mother if i could stay with her while i looked for a job. i told her i'd be on the street homeless if she didn't help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. fast forward 2 months, i've been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. even something like safeway or mcdonald's. my dad finds out that i'm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in nj and i accept. within a week i have a job and in 3 months i'm in my own place again. it's been 10 years since then and i haven't spoken to my mother because of what i perceive to be a betrayal. she attempts to contact me frequently and i ignore it. for cutting her out of my life? 

tl;dr mother let me be homeless and i never forgive her.

edit: i have already cut ties. i haven't spoken to her in 10 years. it's my siblings telling me that i am the asshole that prompted this post.

edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all i can say is what she said to me. she said she couldn't afford to let me stay. but all i was asking for was a place to sleep. not money, or food. i was getting a small unemployment check and eventually i got food stamps. i could have contributed. 

edit: i guess i also have to say that i never asked my parents for anything. i've earned everything i have. i am not a drug user and i have never been. i don't drink and i've been the most responsible of all the children. oh and my post should probably be she let me stay homeless instead of let me be homeless.",3
"for leaving an 18 cent tip and getting the waitress fired?. i was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. i pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress i didn't need change. goes without saying, but i was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. i used to work as a server. i always tip generously. 

the waitress misunderstood my intentions and said ""really?"" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. before i could say anything, she said something like ""woooow- thanks for the generous tip"", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. all the diners around me were staring daggers at me. it was humiliating. 

i flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. he knows me and knows i'd never stiff servers. 

he offered to comp the meal, but i said it wasn't necessary. i just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. the manager insisted that i was owed an apology. made sense to me at the time. she apologizes, gets her tip, i leave, everyone is happy. 

when the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. as soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. all the tears and pleading made no difference. it was ugly. people were filming with their cell phones. 

as she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think i'm the second coming of satan). the manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

when we got home, the wife claimed i was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. i feel like all i did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. she is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. am i being unreasonable? what would you have done in this situation?

"for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (male-female-female) relationship in front of the kids?. i guess it should be are ""we"" the assholes, but idk if that's an accepted acronym here. 

apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but i'll try to lay it out as best i can. 

my family is going on a group vacation this summer. we are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. my husband and i are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

it will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (kids' ages range from 3 to 9). in addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

we initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who i think they've been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

my sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and i don't get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. so as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any pda in front of the kids. we were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
my sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

at this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. i'm conflicted though. she's my sister and i obviously love her. but i also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

"if i decline my twin stepdaughter's request to adopt her?. wife and i got married as widowers. my late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. my daughter was only 1 when she passed away. my current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. the girls are 15 now.

so, yesterday when wife and i were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. and when i asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. i was really happy, because it meant that i had done a good job, but unfortunately i cannot adopt them. i'm actually glad that my wife told me that. a surprise would have caught me off guard. 

the thing is, my wife and i had discussed about this when they were young. i made it clear that i didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but i've never felt comfortable thinking about it. my wife is now asking me to say yes.

"for insulting a customer at my dad's restaurant for making unsolicited suggestions about my hair?. i (f 22) work part time at my father's restaurant/deli as a cashier while i'm in school. i'm mixed, so my natural hair is very thick and curly textured and since i stopped keeping it in a protective style, i like to where it out in a semi afro. one day, a frequent customer (an old man, probably around 70) says, ""you are such a pretty girl, you shouldn't wear your hair like that. you'd look much better if you went to a salon and gotten it straightened out"". 
i said back to him ""maybe you should have some hair before you comment about mine"". he's old, so he's a bit bald. he called me rude and nasty, then flagged down my dad about it. i got in trouble but i refused to apologize. my dad has also commented on my hair before. i told the customer, ""i'm not trying to make it about race but my dad is an older white guy as well, and i'm not white. my hair will never be straight unless i flat iron it"". but i'm not apologizing and i don't feel bad about saying what i said.",3
"for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new £2000 one?. throwaway because i have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

i (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, i splurged on a £2000 ($2600) hp spectre with the highest specs. i treasured the laptop, it was my baby. i used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

now, my step dad is a horrible person. he's always complaining about what i spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so i wouldn't be able to spend so much money. he's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that i paid a lot for.

i should also mention that i don't live with him, so what i spend my money on makes no difference to him.

anyway, i've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. i don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. i could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. when my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear i deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. he's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

my mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. i'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

however, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. i understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and i spent so long saving. i've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less i will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. my whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

so, i know i'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. but am i for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

edit: i just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. let me clear a few things up as well:

\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs

"for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me?. for context, i am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since i was 13 (now 29).

there is a personal trainer, ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. i mention this as it's the reason i think i'm probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.

anyway, i'm not really friends with her, but she's always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. we talk occasionally. yesterday she asked if i wanted to add her on social media and i figured why not, so i said yes.

later in my workout i started looking through her posts out of boredom when i saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. the picture was clearly taken at the gym.

this really angered me because they're trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it's not to their face. i scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. she discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they're working out.

really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. without thinking i just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. ashley was fried immediately.

"for evicting my son for moving in his girlfriend?. i own several properties and rent them out. my son is 20 and goes to school near one of the properties (10-unit luxury apartment). it's cheaper to let him live there rent-free than living in the dorms. obviously the condo is much larger (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. i put several conditions on his living there rent-free. nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn't), no parties, keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave and no moving people in. a couple of months ago, i noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because he moved in his girlfriend. his girlfriend was having issues with her roommates. to add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to la to be an actress and had no where to go. i told my son i didn't give a fuck what problems these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. he lied to me about their moving out. i told him again - no roommates - or leave. he started playing with semantics how they're not really moved in and just spends a night or two. i don't give a fuck. i could be charging 4k a month for the condo (this is westwood, ca) and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights. that could cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees. and if that's not bad enough, his girlfriend talks about the condo as if it's ""their"" condo.

rather than fight with him, again, i asked my property manager to begin the eviction process on my son. i treat him no differently than people who don't pay their rent. i told my son i ain't paying for his boarding at school and his ass is going to pay rent if he moves back home. the commute from my house to ucla is a bitch. he's not 12. i don't owe him anything. he should be kissing my ring for paying for tuition and keeping him on my insurance plan.

and, no, i am not officially renting out the place to either of them. they don't have money, the credit or respect to qualify to rent one of my properties out.",3
"for throwing away my dishes rather than wash them, even if my roommate can't afford to replace them?. i'm 28f, my roommate is 29f and is a single mother to an 8 month old.

we both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. i had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. it's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. i don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. she mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. it begins to smell immediately and after an hour? i've thrown up before from the smell. but whatever, kids gotta eat.

my problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. she'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when i'm at work. after 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. i always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. try as i might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. i even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

after about a month of this, i've begun just throwing them out. instead of cleaning them, i throw my dishes away. we have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate. she's started using my cups to make it and i'll be throwing those away, too. it is nothing to me to replace these things and when i do, i'll be keeping them hidden.

am i the asshole or going overboard?",3
"for not wanting my mom to cover my daughter's chest in pictures. my daughter is 17 months old. being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. when she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.

my mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which i don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples. to me, this just seems really creepy and sexualizing, since my daughter's nipples are no different than my nephew's, who's uncensored photos are also all over my mother's facebook. something about it really rubs me the wrong way, but when i addressed it with my mother, she told me the pictures were inappropriate for her friends to see without the stickers covering her up. so i told her not to post any more pictures of my daughter. aita?",3

i have been doing a lot of reflection on my actions over the past months since my post, including taking into account all of the advice i was getting from my last post.

i have decided to get therapy (which i probably should have done a long time ago i acknowledge) and work on my issues so i can start to be the father to jack that he deserves but never had.

i reached out to him a few days ago to express this to him and he said that while he appreciates that i'm trying, it's going to take him a long time to get over all the bullshit i put him through but that he is willing to try. 

he is honestly such an amazing kid and even though his mom and i don't get along at all, i will say she did good in raising him. 

we have a plan to talk every other day on the phone along with some in person visits and if he feels up to it, i would like to invite him and his boyfriend out for dinner sometime.

i know i have a lot of work to do but i'm trying to be a better man. that includes staying sober. maybe even my two sons could be friends one day. 

i just wanted to update and say thanks.",3
"update for following my 42m wife 27f around for an evening?. here is a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

if you don't want to read it, here's the summary...i believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. so, one happy hour, i followed her. even though i had seen nothing definitive, i confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

believe it or not, i listened to your advice. i received extensive advice from both sides. publicly, everyone agreed i was at fault. in my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. regardless, i sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, brandon. i told her i did not feel as attractive as brandon and worried that as i was getting older, her interest in me was waning. i also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. i apologized for following her and told her i would never do it again.

she told me several things. first, that she was offended i did not trust her. second, that she did suspect brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. the thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

she also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. she reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

so, what of our future? i asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after i had followed her. she joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. she told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (java, specifically). i haven't told her yet, but i plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that i never heard of until researching...

tl;dr - my wife and i are back on track. thank you, genuinely.

thank you to the kind user who helped me figure out how to create this update post.",3
"aita: for shaming people who blast music in public?. i hate when people blare music in public, even if it's music i like. i really don't understand why idiots have to loudly play music in front of everyone. i see these people almost daily on my commute on mass transit and it's been annoying the hell outta me. it's one thing to be listening to loud music in your earbuds, it's another blaring fetty wap from a portable speaker on a bus. 


lately, i've been making a point to carry around a couple crappy earbuds. whenever i hear someone blasting music phones/portable boom box i loudly say ""it must suck to not even afford earbuds, here have a pair on me."" and offer them the crappy earbuds.  my so thinks i'm a cunt for doing this.",3
"for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?. i am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

her name is tara, and she is stunning. she's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. absolutely gorgeous. however, there is one issue. tara has terrible vision. she needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. she gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

in our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, i asked if it was possible for tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. i wasn't saying this to be cruel. i'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but i'm just asking her to take them off during photos. without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

i brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so i could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. i did and it was horrible, but i could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. she left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. i don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. i'm doing her a favour. without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so i would have thought she'd be ok with it.",3
"if i (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?. my side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her n) is getting married in a few months. the ceremony is halfway across the country and i've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. the venue is upscale and beautiful.

the ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the ""cocktail"" definition here(https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

husband doesn't *dress up*. he wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. he wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (that was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

when i broke the news about n's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""no. i'm not wearing a suit. i guess i'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

i told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. i added ""nice priorities there, honey.""

* my mom and brother (n's dad) said yta - just ask n if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* n's mom says i'm nta, but my delivery could have been better (i disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* i don't have very many friends to ask, and i'm not asking n. weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

what do you think?

edit: this got bigger than anticipated. and my very first silver and gold! thank you all! i don't know how i'll get through all your responses, but i'll do my best.

i really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. we live in small town in the midwest. preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

i just need him to not be so inflexible on something so stupid. you'd think i was asking him to kick puppies or cannibalize small children.

"for being upset about a ""prank"" my girlfriend pulled on me?. this past friday, my girlfriend and i had a small get together at our apartment where i proceeded to get very drunk. i'm not a very experienced drinker. my girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. the next morning, i wake up very hungover and thirsty. i see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says ""water"" on it. i thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? very thankful that i didn't have to get up to get water, i proceed to chug the ""water"" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. at that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. 

i felt very bad, i didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so i got up and cleaned everything up even though i felt like dog shit. she denied putting the ""water"" there so i just thought one of our friends did it. it was a shitty thing to do, but i got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. it shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says ""hair of the dog"" then howls.

i confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. i told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. it was a very cruel thing to do. she said i was overreacting and being sensitive.

"for my sister and her bf breaking up?. sister, teri
sisters bf, tom

so i'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week i found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
i thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. i asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would i want fucking crotch goblins living with me. i then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so i asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

i told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

i then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

i automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now i'm regretting it.

"for spending my sons lottery winnings money?. i have a wife (wilhelma, 40) and two sons (sam, 17, and scott, 16).  6 years ago, i ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) i decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  it was a blast.  we all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  i mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  but i specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  well wouldn't you know it, sams ticket won.  of course its actually my ticket, and i had to claim it.  it didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  i sat them both down and explained that i was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  they absolutely wanted a gaming system, and wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  we all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200b;

i bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a disney world trip.  the boys don't even like disney, but it was always wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  another $5k.  last year, sam wanted a car.  wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so i agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  i pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving scott to his stuff as well.  wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200b;

since day 1, i've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  i've always spent my own money on all this stuff.  i have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  wilhelma knows i have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  she knows i was investing the lottery winnings as well.  i've always told her about the money doing well, but i guess i never explicitly said how well.  she also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200b;

sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  while looking at the portfolio, wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  i told her i invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  she then asked why we're only giving sam $30k when it should be $50k.  i said no, the other $40k is mine.  i managed this account, i made the investments, i did all of the work.  plus i paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. the $40k stays and i'll keep investing it.  if the boys need the money, its there, but if not i'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  she thinks i'm stealing ""his"" money since i wouldn't have been able to invest with it if i didn't have it to begin with.  i say its always kinda been my money, and i'm still giving him the $30k i promised him since the beginning.",3
"for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.. hey reddit,

i was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  i am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  we really hit it off right away.  we study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  i said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  he said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""this is my day, i can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" this shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

wedding was going well and i obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but i said no.  she looked hurt and confronted me when i was getting a drink.  she said ""we were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  i really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  i said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

my dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  i got a text from my brother during the party that i was not to talk to her.  i replied dude wtf i get its your day but whats the deal?  we ended up making out after my brother left with his bride to the hotel.  we went back to the hotel holding hands, and laughing and we finally kissed.  well we had sex in my room and i got her number and we are going to have a real first date this week.

i got a text from my brother later that day that his new wife told him what happened and he was extremely angry and couldn't believe i was so selfish.   my dad threw a fit when he found out and said he won't pay for my wedding when it happened.  i told him idc because i have a good job now.  i feel bad tho, did i ruin the day for my brother aita?",3

"update: if i told my daughter to find a different hobby. belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

i won't lie when i say that i immediately ignored the majority of you telling me i was the asshole. or maybe ignore is the wrong word. i think i expected that from the get go, so being told i ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe sahms"" rolled off my back. but, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) i was setting for her. there was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, i'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. i've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. i won't get into details because i'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that i'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. i gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (surprise) i was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when i had to work at things i hated for the things we needed. it seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. that's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that i was so resentful. 

i like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (i never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to michaels) but i can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. i helped her build a miniature restaurant last saturday and i've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as i type this. i can't regain the time i've lost, but i can make sure she doesn't have to live the life i'm currently living.

"for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?. my birthday was this past monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. i'm originally from michigan but go to school in texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. they were like my favorite thing when i was little and i'm not sure if they're only available in michigan but i definitely can't get them in texas. 

my boyfriend and i each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. when i got back from work the next day i was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

i went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. he laughed and said something along the lines of ""i couldn't help it!"" i called him a selfish asshole and told him i couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

he seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. he started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but i was so upset with him i just left. i came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. he said he couldn't believe i was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

i realize it seems stupid and i might have overreacted, but i still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. i've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought i was being ridiculous and that i shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

am i the asshole?

update: i've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so i figured i'd post one here. i haven't been able to read every comment, but i've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. a lot of you seem to think i'm just really stingy with my cake, but what i articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that i moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

when he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. he apologized for eating all of the cake, and i apologized for losing my temper about it. when we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. i'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

"for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend"". i've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (m18) (f17). since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). a girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, i'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. my girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

a few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. shes also been telling her things like ""why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

i eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment asap and was moved to a different room yesterday. a few hours ago i went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that i was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

things eventually escalated and i left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

am i in the wrong? i don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

"for telling my wife we are making our daughter, not her?. okay, so my wife and i are expecting our first child. she is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife's medical issues caused the obgyn to be extra cautious). 

during the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter's different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. it was the first time we didn't really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. my wife started crying, and i was comforting her, when she said the words. ""i can't believe i'm making a human being.""

i kept comforting her, but i waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. i also told her that saying she's ""making"" the baby on her own is not accurate, since i provided half the genetic material. 

my wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking i don't appreciate what she's putting her body through to be pregnant. obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that i've attended at least two doctors appointments every month. i show her with actions, not words, that i appreciate her. 

i just don't think it's fair to claim i haven't contributed something to making our daughter. she is still upset the next day. so, aita?

the condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing i guess because of theft or something idk but i asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn't doing anything if she could open it up. she made a comment ""aren't you a little young to be needing those young man"" which really caught me off guard and i sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and i just mumbled again that i needed them. 

she basically made a condescending exaggerated ""hmfph"" noise and said ""i outta really call your mama and tell her what you're doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don't need to be using these"" before moving towards the condoms. my mom and i go shopping here often so while i personally didn't know this lady, it's not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

here's where idk if i'm ta because she was getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that i basically aggressive said ""it's none of your business for why i need these, fuck off and do your job"". she was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like ""excuse me?"" and i said ""you heard what i said"". 

she said i'm not going to be doing anything and i needed to watch my mouth and she's not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that's when i got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so i said ""give me a manager if you don't want to do your fucking job then"" and she stammered before refusing, so i ended up asking another employee. 

long story short i ended up getting the condoms, but i'm still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart's been racing the entire day. did i handle the situation badly? aita?",3
"because i refuse to spend money on my ex's kids despite being well off?. i have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. i was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

obviously that didn't work out because she got pregnant (i did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, i'm a dad now anyway)i asked her to abort, she told me she'd changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

i wasn't thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established i set about paying child support and that was it. i had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and i was still a kid myself.

after a few months though i felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so i put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and i'm so glad and grateful that i got to be his dad.  i was 18 when i had him, and over the years i was lucky enough that i was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so i'm able to give my son experiences that i never had. 

he chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he'd always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he'd get yelled at because he's the oldest, etc. 

his mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. she is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

it was his birthday last week and as a gift i bought him a car, which he'll be needing soon anyway and which i've had the cash aside for for *years*. when his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me i that i'm a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because i've 'never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it's obvious his dad is spending money on him' ... i snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids i have no obligation to just so she doesn't feel bad? 

she said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that i was selfish for having a fund for only my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. i told her that's an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

she's normally pretty level headed so i honestly have no idea why she thinks it's acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- i've never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, i just want him to have the best i can give him.",3
"for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?. throwaway cause reasons.

backstory: my wife and i have two kids (9f, 4m). my wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. she had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. no major complications or anything like that. 

on the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my sil, and utilize ivf in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. so when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then i would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. for example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. my wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my sil. she would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my sil and she would basically replace it with her own idea. so that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. the baby is due at the end of this month.

so last night my wife received a facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my sil that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. my wife lost it. she started saying how completely insane my sil and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

while i said that i agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, i can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. they can't afford to go through ivf again and my sil is too old it would be high risk anyway. my entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. we would just need to get our records. i also said i can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so i can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. but overall, i sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

well she took this as me siding with them over her. she's been angry with me ever since. aita?

(also, please don't reply with ""you should always side with your wife! hurrr dee durrr"". i don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... don't bother.)

edit title: nephew :/

edit 2: while my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough i think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). we are pretty close. we all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. they watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. there's always been full trust between us. and i think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. i don't know if that changes anything? for those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

edit 3: holy cow, this blew up since last i checked. first of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. to address some common questions/comments... 1) no, sil has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. and there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) no, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. i feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? it was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) it is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. she's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my sil had. it was more the fact that my sil rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) i probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... but i didn't really ""take a side"", at least i wouldn't consider it that. it's not like i said, ""well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". it was more the fact that i wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think i was taking their side (i think?). so take that for what it's worth. 5) i appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... i feel like that's what i tried to do here. maybe i didn't handle it to perfection and i agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). maybe i'll send an update if anyone is interested.

edit 4: just cause it's hilarious that i actually have to address this... but no, i was not implying that just because the baby is ivf or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. not quite sure how some folks deduced that. i was merely saying that due to those circumstances i could more easily empathize with my sil's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",3
"for ghosting at parties?. the other day i was at a bbq and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""i have a bone to pick with you"". i was a little shocked because i like to think i'm nice enough and get along with people, but i was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""you don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. i prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. i do it because if i announce i am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why i'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah i might go too"" ending the party earlier. i prefer to just disappear. 


anyway i explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". we're australian so i told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. after that bbq i made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but i still prefer to ghost. my wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - i like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, i do thank the host and i now know it's an irish goodbye). am i the asshole?


edit: i should note that i do try to tell the host i am leaving (if i can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not i text them to say thanks. it's just everyone else i'm trying to avoid.


edit 2: she was not the host of this bbq, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. i ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and i was 15 shades of fucked up.


edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked


edit 4: that this is called an irish goodbye. thanks for all of the support from fellow irish goodbyers. too all the people that think i'm rude, i accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward",3
"for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?. my 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) she is not in a relationship with the father. he reeaallyyy, i can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. i honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

she has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. after she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby i asked her how she is going to manage that? this was the jist of the convo:

her: i'll get a job. 
me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
her: i thought you and dad could.
me: absolutely not, i'm not raising another baby.

pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, i'm practically going to be its mother. i'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how i want to spend my retirement years. it's not fair to us. so i told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, i love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but i feel like we need to be united on this. i just want to know if  i'm in the wrong here.

aita?

edit: to everyone acting like i'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- i will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. i just will not raise this baby.",3
"for walking out of an intervention my family surprised me with?. basically, i think everyone's overreacting.

i'm 23 and i got incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning. i do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. 

i spent the rest of weekend in the hospital recovering. it was a one time stupid mistake. 

yesterday, i went over to my parent's house for dinner. 

when i walked in, they were all sitting in the living room with somebody i'd never seen before.

i asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. i did and the man i didn't know started talking. 

to summarize, he said that my family was worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.

i got upset and said that everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. i said that i realized that i had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. i stood up and walked out at that point. 

my mom ran out after me with the interventionist and said that they only did this because they loved me. 

i said that everyone was acting crazy and i hopped in my car and went home. 

my brother has been texting me begging me to reconsider but i haven't answered. 

everyone is crazy overreacting. getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. it just happened once and i regret it. i have a good job and i look after myself. i don't think i need rehab or that intervention. 

that said, maybe i did handle the intervention the wrong way. i maybe could've responded in a way that made them feel better instead of blowing up. 

for walking out?",3
"for rejecting my dad's apology and not agreeing to donate my kidney to him?. 
my parents split up when i was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. my mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and i and stopped paying child support. he justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way i had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. about a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. however, today he asked if my sister and i could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which i had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. i rejected his request and told him i wasn't ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and i suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. after rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said i was murdering him. some of my friends also said i should forgive him because he is my father and that i am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. so aita?

edit: his other kids are still pretty young (~15 and i'm not sure how many other kids he has but i think at least one other) so i'm not sure they are able to donate at their age. also an update: my aunt (my dad's sister) who i also haven't spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. at this point i'm leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.

edit2: thank you for all your replies and advice. i've decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister. i realize now that i shouldn't feel any guilt for not donating as this man is not truly my dad.",3
"for ordering a meat dish while eating with my vegan friend.. yesterday my friend 
/acquaintance and i went to a restaurant after work. she is a vegan and ordered a vegan dish. i ordered something that contained beef. 

when my dish came, my friend was shocked to see that it contained meat because she assumed that it didn't (for some reason). she said she no longer felt comfortable eating at the same table as me unless i sent the food back. i said no way i was going to do that.

she said ""maybe we can reschedule"" and that she was sorry but she could not eat with someone who was eating meat.

i said ok maybe we can get our food packed up. we did and then she said she wasnt feeling good and had to go back to her hotel. so i just sat on a bench in the park and ate my food by myself. it was really weird. 

should i have been more accommodating? she isn't allergic to anything, apparently the smell of meat makes her sick? which i just found out today. aita.",3
"aita? told gf to move out and life has gotten 10x harder for her.. hi

i'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

in a nutshell my gf (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/m) house last year.  the house is owned and i bought it because i have two children (8 yo twins - m and f) from a previous relationship.

when she moved her and her girl in i made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- left mountains of food everywhere.  - left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- got muck/handprints everywhere
- broke and refused to replace things in my house
- would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- left mountains of clothes everywhere
- used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- constant drama, shouting, arguing - witnessed by neighbours
- literally drained me emotionally and financially
- both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- kept leaving the toilet a mess
- treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

when i questioned her on any of these matters she would say i was being controlling.

about a month ago, a serious argument erupted and i told her it's best she leave.  i said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  it was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

we are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place i feel terrible.  she's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously i was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

i feel dreadful for this, i feel like maybe i should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

aita?  or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


edit: just to follow up - she doesn't drive and i also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before i was acting like her own private taxi service.  ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

update:  wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

after getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say i'm nta and the rest saying i am for staying with her i've decided to break this off.
like some of you've mentioned, i owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  a good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  as of this point, she is no longer in my life.

a while ago i asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""yes i think of you getting shouted at by xxxx""

some of you have said i'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  i would argue against this, but if i stay with her i would have to agree with you all.

update:  i wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, i'll respond.

a)  no the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if i was lucky.

b)  she never gave bjs

c)  she insisted on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  every time.  she told me ""go down on me, or there is no sex""

d)  never did anything else.  vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",3
"for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid?. my husband and i have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). they currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. my husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

so here's my current dilemma: i want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. it'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but i've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. however, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. his oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. i was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. i'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" and now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. i still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. i feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. however i get that he wants the best for his kid as well but i resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

i want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and i want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. for thinking this is a good plan?",3
"if i broke up with my girlfriend over my cat's mental health?. throwaway because she knows my reddit account. hear me out on this one. please? 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. i've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting molly. molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. about six months later in december she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. she fell in love immediately and so did i. i tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. she said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200b;

i still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. for one, molly refuses to listen to him. he growls, he hisses at her. she started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. she doesn't listen to me when i try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. she keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. i work at home, and he's a completely different cat when i'm home and she isn't.  he plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200b;

i've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. every single time i bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. they're not, but she's not a good fit for him. so at this point i'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  our relationship isn't that solid but i think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too.

"if i don't disclose that i'm a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners. i (22f) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. i received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. i connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. i still really don't know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. however, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. i talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. i did some research, and was able to corroborate with dna testing that he is indeed my mother's first cousin. obviously that was shocking, and i feel like my existence was a mistake. i've been struggling with it. thankfully, from what i've read, there's very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and i don't have any medical issues. i do wear contacts, have adhd, generalized anxiety disorder and auditory processing disorder, and i'm prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). but none of these are major in the slightest and i live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. i'm in a relationship right now, i don't know how long it'll last or if it'll last. i would love to eventually marry him but i'm 22 and i'm  being a realist here. if i didn't tell him since there's virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also i'm scared that he would break up with me because of it. 

also before anyone makes any kentucky/rolltide, my bio family is from ashland, ky. my life is a meme at this point

edit: i honestly did not think this would blow up so much. really glad this is a throwaway. i guess some info for people.

1. my mother didn't know she and my father were related. growing up she never knew her mother's side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. my parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn't a sexually abusive situation. they went to the same high school and they didn't look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (i think their mothers were siblings). mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, i think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. boyfriend and i have been together about a year, which isn't long but i can see it leading to marriage. also he's not american, so no chance of us being related! trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. views of incest are a bit different here in america for you non americans. especially since i live in a very religious area, my family are strict catholics. it's not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

"for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend's friend is staying at our apartment?. about a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and i said yes. so the next day his friend shows up while i'm at work. when i get home i greet the friend (who i've never met before). i then proceed to go to the bedroom where i change out of my work clothes and throw on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. i never wear a bra at home as i find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. i then go out to the living room to join them. as i'm sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of ""dude, put on a bra"". i figure he's joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so i just brush it off. he doesn't bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. so his friend comes over and this time i'm home when he gets dropped off.  i was not wearing a bra when he arrived. i would like to point out that i was wearing a rather baggy t-shirt so it wasn't as if you could really see anything. that being said i do have enormous titties (i wear a size 40i bra). immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone ""i thought i asked you last time to please wear a bra!!""  i'm taken aback and i don't really know what to say. i kind of stammer our a ""what,why?"" 

him: i feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
me: but you can't actually see my boobs 
him: are you kidding me? they're huge! of course i can see them! 
me: dude, i'm wearing a baggy shirt. at most you can see a bit of an outline. i don't understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
him: you're joking right??
me: no...? 
him: fucking unbelievable

i look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. so i excuse myself to the bedroom. a little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if i'm ok. i tell him i'm fine, just a bit taken aback. he asks if i wanna come play video games with them in the living room and i agree. before we're out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe i should put on a bra.  i had explained to him before how i felt about bras. he said he understood but didn't want to make his friend uncomfortable. i was annoyed and told him i would just stay in the bedroom. so for the rest of his friend's stay i stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

so finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. he tells me i should've just sucked it up and put on a bra and that i was kind of being an asshole about it. i feel like i should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also i wonder if i should've been more accommodating to a guest that's very important to my bf. 
so, am i the asshole here?",3
"for objecting to 'girls day'?. i'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because i was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when i was young. my two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


about 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. originally this was to see one of the magic mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. originally it didn't bother me, because i'm an adult and i have my own life, and my own house, and i really didn't even think about it. but an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. my aunt's birthday was in january and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. so i bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


when i asked what was going on for her birthday, i was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. this kind of irked me because when i mentioned i bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. i felt pretty left out since i am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


i griped about and was told that i was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. i agree with that, but once again, i'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was i was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when i asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

at this point i was very annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so i decided i needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. so i removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my facebook. now my phone is being blown up and i'm being told that i'm immature and i need to grow up. i responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and i'm just going to follow that example. 


am i the asshole here? ",3
"for embarrassing a friend on his date because he didn't pay back the money he owed me?. so i lent a friend of mine £500. he needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. 
not a problem, i trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. 

payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. i sent him a message about it. he said ""oh yeah, sorry i forgot, i'll do that now"" 

two weeks pass and still nothing. i message him again. he said he'd send me the money. still nothing. he was then avoiding me so i wasn't able to see him face to face. 

i messaged him again and he didn't reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. i've not been able to get hold of him, nor have i seen him. 

this weekend just gone, i was out at a restaurant and i happened to see him as i was being seated at my table. he was on what looked like a date. 

now at this point i could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. it's worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. so i decided i'd go and say hello. 

i pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how i am etc. 

i then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. he looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so i tried something from one of the other plates. at this point his date (i'd learnt that this was their second date) said to me, ""excuse me, but this is our food. what do you think you're doing?"" 

i looked at her and said ""well since i'm pretty much funding this meal, i figured i may as well sample what my money is getting."" 

i then said to my friend, ""it was nice to see you, i'll leave you to it. we can catch up another day.""

i then left to go back to my table. the people i were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. some were in favour of what i'd done, others not so much. 

so i'm asking you lot, aita?

"for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?. throwaway- im just going to get in to it.

i (19m) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, i was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

i ran in to the the office which was really crowded. there was only one secretary, and i knew instantly who it was- my mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

i ran in but there was a line up, i told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if i was blind ""there's a line hun"".

i waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

i got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""ready to talk to me"" i was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. i was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation i was in.

i dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. the secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

she started by telling me ""see hun, i told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, a student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, i could have handled this situation a lot better- i have a lot of students to deal with""

i looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

i yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""the school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

are you serious? how am i supposed to react in that situation? yes, i agree i was really angry, but i feel like i was justified- my sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- i would have waited if i heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. aita?

edit- 

to add context, some people are confused as to why i didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) i don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, i guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",3

"if i don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *i do have enough money.. my sister is having a destination wedding in the dominican republic (all-inclusive).  it'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
my sister would be very upset if i don't attend.  my parents say i should go, and that i'm being selfish for saying i'm not going.  

my sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   i don't make a ton of money, but i have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  while i really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. and less importantly, i have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as i don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  in my defence, i've worked hard for my money and i sacrificed quite a lot to be where i am financially.  and while i have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because i earn a big salary. but, because i work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  the cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  it would also require me using a full week of what little time i get off work.

 i really don't know if i'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if i'm being reasonable.   last night i almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, i couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  so what do you guys think?  not wanting to attend?",3

"for introducing my gf as a model?. so i have been dating this girl for awhile now. she's beautiful. she works as a professional model. not like an instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

she also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. she usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. for some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. she only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

so the other day i was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. i said ""thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. later she said i was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and i had no right to correct her. that what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. that her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

i dont see what the big deal is so here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*edit just to clarify i she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. i just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after i did it. also i was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when i introduced her to my friends.

\*\*edit 2 theres so many comments and i am trying to read them all. i do respect her. i do love her for more then her beauty. shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. she's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. honestly i am blown away with how pretty she is and i've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. so that part does excite me.

i genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think i am the asshole for this i do value how much money a field brings in. when i chose my area in college i did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. i am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and i am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. i'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

i shot an apology text (we're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her dojo. she said we can talk after work and i offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200b;

\*\*final edit

at this point i imagine no one is reading anymore i asked the mods if i should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

i was really bothered by the things people said. not because i wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. i didn't want to be the guy everyone said i was. i really didn't.

&#x200b;

first i want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. yes i knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. we have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200b;

next i want to say she was meeting some of my good friends. i was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. i was trying to point out her accomplishments. i thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. i can see where i was wrong. i did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and i felt it was more glamorous. i am an asshole for that. i did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and i'm also the asshole for that too. i wont deny it. but i dont just see her as a trophy. i do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because i learned something really really important.

&#x200b;

after this thread blew up like it did and i had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick i was i knew i was dead wrong and had fucked up. i texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. i asked her if we could talk about it and i could try and make it up to her. she agreed. i told her i wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if i could sit in on some of her classes. she said she would like that. i made it top priority. i left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200b;

what i saw really opened my eyes to be honest. i watched two classes and took part in the second one. the first one was her with a kids after school class. she was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. thats dead wrong. it must be much harder to teach kids and i think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. i saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she does want to be a mom one day).

&#x200b;

the second class was a womens self defense class. i took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and i was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. i got manhandled by about 15 women. we had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. for those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200b;

i definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. she taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. most importantly i saw the qualities beyond her appearance that i love most about her really shine. i realized the things i love most about her; her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. this is really the part of her i love. it doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. i also saw how much she loved what she was doing. i saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. i'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong i was.

&#x200b;

i told her this when i went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. she also filled me on the modeling thing. she doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200b;

first off its not as glamours as i thought it was

&#x200b;

she said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200b;

she works as a model because of a few accidents. she was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. thats all it took for her to be a model. it took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. she started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. she feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. she said being called a ""model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by what she is and not who she is. she doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. she doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200b;

she doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. that she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. she doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. she feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. she wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200b;

this is where i lit up and felt i had something to really offer her. i work in finance. go ahead hate me but i do like money. i like to have it, i like to make it, i like the freedom it affords and i like to watch it flow and grow. so i offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. i thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what i know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. we both win. she agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and i will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200b;

finally i asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. i learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. in the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why i love her. so honestly thank you yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but i needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. is she the better person? yes she is. do i deserve her. no i dont, but i am going to do better. i really do love this woman, i wont ever do this again.",3
"if i buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?. i guess it goes without saying that i am proposing, but i should mention my girlfriend doesn't know i will be. i picked out a ring i think she'll like. she never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. so i found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. she loves green and gold jewellery, and i spent a long time finding this one. it's a created emerald which i think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

the ring is cheap. it was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. i mentioned this to my sister who said i was a dick, essentially. apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. she says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. i'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

i could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. i certainly wouldn't know why i'm paying more, i don't think she would either. however, i am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new tv for £250. i kind of realised i'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and i started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. so wibta?

edit: i just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. it's the proposal in terms of when and how i do it that would be a surprise.

edit 2: i really want to thank everyone for contributing and helping me out. i left to run some errands and returned to an overwhelming response full of additional advice which goes above and beyond, i really appreciate it. i am not going to be able to reply to everyone, but i am reading and upvoting.

edit 3: thank you for the gold. i haven't found the comment it's on yet. i'm still trying to work through the comments!",3
"for having fun in front of miserable people?. my husband and i rent a house with his brother and wife. we live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. we get along fine usually.


my husband and i have a son. he's just turned five. the early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! during this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. there were quite some bad days, but my husband and i got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. so a few days ago, i pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. when we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. it seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. i sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.then my son and i leave for the movie.


today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that i didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. i'm kind of shocked that i'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. i feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

aita?

eta: for all those asking if i resent my in laws for not helping... i think any parent would like help. but i don't feel entitled to their help when it's my husband's and my decision to have said child. however i am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",3
"for not paying to save ""my"" dog's life after my mom ruined its health?. when i (22f) was 11, the family dog died. i was very sad and repeatedly asked my parents to get a new one. they finally agreed, on the condition that i'd be responsible for it and take care of it. that's how i got mickey, the cutest cocker spaniel and best boy ever.

i did take care of him. i took him for a walk every day. started spending my own money to buy him food. i was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, i even read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. they made a big point of feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so i tried to stick to dog food.

but my mom (53f) would still give him ""treats"" which consisted of pretty much anything she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. throughout the years i confronted her about it but she'd just brush it off every time. i tried to buy her ""good"" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued to feed it junk.

over the years, mickey started gaining weight. he refused to eat proper dog food, eating only my mom's junk food. he also grew very attached to her, mostly because she spent all day at home with him and fed him. i was still the one taking him on walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to prefer her company to mine. she'd even make snide remarks about how he'd ""chosen her as his mommy"" and ""liked her better"". this only increased my resentment towards my mom.

fast forward a few years, i had to move away for college. i reluctantly agreed to leave mickey with my parents. his health started to decline even more. my mom didn't take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. every time i visited i'd see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it'd break my heart.

this has been going on for four years. mickey is now eleven years old, half blind and with very limited mobility. last week, he started vomiting blood. my parents took him to the vet and found it's going to need surgery to survive.

that surgery's going to cost roughly $2000. my mom doesn't have the necessary funds and asked me to cover it. i told her i can't do it. i do have the money, but it's nearly all of my savings which i need for myself. i love mickey, but i can't justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he'll probably die from something else soon anyway.

upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and ""basically killing the dog"". she said i'm the reason she bought mickey in the first place, and reminded me of my promise to care for him. i told her she's the reason he's dying, and that she's been poisoning him for years.

later my dad called, told me i'm being unfair, that even if my mom hasn't cared properly for the dog, it's wrong to let him die ""just to punish her"". the dog's life is more valuable than an ""i told you so"" to my mom. he asked me to reconsider. i still said no, but now i feel really conflicted. so reddit, aita?",3
"for not trading seats on a plane?. this happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought i was a bit rude, but i thought i was completely justified.


so we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. i figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so i booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


when we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. then he asked if i could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. i was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. i honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. so we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" i answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


as i said my girlfriend said i was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

"for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen?. my (25m) girlfriend (23f) has always talked about how it's her dream to move to x country. she brought it up on our first date (we've been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

at the beginning, i went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if i would go with her, how crappy our current country is (i'm an expat and she's a local), etc etc 

recently, however, every few times she mentions it, i'll bring up her spending habits. in the time we've been together, she's spent around 8,000usd+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

the last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she'd need to save to get started. 

after we had the number, i started calculating something else. balenciaga shoes + lv bag + gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it's never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

she's called me ta, that i'm trying to control her money, i'm trying to humiliate her, make her feel ""small"" and it's none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

"- my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch. on thursday evenings my daughter (9f) goes to dance class with her friend anna (9f). my wife told me to pick my daughter and anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

i pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. my daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and i ask anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. we all order and start eating, when suddenly anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. i ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and i look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

i rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. i felt horrible. i call my wife when anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and i do not have anna's mother's phone number. so after anna is given the all clear i immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

her mother is furious, saying that i could have killed her child. i said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would i assume something like that. she responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. she also said that she didn't know i would be getting them dinner (school ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so i thought it would be safe to assume i would be giving them food..) i apologized for what happened, but still feel like anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

basically i 20m recently started a job where i have mostly female coworkers. amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. they go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. there is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. she refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so i assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. however, friday i asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which i get bc i love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. when she later complained again about not being invited to something i kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, i don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. obviously i feel *awful* now, i didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. still i'm saved a little by the fact that i didn't know, right?

eta: i bought her her favourite coffee and apologised this morning. she's still being a bit standoffish, but it's better.",3
"if i report my doorman for calling me pretentious?. i moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. it's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. i always say a pleasant, ""hi, how are you? have a nice day/evening"" to them when i leave or enter the building, but i don't stop to chat to them as i have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200b;

one of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as i'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. i usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as i'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200b;

the other day he shouted out to me, ""come here, miss pretentious,"" so this time i turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""what did you call me?"" he then proceeds to say i'm pretentious and obviously think i'm better than everyone else in the building because i won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. his tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. i politely explained that it's not that i think i'm better than everyone but that i'm just really tired after work and want to go home. i also said i find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as i'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if i wanted to). he ended by saying that i won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if i keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. i told him (again, politely) that i wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and i then walked away.

&#x200b;

since then i have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""hello, miss pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as i walk into the building. i have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200b;

i feel like i should probably talk to him and tell him i don't appreciate being called that, but honestly i just want to report him to his supervisor as i'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and i feel like i shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building). so if i just go ahead and report him? i don't want to get him fired or anything, but i do want him to stop.",3
"for mentioning that i had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor?. i'm posting this from my wife's account and both perspectives are included. i, the husband, am asking if i'm the asshole. 

this is a topic we've been debating for the past almost two years now. it'd be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

my perspective (husband):

my wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. over the prior couple months i had started developing an intermittent toothache. about two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, i probably ate something delicious. 

after eating something delicious, i can't quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. i'm talking sharp, eye-watering pain. her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  i didn't want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

once they arrived, to my surprise i was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. that with a couple excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife's contractions started to pick up. 

am i the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

wife's perspective:

my husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. it kept getting worse, and every time he'd complain i'd say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

so as he mentioned, as i was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. granted i wasn't in terrible pain, but for a few hours while i was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

i did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but i had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment i felt i should be focusing on. 

i'd like to also mention it wasn't just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

he is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",3
"for making my sil cry at her baby shower by suggesting we should stop exchanging gifts in the future?. i come from a fairly well off family, and my husband and i do well  (although we both work high demand jobs for it). we've always been very generous to his side of the family. gifts are very much both my husband and my ""love language"" and in my culture (chinese), elaborate gifts to inlaws are very socially acceptable as a way to show they are held in high esteem. it also helps with some of our guilt for being super busy and not always around. additionally, my side of the family exchanges generous gifts. one concern of mine originally was to treat my husband's family the same as my family, i.e. by not spending way more on my family than his.

last christmas, we had some weirdness over christmas day present opening. i had purchased a lovely cashmere throw for sil (husband's brother's wife). she googled the brand and price then and there (which kind of annoyed me) and later i overheard her make some joke about how she could pay ""half a mortgage payment.""  several hours later during brunch, someone asked her what was wrong (she seemed upset) and she confessed that our presents always make her feel bad, she's tired of us ""throwing our money"" in her and her husband's face, and christmas has become really stressful with pressure over gift giving. husband and i apologized profusely, and did some self reflection afterwards on the unintentional effects of elaborate gift giving and decided to go more low key in the future. although a little part of it has always sat poorly with me since. 

this past saturday, i attended a baby shower for the same sil. it's the first gift giving occasion since christmas and i really wanted to do it carefully. i asked a coworker who recently had a baby what range is typically appropriate (she said she mostly got gifts between $30-$50) and so i decided on three little things from the registry totaling just over $30. anyways, at the shower it becomes clear that while certainly most gifts were in the $30-50 range, all attendees who were family members seemed to give more like $100 gifts. near the end of the event, mil pulled me aside and said that sil felt like i was being spiteful to her for  christmas. i again apologized and as a cover, said that husband and i had written a check for the little one's college fund as well but didn't feel it was appropriate to hand to her during the present opening. then i scurried off to the bathroom and wrote a check for $100. when i found sil by herself for a second i handed her the check and explained that we wanted to give her this earlier but present opening seemed like a bad time. she looked at the check and kind of bitchily said, ""we don't need your money.""

i kind of snapped and told her bluntly (and not like yelling, but not like in hushed tones either - people nearby apparently definitely overheard) that her that i was tired of her shit and if it made her feel better, we could just stop exchanging presents in the future. she started crying and i immediately left. i've been getting my texts from everyone in the family and her best friend about how i ruined the baby shower ever since.

(eta for additional  context - my husband and his family are american and we live in the us. we are in our early/mid 30s, my bil is 28 and sil is 24 or 25.)

(eta2 - i realized her comment might have made the xmas gift sound way more than it was. the throw was 320 pounds, which isn't quite half a mortgage payment, but not cheap either. i purchased it for her during an business trip to scotland last year. it is not fancy looking or flashy at all (light grey)  and not a obvious "" designer"" brand, just an old scottish maker. it was intended to be good quality and last many years. if she hadn't looked it up i don't think it would have been an obviously expensive gift.)",3
"for not letting my boyfriend's best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?. throwaway because all parties know my account name.

backstory: my boyfriend (alex\*) and i have been together for 4 years, i've become friends with his two best friends (james\* and noah\*) but we're not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. i work for an airline and one of the major perks is that i get discounts on flights that i can also use for family and friends. as i am in my first year with the company i only get a certain number of discount seats and i had 3 left for the year.

situation: alex asked me if i could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. i happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. he booked his time off work and they made their plans. they were to send me the money and then i would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

three nights ago alex came home really upset. he told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. he was upset because he couldn't move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. i was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. to make up for i started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

james messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. no ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. i was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. i sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as i would be using the seats for me and alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. he replied with a barrage of texts saying that i was being selfish and unfair as i had ""promised"" two seats to him and noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. he even phoned alex to complain. alex is torn. he thinks it's a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn't want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so i should just give them the seats to keep the peace. i refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

am i the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200b;

update: thank you everyone for your support. i must admit i know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the nta votes but i hate going back on my word and i guess i did feel a bit like an asshole just because i've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so i needed some honest opinions. this sub has shown me the light and i will be showing alex this when i get home. he is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if i have to grow it in a lab. i'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. any holiday suggestions?

2nd update: thank you everyone for your votes and insights. it made me realise that even though most of you have voted me nta, there are some things i hadn't considered. i have spoken to alex and shown him this thread (guess i don't know why i used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. he apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn't stand up for himself and i apologised for not discussing my choice with him before i told his friends they can't use my discount in the way that i did. he said he's just going to let it play out but he'll be willing to forgive them eventually. so for those wanting a final dramatic update, i don't think we'll be getting one. 
for anyone asking or not believing the story because of this: i don't know the story of the concert, this is the story as i know it from my point of view. they're going to see skepta.",3
"for sticking up for an ex instead of my girlfriend?. throwaway. my girlfriend and i are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. i need to know if ita. 

i'm in a very ldr with basically the girl of my dreams. absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

she came to town, and i was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. they threw a party, and while on the way, gf randomly asked ""are there any girls i should be worried about"" this is probably where i fucked up,  but i explained that a girl i used to see will likely be there. explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn't seen each other since well before i met gf. i was asked if we ever slept together. i said yes, because...we had. also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn't a big deal. 

everything started out great. everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

gf gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. she randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. i was honestly so surprised. so was everyone else. 

i apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said ""no worries. play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes"" (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. she was so devastated that i didn't tell her that was out of line; however, i feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

we got into the biggest argument about how i didn't have the decency to stand up for her. i told her honestly, i should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can't be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

she's now back on a plane, and we will ""discuss further"" once she clears her head.

am i the asshole?

edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

edit 2: update: i've gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. i admitted that i'm an asshole for how i've gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. i adore her, but i'm not comfortable with the default response being ""i'm jealous, i'm going to be rude to someone i don't know"" 

she is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always ""choose"" the other girl. i tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that i can't do anything about that, but i do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. every one of them, and i definitely think she can recover. but she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it's probably not going to developed past this. 

for the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren't strictly platonic. yes, i understand her comment was towards me. plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess i should take a page out of his book.

"for messing with my sister's fake profile?. going to try to make this quick. i'm 22 and my sister is 18. i went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and i notice she has facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. i have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. i know i shouldn't have but i snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake facebook profile of me.

i'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. i don't do social media. i'm a private person and i don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. other pictures that she had were ones i had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

i delete all of the pictures and i check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food i had taken pictures of. i go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that i had taken for my boyfriend.

i deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. i uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""the real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. i've heard her sobbing from her room all day but i'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

&#x200b;

update: i decided to confront my sister since i couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. as soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. i told her that i don't think i could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. i asked her why she had the fake profile. apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. he really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. she got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. i brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. i told her that i didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. i asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that i can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. she tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. at that point i just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. i told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. she got upset again and i left shortly after. 

&#x200b;

i saw people mentioning that i should change my password on my computer- i've done that. i've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which i'm probably going to take him up on. i can't be in the house anymore- i feel so uncomfortable and i feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to.

"for telling my so he'll need to limit gym time after baby?. i'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. this pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, i wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. during the newborn phase, i was so exhausted. i was breastfeeding, baby had colic, i was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. i do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and i was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

my husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. he would silently be ticked if i asked him to not go to the gym. i truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). but sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. sometimes, i needed another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. example: one saturday i got up to pump. they were both awake (8:00am). he said he was going to head to the gym since i was awake, and i started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and i got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" i told him that it must be nice to even have the energy to go to the gym. the only thing i wanted to be able to do was sleep. i got the response ""i'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

now that i'm pregnant again, i mentioned to him ""if i thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am i supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" i told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. well, he did not receive this kindly. he texted me the next day ""just to be clear, i feel like i do a lot. i will not be able to help out with daycare, as i drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. i will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and i need to go to relieve stress. the reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while i think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. you need to think about if you want this baby.

"for telling my ex i refuse to share custody of our daughter?. my ex an i have an incredibly long history. we met when i was 18 and he was 19. he was my first love and we dated about a year. but after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until i turned 23. which was also the same time i found out i was pregnant...

he was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when i found out. he also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. i got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

when i found out i was pregnant i told him immediately. he was very very angry and asked what i was going to do about it. i told him i'd be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child's life because it was going to ruin everything for him. i told him that wasn't an option. 

i myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it's a big stem of my mental illnesses now. all things he knew.

after begging him to be in the baby's life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. they offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if i never forced him to be a real father. his parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

at first i said no. i refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best i take the offer. they told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. i finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

i took sole custody of course. it's been 7 years and i had a beautiful baby girl that i love more than anything on earth. every single month i get a check and not once has it ever been late. i haven't seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. until about a week ago. 

i get a call and it's my ex. he tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. the daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! i was infuriated and told him no. he told me that i can't just say no because he's gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

i was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. he told me he was sorry but he's ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. when i told him i was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me i was being ridiculous and i need to grow up. 

i've told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me i need to give him a chance and that i'm just being a bitch. the only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when i was a child. i know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but i just feel like i need to fight this. for being so against him getting any custody?

"for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?. my daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


she would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""wa!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


we tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. she thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


so a while earlier she was on the sofa playing nintendo switch, looking very focused, and i decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


i approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""wa!"". she was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


my wife called me a childish ah for scaring her like that, but i meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. aita?


edit: i did talked to her and explain why i did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted i apologise and make it up for her. i don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so i ended up posting on reddit to see if i am really in the wrong.

"if i tell my bio daughter that i don't want to help her or have her in my life because she decided that her stepmom should adopt her once she turned 18?. my ex husband and i divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. it was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. i could have her every other weekend. our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. depression hit me hard and i became an alcoholic. i willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. from then on, i strived to improve my life. i did aa, went to rehab and i've been sober for a long time now. by the time my daughter was 9, i was completely sober. i looked forward to our visits. i was really heartbroken that i didn't get much time with her. 

he remarried and i was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. but over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. she called her mom( i don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). she completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. i could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. i was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.

at her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and i only got one picture with her. i was crushed. and when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. that broke my heart. she did not contact me much after that.

i moved to a different state after that. moved on with my life and i met an amazing man who is now my husband. we have a daughter together. i've completely moved on and i don't resent anyone. i have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. i'm content. i don't regret or resent anything. 

recently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. she's 28 now. according to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. she fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. she's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. she apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. according to her, her mother manipulated her. 

idk. i don't feel any connection between us now. honestly, i've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. i don't want to open that wound ever. i don't think it will do any good for my mental health and i'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. i don't think i can or should have her back in my life. here??

edit: i've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. but my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. he tried to help her out but she never improved. so he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. he adviced me not to take her in. he doesn't know that she's pregnant.

edit2: i'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. i'm not letting her stay with me for now. i have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. thanks for all the replies.

my date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. we tore up the floor all night long. any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. we were having a blast which was great because i really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). my dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

a few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and i should have toned it down. they have even gone so far as to tell me that i hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... i met him jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

so my question is, am i the asshole for dancing like i know how to dance or should i have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

edit: just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think i'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. 

i've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the posts, but since this is my first timing posting i'm not sure when to do that. thanks everyone, you all are right, i didn't think that i had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. it seems like popular vote is i made an ass of myself. i just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. you all gave me some stuff to think about. i had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too. i always thought that was just a bar rule.",3
"for asking my wedding guest to leave for wearing his military uniform at my wedding?. the son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. now, i have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. my wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.

up until the point that i asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which i don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. if he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  i felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!

i felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.

"if i ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?. alright, hear me out, because i know how this sounds. i (22m) have been best friends with ""john"" (22m) for about 6 years. we always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but i never really thought much of it. about 5 months ago, john came out to me and i was completely supportive, but to be honest i started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

for example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. i am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if i ever spend time with a girl over him. he always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that i do. it's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly i am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

i told him about a month ago that i would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. he was upset, and again it was about how i am trying to push him away. we haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that i addressed.

i feel like i can't put up with this anymore. i want it to be clear that i have **no issue** with him being gay, but i would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

"for refusing to lift something heavy for a woman as a man?. i was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while i was working at my desk, but when i got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. i was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while i was working just because i was the nearest available man, so i refused. the other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought i was joking, so i kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. i thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

am i the asshole?

edit: to clarify, the women in the break room weren't on official breaks. they just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. there are no official break times in my workplace. also, i was working on something at my desk when i was asked to lift said object.

edit 2: at the time of being asked, i was asked to help ""lift something"" in the break room. i assumed it was a package of mail or paper and i didn't know i'd be doing it myself, nor did i know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

edit 3: this was not the first time in the day i refilled the dispenser. i'm the closest man who sits near the break room, so i'm regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. however, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn't exactly petite either — none of them in the break room are. furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it's placed on the dispenser. i have also witnessed a 4'11"" woman change the bottle, so height isn't exactly much of an issue here.

edit 4: the woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. she is also married with children and i'm the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, i highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

edit 5: i never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume i did. i just refused to do the task for her.

edit 6: i am not the strongest person in the office — far from it. i don't lift weights and stay slim out of preference. we even have some female gym fanatics here. also, i barely know the woman who asked me. she's in another department in another part of the office.

update: i very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. she still defends chivalry, while i obviously find it illogical. our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. yes, everything i posted happened almost a decade ago. our discovery sparked a heated discussion and i wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others' viewpoints to close our debate. i put little effort in my original post without thinking i'd get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

i'm still employed with this company, and some involved have left. if there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. i'm glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. it's no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and i am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. our head of hr also announced in a staff meeting that we'll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they've even made positive changes at home as well — all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",3
"for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?. i was born on a res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. in my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. they make some truly remarkable stuff. caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. it's just how they do it. 

i have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. almost every day i wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who i am, where i'm from, etc. brings me a lot of joy.

anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. she compliments them and examines them. no issue there. lots of people do. one day recently though, she asked me where i got them and if the person has an ""etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. this woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

now... personally i have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! it's not about that. wear whatever you want. but the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). it's just not done. 

i told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. i told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. she kept pressing me, telling me ""well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

i got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. she got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to hr about me being racially discriminating.

aita? 

my reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. she is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",3
"for expecting my daughter to help her brother?. me (50sm)

my daughter (32/f)

my son (27/m)

i love my kids equally.  

my daughter lives at home rent free, which has allowed her to pursue her passion.  we don't charge her rent and so she's built up a good deal of savings (~50k).  

my son is a bit more aimless.  he has a college degree, but he and his girlfriend have chosen to pursue a more nomadic lifestyle.  he supports them (gf doesn't work) and does odd jobs/gigs.  they have lived in airbnbs for two years, until about a month ago.

last week, my son came to me to speak in private.  apparently, they have been living off of credit cards and now my son owes ~30k.  there's no way he'll be able to pay that off on his current job.  he has moved back in and is looking for more steady work, but it's going slowly as he has little career history to speak of.  meanwhile, the creditors are calling constantly.  the debt will inevitably grow with interest.  my wife is pushing hard for son to file for bankruptcy to manage this. 

i don't want my son to file for bankruptcy.  it would be a huge stain on his credit and make some jobs impossible to get.  i believe my daughter should loan him the money out of her savings.  when i pass all my children will have is each other.  they should learn how to rely on each other more.  

i told my daughter i think she should loan son the money.  she got extremely angry and left to live with her mom.  her mom, my wife, and my daughter are all angry at me now.

"for being too honest about having a baby?. so as i write this i'm feeding my 7 week old son. i am totally in love with him, he is amazing. however... the process of bringing him into the world was not good. at. all.

in order to explain why i might be an asshole i think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.

i had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that i weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before i conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). i could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and i got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.

then came labour and delivery. i was in labour for 92 hours. my son was back to back, so i was in agony. i had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. in the end his heart rate dropped and i had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.

i ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. my son was ill following delivery and ended up in the nicu for a few days. i had issues breastfeeding once he was out of nicu, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. i spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.

once home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.

he's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.




so why aita?

well, before i got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. which, pardon my french, is bollocks. i still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe i could mentally deal with another pregnancy.

part of the reason i think i have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues i had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. nobody told me that everything can go wrong. i didn't expect my birth plan to go as i hoped, but i thought i might get some things i wanted. i never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. i didn't prepare for him being ill. i didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.

so when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, i was totally honest.

i didn't sugar coat anything. i explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. i have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, i probably won't be doing it again.

well my friends have said that i'm an asshole for being so honest as i've put them off having children in the future. i didn't mean to scare them, but i felt that i would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.

i don't feel like i should apologise or say that i exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe i'm wrong.

"for getting defensive about a birthday gift i gave to a friend?. for a friend's birthday i got him a budget record player from amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. he is pretty into music so i thought it would be a cool gift. plus i'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.

after i gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. here enters pretentious music snob (pms), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.

pms: (asking me) how much did you get it for?

me: 60 dollars.

pms: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. it's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.

i thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but i gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.

my friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. 

pms: the speakers sound pretty crap.

friend: i think it sounds fine.

pms: you know what you can do? you should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. here's the setup i have at home. (pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) the one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.

at this point i was pretty annoyed. he might be right, but i think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when i was right next to him. so i decided to call him out.

me: hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)

the room became silent and it got pretty awkward. i know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling pms out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but i reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.

so aita?

edit: i posted this before going to bed (i live in australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but holy crap this blew up. here's some additional info:

when birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. so when pms was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. 

to be honest i'm not a confrontational person and i wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. i said what i said to a) shut him up, i wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes b) yes i said it in a way that embarrassed him. i'm not a saint, i didn't take the high road, but i sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. 

when i said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. i've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since pms was also annoying him. 

i posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that i didn't over escalate it. my conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and i don't regret what i did.",3
"for refusing to speak english to around my stepdad. i'm half japanese and my family recently moved into my stepdad's house.  i speak english with my brothers but japanese with my mom. at the dinner table, my stepdad will get angry if we speak japanese because he feels left out.  he frequently stands up and declares that he is left out and leaves the room to watch tv.

"for not letting a family member i barely know drive my expensive car in an ""emergency""?. i was at my in law's house yesterday, alone with their god daughter (we'll call her ashley, she's 28), while my husband was out doing stuff with his parents to discuss important family matters. i was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. i don't really have a great relationship with ashley, so i was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. about an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

my car is a new mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. i absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. i asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. so, i told her i would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

she starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister asap. i told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, i don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. she asked if i could drive her to get her and i told her i had too much wine to drive. she then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating i might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

when they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how i wouldn't let her take mine. she goes on about how my ""fancy car is more important than a child in crisis"". i told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. 

my in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. when my husband was driving us home he told me i made the right call because ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast. however, the next morning my in laws text me that ashley was incredibly upset and i should have just let her take my car. 

so, am i the asshole here? like i said, she told me the kid wasn't in any danger. i feel like i'm being shat on for having boundaries. am i off base?",3
"for contacting the mom of my daughter's (15f) boyfriend (15m) regarding some concerning behavior and messages?. so my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  i put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  my daughter and i have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  i am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

the problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  he calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  she has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  he has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  she recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

she sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  i was very proud of the way she handled it.  we have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  i think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  it was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  he then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  he then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  she.  is.  done.

as a mom, i would want to know if my son (13m) was treating someone like this.  i recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  we have chatted in the past, and i have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  or would i be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200b;

update:  i talked with my daughter tonight and told her that i was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (for the record, i would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  i respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  i explained that i don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and i am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  but i have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  i am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

she was not upset at all and said she understood why i would want to call his mom.  she asked that i wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  we agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by friday, i will make the call.  as a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  she is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200b;

also, for those of you who have asked... from a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  we never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  when problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  so her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  i'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",3
"for selling my son's home because they decided to be childfree?. i know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

i'm 47f, my husband is 49m, my son is 28m, his fiancee is 27f.

when my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. we wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. at least in our names, our family is protected. we think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

they've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this october. but we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. this is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. but it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

we would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. but instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. this is like the difference of a factor of two. we spent our money needlessly.

i'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. my husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. i don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but i think they knew they didn't want children. you don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

would i be the asshole for selling their home? we'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. they'd never be homeless.

**edit**

just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. the problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. children need extra space. now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. in our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. this is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. there's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",3
"for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?. just as a little background, i grew up in a very strict christian family where i wasn't allowed to cut my hair, ever, because ""hair is a woman's crown"". it was down to my knees by the time i escaped at 18. ever since then i've either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because i cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. so that's a big reason i'm so stubborn about this issue. also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. right now i'm bald because i always shave my head completely for the summer. 

one of my good friends is getting married in august and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. everything had been cool, she's always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if i could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. she explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. i told her i really didn't want to get a wig, and we've been on bad terms ever since.

all of our friends are on her side because ""it's just a wig"" and ""it's not like she's asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she's not the one being unreasonable."" and i know i can be very stubborn sometimes, which i guess is the reason i'm posting here. 

the thing is, i don't know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. i've already paid for a bridesmaid's dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who's going to do our makeup. this wedding has already cost me a fortune. i could afford a wig if i wanted to, but do i really want to spend the money on something i'll never wear again when i've already spent a ton? not really.

also, this is going to be on a plantation in louisiana. in august. i'm already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

my biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying i'm the asshole-is the principle of the thing. i feel like it implies i look bad because i don't have hair, which i personally don't think is true. is being bald so hideous i'll ruin her pictures? is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? and i think the ""i want us to match"" thing is stupid. we're already wearing matching dresses, why isn't that enough? i know it's ""her day"" and we're supposed to make her happy, but isn't there a line? 

i've offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she's not having it. i'm still in the bridal party and invited but i don't know for how much longer, honestly. for not wanting to wear a wig?

edit: just to add two things: 1. she's not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. along with the headscarf i'd also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of august so it'd still be really short though.",3
"for saying in class that i don't care that my bully classmate is dead?. i (17m) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call jake (17m). jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. i hated him so much, i'd hate going to school and him being in class. i dreaded it.

well we found out that jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. when i saw this on facebook, i saw lots of rip posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. i felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

when i came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50f) said we need to take a moment silence for him. after the silence was done, i just said out loud ''i don't care that jake died. he was a bully''. people looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, i could hear some people muttering swear words.

but then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated jake too. honestly i'm fucking glad he's dead. i feel so much better about my life now. some classmates called me ah, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, ah was one of them. i just said to her ''you need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. 

i honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. aita?

**edit - the reason i say 'now ex lol' is because she chose to be in a relationship with an awful, awful person. that's bad character judgement on her part, and also complacency.**

**edit 2 - way too many comments to read....gonna sign off for a bit and read them later. i have had many helpful pm's. thank you to those who reached out.**",3
"for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?. i want to preface this by saying that i've been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day i graduated college. i know they don't owe me a dime and i'm grateful for everything they've given me in life. 

i have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. my sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and i'm happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. now it's my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. 

my sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. she didn't have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. my sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they're great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. 

i know i sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. there was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. i knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn't want to have an infant at that age. in my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. i don't blame her for being scared. i would have been terrified to. 

but i'm still upset that now i won't be able to have much of a wedding because i had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. i'm not so much upset that they gave it to her, but i am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. that they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. my sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. 

when my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. i couldn't hide my disappointment. i really tried to reassure them that i understood, but they could tell i was hurt. my sister called later and told me that it sucks i can't have a 'fancy wedding' (like hers) but basically i need to grow up. which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. she said she's sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as i'd hoped. 

i know this isn't the end of the world. this is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and i feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. i'm still getting married. my wedding won't compare to my sister's, but i'm still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. 

thanks for sticking with me through the story. i know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. so, am i overreacting? aita?

"for telling my boyfriend i don't want a penis?. this whole argument is really weird to me. basically, i'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, ""i bet you wish you had a dick."" to which i responded, ""no, not really."" 

he seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why i did not want to have a dick and i basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like i don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. hard pass. he got weirdly offended by this and said i was being sexist??? i told him that i observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if i had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. he got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me ""think about"" why what i said was so upsetting. 

i don't get it though? not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? y'all help me out lmao

edit: it's funny y'all keep mentioning freud. my boyfriend is studying psychology and actually obsessed with jung. like y'all know that post about that guy who was obsessed with jordan peterson to the point his girlfriend left him? he's that level obsessed with jung. 🧐",3
"for not allowing meat to be served at my wedding?. i'm a gen 1.5 indian migrant to the uk (was born in india but moved when i was 6 with parents) so while i grew up british and consider myself to be british, i still have family in india and my indian heritage is an important part of my identity. my wife is 4th gen indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. i'd like to stress there's nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?

due to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in england for all her family and our friends, and one in india for the rest of my family and friends there. we had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. it was great, and we had fun. now the wedding in india - it's important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the uk so i'd love for them to see me get married. 

the problem comes with the menu - in a hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don't serve meat. you just don't. in fact, what's served at a wedding is something called a sadya(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadhya). it's fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. my wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family 'won't be able to cope' without meat. i'm of the opinion that they're all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it's that bad run to a kfc after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. it's also not like there won't be any meat - there'll be non veg food at the sangeet, there'll be meat at the reception. 

also during the english wedding i sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being hindus don't partake, but i told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

so, for not wanting meat at the wedding?",3
"for asking my coworker why he's married?. (throwaway with names changed because i know a few of my coworkers use reddit.)

so there's this guy at my work, james, who makes derogatory jokes about his wife. any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.  he'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.
  
and when i say constantly, i mean constantly.  in the three years i've worked with james, i've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those lines maybe three or four times.  it really gets on my nerves to hear him trash talk her all the time.  

today another coworker of ours said that he was making plans for his anniversary with his wife, and james butted in and said ""oh, yeah, mine's coming up soon, too.  i guess i need to do something or i'll never hear the end of it.""

and i kind of lost my temper and asked him ""if that's the way you feel why are you still married to her?!"" 

james kind of sputtered a bit that he was joking, and i told him that he always talks about being married like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.

it kind of went to an awkward silence until james left for the day.  some of my coworkers are glad i called him out on it, some of them think what i said went too far.

so here?  should i apologize to james tomorrow?",3
"if i reported this woman?. i was on a call with my sister, who was giving me some usual gossip about people we know from back home, when she tells me about a family friend dina who has just recently become sexually active with her boyfriend. i asked my sister how she knew dina was sexually active, and she told me she heard it from my mom. 

i know that dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. i asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her miss annie (not dina's mother) is very good friends with dina's pcp, who told her the gossip. i work in healthcare, and i feel like this has to be a hipaa violation, so i told my sister i might have to report dina's pcp. 

if i report her? my sister told me i shouldn't because ""you'll be ruining that doctor's life and her family over 'just a bit of gossip'"" (she has two small children and is in the process of moving her husband over to the us from abroad) and that i should just ""mind my own business."" my best friend (who also knows dina well) said that i don't have any proof to report her over just ""hearsay"" and ""gossip."" however this situation isn't sitting right with me.

edit: hey guys! so after heavy consideration, i scheduled a three way call between my sister, dina and i to talk about this. i'll keep you all updated! thanks for all your input everyone :)

edit 2: hi guys! sorry for the lack of update (mods turned me down) just wanted to update you all - turns out that dina did tell her doctor about it.... in confidence at a family friend's party where miss annie happened to be eavesdropping on. long story short, dina's mom had an angry conversation with miss annie and told her essentially to ""get a life"" and to ""stop gossiping about other people's children."" i'm happy i told dina first and didn't report that doctor. thanks guys!",3
"possibly over-reacting at my wife's ""mistake"" by leaving the house for a week. i know relationship posts aren't allowed here so i want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. so please don't give any relationship advice.

okay, so i am a big fan of seinfeld as i used to watch it every day after school with my dad. i had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters jerry, kramer, costanza, and elaine. this poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times i got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. so yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

now my wife and i have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. as you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and i guess you can see where this is going. i hadn't been in my study a few weeks as i've been on an extended business trip, and when i come home to my study my poster is gone. i ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on ebay.

here's where it gets iffy. she claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, despite it being so sentimental to me. the reason i am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. she tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure i behave myself). however i couldn't say no, i literally had to go or i'd severely hurt my reputation at work. so when i leave we're fighting, when i come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" see where i'm coming from?

i told my wife i was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when i get back. she's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

"for pressing charges on my daughter for fraud?. me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though i consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. for some basic context, she took out a parent plus loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. in her first semester of her freshman year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. we explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. after me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. we brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

come us, a couple years down the road. we've gotten a letter from the department of education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. we reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. she filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct social security numbers and all. we've spoken with the school and the doe a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. we can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in medical debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. at this point, i'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. we don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. so, here's the important question, reddit: if i press charges here, aita?

edit: since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. a plus loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the repayment process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


edit 2: i promised myself i would never do anything stupid like this if i ever had a post blow up, but now i truly understand what rip inbox means. i really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; i know reddit is one of the few places i can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


in reality, even though i've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying i wnbta (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, i'm still 100% split about how i actually want to go. you guys have given me a lot to chew on, and i'd really like to thank you all.",3
"for grounding my son for the rest of the year and forbidding him from seeing his girlfriend (or any of his friends) privately because i found out he wasn't using condoms?. two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and i freaked out. he said he's scared for his life and he doesn't know what he's going to do. we had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. he said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn't know what he's going to do because he's not ready to be a father. his girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there's not anything he can do.

i asked him how could this happen; why wasn't she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and especially, why isn't he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. he said that his girlfriend's parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and i quote ""condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag."" apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because ""together, it's almost impossible to get pregnant.""

i was **infuriated**. i've talked to him all the time about safe sex. we're no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he'd start having sex. which is why we emphasized being *safe*. we've just have had this conversation so many times; i was just so. angry. that my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

i told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he's effectively grounded until the end of the year. he can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. he can also only do this only when we're home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). that means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. if he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we'll use find my iphone to track him. he said he understood.

he came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. he asked now that she's not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and i want to stick to our guns on this. though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. but he's shown us he's downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

my son maintains that we're being way to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he's also said in the past that he'd never have sex without a condom because ""he's not an idiot."" we just plainly cannot trust him right now. are we being unreasonable?

edit: the work thing would've just been for the summer. sorry for the confusion; we agree that there's no way on earth he could manage that many hours during the school year.",3
"got a tarantula so the in-laws stop coming by. i have insufferable in laws. father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.

my wife is chinese and her parents are really traditional. privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries. they will come around every day unannounced to visit my wife/play with our kids. so not only do i never get a break from my mother in laws constant nagging, i have no privacy from them.

wife has ignored my concerns for years. to be fair, she's in a tough spot as standing up to chinese parents is a pain i guess.

anyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. a few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. panic attack and all.

so i got the idea to get a tarantula as a way to prevent her coming so often. it's in a big enclosure in the living room. asked wife before hand if it's okay, but didn't tell her the motivation. worked like a charm, the dad still comes but the mother can't stand to be in the same house as it.

"for 'forcing' my son to be a father after he got a girl pregnant?. my son is 21 years old and got a girl from work pregnant. needless to say, i am incredibly disappointed in him and when he told me i was devastated he'd make such a silly mistake. i asked him about an abortion and he broke down and told me he'd worn a condom and he was hoping she'd abort but to no avail. 

i have met the future mother of my grandchild in a very awkward meeting one day and it's clear to me she's a lovely young lady. however i found out from her (not even my coward son) that he has broken all ties with her and plans only to give child support and not see this baby at all. 

i have been texting her and trying to assuage her worries but she is also understandably worried that she won't have any support and that her baby- my first grandchild- won't have its father. obviously i am very much wanting to be in this child's life also.

of course i have been trying to speak to my son over and over about this issue and i keep telling him that the deed is done and he needs to just deal with it now. he told me in tears that he never wanted to be a father and he wore protection, as well as the fact they were casual lovers and nothing more. i told him i would withdraw all financial assistance if he wasn't in this babies life and he told me if that was the case then so be it, so i took his car and phone and bank cards that were attached to my account. 

in response to this, he's moved in with his father but i have no idea where he lives and he's not even attempted once to contact me. he told me he was leaving and that i wasn't supporting him. my own parents are vehemently against him leaving and have said they'll disown him if he doesn't come back.

"for not fessing up to causing a coworkers allergic reaction?. last week one of my coworkers started to feel unwell and another coworker took her to the er. she was having an allergic reaction. she has an allergy towards peanuts and thinking back on it i probably caused the reaction since we both had had to use the same computer to check order and i had peanut butter on my waffles that morning. i definitely don't think i washed my hands after either. once somebody got the call she was ok they asked us all in a group who had had peanut butter that day and i stayed completely silent.

well, yesterday she came back into work. she was fine and everything, but apparently the trip to the er still cost her $300 after insurance plus the money she lost not going to work for a two days. our coworkers all sympathized and a few started saying whoever had the peanut butter should have to pay. since i wasn't part of that conversation. i just heard them from across the room, i just focused on my work an tried to avoid the subject for the rest of the day.

"for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?. hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, i'm not one to really do this but i'm genuinely wondering if i'm in the wrong.


so my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. for context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


i don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables i normally cook - pretty much all i ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. we said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. we told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


well, that night was meatloaf night. with homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. i offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. so, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were pissed. they said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? even though it was his choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think i should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. i also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some i'm not going to say no. so what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",3
"for not taking pictures of my wife at our wedding?. so we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'i do', 'sarah' and i would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. it was her idea and i thought it would be fun. 

fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. we look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

her photos: me in my suit, me with our god daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. more of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

my photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

as soon as sarah saw the pictures i had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. i asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that i hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. i basically told her that i didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. she replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. this conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. i feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, i need to know if i'm in the wrong.

so, am i the asshole here? i... feel like she's overreacting a little. i thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. i didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**edit: info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. the cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. i remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. she prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**edit 2** i'm the asshole. and a clueless idiot. from now on i'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. thank you to all who have judged me, i accept my judgement",3
"for saying no when a child i didn't know asked if she could play with my sons bike.. this is literally the hot topic of the day for my entire family and i'm fed up of being called an asshole so i'm going to ask on here. 

we are on a family vacation at the moment and we had gone to a park where there were a lot of young families like my own. my 4 year old son has a new bike that he loves to ride around on and there was another family close by us that had also settled for a picnic like we had on the grass. they were pretty close by. 

my son is obsessed with his bike and loves it. he had been playing on it for a while, and the other family had a little girl his age that kept looking over. 

when we sat down to eat my son sat with me, the little girl came over and shyly asked my mom if she could play with the bike. my mom always says yes to everything, and she has this really blase attitude towards belongings and she's lost some of my sons stuff before that way because she just isn't attached to material things.

i interrupted before my mom could speak and really gently told the little girl 'why don't you ask (my son) since it's his bike?' she did and my son said no. she looked a little crestfallen but went back to her family and she didn't seem bothered afterwards. 

my entire family looked at my like i was an evil witch and even my own husbands facial expression was surprised at me. 

i got a little defensive and told them that it was our sons toy to lend out as he pleased, and i was a little irritated to hear my mom say to my son 'honey, sometimes it's nice to share' because he looked upset afterwards. l know that, he knows that, but it's his new toy and he shouldn't be made to feel bad over not wanting to share with a total stranger.

"for stealing my friends bird. i love birds, and i'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. i've had them for about a year and a half. when i first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

she then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. she got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

every time i went over to her house, i told her that it needed more attention. it just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. its food and water were probably only changed once a week. it was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

i told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. and despite promising to do better, she never did. 

i asked her if i could have it. she got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

i felt really horrible every time i went over there. i decided i wanted to steal it. i felt like i could give it a better life. it could even make friends with my 2 birds. i just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

so i did it. she was in the bathroom, and i took a shoe box i had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. it was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. i left without even saying goodbye. 

soon after i got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. i said that i'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. she once again used the argument of, ""its my bird, i can do what i want with it.""

i took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. it began chirping for the first time i had ever heard. it seemed very happy. 

this was all 3 days ago. my friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying i'm being an asshole. so reddit, aita?

update: wow, i was not expecting this to get so huge. 

i honestly went into this thinking i was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. she didn't. like i said, i would have given it back if she had. 

i guess i just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. which now, after reading the comments, i understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

today i offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. she took it and is letting me keep the bird. but she still hates me. honestly, at this point, i couldn't care less. the bird is safe. that's all that matters.

i think i could've handled it better, but i don't regret my choices. thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",3
"for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?. i have a friend, bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. he's quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he's a solid guy and he's good to spend time with. we met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. first year we lived together, and have stayed friends since i moved out. after the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. he's not completely without his sight so it's not like we didn't notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it's just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he's not allowed to drive or get his license. he's completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can't drive. he's always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he'd travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


now my fiance and i have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. as is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and bobby received both. because i'm not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. we had a few people who missed the rsvp date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. the rsvp date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. 


background backgrounded. now for the potential assholery.


bobby also missed the rsvp date. he wasn't the only one i had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he's messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. the reason for his plus one is his eyesight. because he doesn't drive and he's not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. i flat out told him no, he's not inviting his mum as a plus one because we've already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she's welcome at the rest of the day. 
the hotel in reality doesn't need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there's no easy space to slot her in, and i don't want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. i now doubt whether he'll come, because i don't know if she's happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


am i the asshole?




*edit:* a few things to update here. i've been chatting to the friend more. despite what you all think, i do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can't be put across in a post. the mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. and by the tone of bobbys message, it wasn't bobby asking for his mum to be there, but bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. ceremony and evening do is fine, and i told bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. i've since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that's on site.

additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. it's either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can't/won't drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. the bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. it's only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

to those saying he needs eyes for the evening. i'm not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if i am still an asshole. i'm saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn't need his mother there. there are plenty of college friends there, who he's seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. it's a group of friends and we've all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as i said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

i can live with being judged an asshole, but felt there was more information available that was affecting my decision, that wasn't available to the jury.",3
"update aita, i flew 1k miles to visit a girl, arrived here and saw another guy has also come to see her but i don't want her to spend any time with him. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cn59tp/aita_i_flew_1k_miles_to_visit_a_girl_arrived_here/?st=jzismolp&sh=acd7fa42

i got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. the rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. so essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (i slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but i mean going out alone without third wheel).

i decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and i confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. i guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me i should probably talk to him because i felt she was lying. so i went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as i was. except she lied and said i purposely told her i couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". this isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and i never insinuated i wouldn't get a hotel room. she told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. they had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. a lot more than she did with me. i felt heartbroken, still do but i'm feeling better. on this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. he does really like her, i'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, she never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, i told him he could have her.

so yeah. in essence, she lied a lot. she told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. she told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. she told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while i was also there. it's shit.

shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. turns out i am really fucking stupid however i'm working on it and you can bet i won't make the same mistake again.

thank you to everyone who commented and helped me decide what to do",3
"for calling the police on my kid?. daughter is 16. her mom and i are divorced.daughter has been caught smoking pot several times from the age of 14. her mom and i have collectively punished her several times for this. the last time we caught her, i started drug testing her. her mom doesn't agree with it, but we have caught her so many times now that i think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.

i don't normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and i needed to reset it. when i go into her room, i found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. i look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. i go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously i am enraged, so i wait for her to get back from school, and i called the police. she was arrested, booked and released into her mother's custody.

her mother is pissed, and saying that i may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. she now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn't take the rules in my house seriously. i doubt she'll get more than probation anyway.

my parents are also pissed though, saying that this could have been handled inside the home, and that's why i'm here. i'm wondering if i over reacted and would like a more impartial judgment.

&#x200b;

i am making and edit to respond to a few things.

this was a small ten gallon tank. i guess people are picturing something larger. there were a lot of mushrooms in there though. my daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that i don't bother to look in there too much. because she has been passing her drug tests, i have been cutting her slack. i honestly would not have called the police if i thought that she was going to get a jail sentence at all.",3
"for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?. this actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and i honestly don't think i'm in the wrong, i figured i'd ask for an outside opinion.

my girlfriend (then fiancee) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that i've never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. she left me with my grandma and i was raised by her since birth. i have always and will always consider my grandma my real ""mother""  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

about a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. this was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn't have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer's help. she had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma's condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. my uncles and i immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

she doesn't pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. i called my fiancee multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. not only was i not in the best state of mind (again, she's my mother to me) but i needed to be by her side when she passed. i felt sick at the idea of not being there when i could.

my fiancee was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted i get ready as soon as possible. she obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and i understand that it definitely sucks. she also said there was no point in me being there since she won't even know i'm there due to her dementia. i understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn't matter if she realised i was there or not. i just felt i had to be there with my uncles. 

she ended up passing the night of my wedding. my fiancee didn't talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. she said i was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. she thinks that as my fiancee she should take top priority no matter what. my opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

so yeah that's the back story. we have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my gf.",3
"for exposing my late wife to my sons?. please bear with me while i try to gather my thoughts and explain just what's going on. i (m40)was married to my wife (f38) for 18 years. we had what i thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great, and she was my best friend. we had two sons together, j who is 14 and m who is 16. 

my wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. i feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

here is the hard part. two nights ago i decided to go through my wife's cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken i never got sent. that's when i found the messages after i decided to look through her browser history. 

messages to men in their 60's sending dirty photos she had sent me. nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. i don't want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but i cannot believe she could have done this to me. i suspected nothing. ever. 

my sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. how much they miss her love and honesty. i cannot see her as the woman i thought i knew and i am torn on what to do. on one hand, i don't want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand i feel they are old enough to know the truth. 

if i exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing to our family? please help me.


edit: wow. thanks for all the feedback. i never knew that me losing a best friend, wife and mother of my children would end with me being berated. this post didn't come from malicious intent to hurt my children, and i apologize if it came out that way. i asked because i truly don't know. i feel that i would have wanted to know who my mother was fully but i can see why so many disagree. 
this is something that i will keep to myself for now- and if my children ever inquire further that's something i will deal with along the way. 

to all the ones who were kind, thank you. and to those calling me a selfish piece of shit i hope you are never put in my position. thank you.

last edit: it's now been about 24 hours since my post- which i never thought would get front page- and i want to thank everyone who has reached out to me. i understand that 'exposing' was a very poor word choice and came across the wrong way. i'm still trying to message everyone back who has privately reached out. 
as i said earlier, this will be something i keep to myself and have a talk about truth with my sons down the road. i'm meeting with her family today to figure out what to do about her things and what else. i'm also looking into therapists for my sons today like many of you have mentioned.",3
"for never telling my son about the existance of his twin brother. my 4 year old son jon is the one of the twins i had. my other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. 


me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


while growing up, despite never being mentioned, jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. he told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell jon about it when he is older. it must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


i am still still standing firm to our promise. i believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, i would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. i want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. they want so much to included a deceased brother into jon's life. he is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and i cannot stop them. however, i will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.


for thinking this way?


edit: firstly i am sorry, but for anonymity purposes i omitted and changed some parts of the contents, so not all of it is real. secondly thank you for the comments, took me a while to read it all. 

i am at peace now, and i will make it up to jon.",3

"for telling my sister a ""wedding tattoo"" is a curse (even though i have one), and now the curse is coming true?. my partner and i are in our 30s and we live in a country where gay marriage is illegal. we got engaged years ago knowing we wouldn't be able to marry, but we set a ""wedding"" date and had a party for friends and family. instead of an actual ceremony, we got matching tattoos. we had been together 7 years when that happened, and it's been another 6 years since then.

anyway, my sister has been with her husband for just under 2 years. they got engaged almost as soon as they started dating, and they married 3 months ago. however, they're both not into wearing rings, so my sister suggested to her husband to get tattoos instead.

i jokingly told her that it's a curse (that getting a tattoo of a boyfriend/husband/partner's name will result in a break-up) and she said that my relationship is still going strong despite the curse. i said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. i told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. they don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. she thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. i've never heard of something like this before. i very much doubt i have this superpower of destroying relationships. but my sister is currently going around telling our relatives i'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

"for reporting a theft a young man committed, he lost his scholarship and admission to university. i own a liquor store in the suburbs. overall the area is decently safe, especially compared to the city.

two weeks ago, a young man and one of his friends came into the store and ran off with bottles of liquor. we reported them to law enforcement with the license plates. officers tracked them and asked if we want to pursue charges. 

two days later one of the kids mothers comes by and begs me to drop the charges. she says her son is the first one in the family to go to college and that he has a scholarship and that if the university finds out they will rescind their offer, and the scholarship.

i told her i am sorry but i already have made up my mind. since then people in the community have treated me much worse i believe she probably told a lot of people i don't know her version of events. 

but now i am a being seen as a horrible person. and that i am directly responsible for what the university chooses to do. and people are saying that if a white kid robbed me that i wouldn't have went to the police. and this is not true, i am an equal opportunity reporter

i don't know what's going on to be honest, it also appears that he had a previous criminal record as well.

"for excluding one of my girlfriends from girls' night out after he came out as transgender?.   first off it's not my intent to misgender but this is new to me so excuse me. one of my friends recently came out as trans and said she always felt like a guy trapped inside a woman's body.



  she has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. i have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and i don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   we don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. i mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and i think our feelings overtake his. plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. i don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings. aita?",3
"for divorcing husband over his past sperm donation. 1. married for 8 years, have one child (3f) together

4. actually ask him last week and he tells me the fertility centres last updated him at 47 kids

i was... not expecting that many. 

it's clearly my fault for not asking how many. at the time, i literally said i ""didn't care"" about his sperm donation and ""didn't want to know"", so i can't blame him for not telling me how many. i literally told him not to.
