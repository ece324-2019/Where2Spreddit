edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",9

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

as far as linkedin go, it's a less-detailed version of the master document i keep, as far as work experience goes, but i go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on linkedin than i do on paper.

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",9

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",9

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",9

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",9

"lpt tips: what you should never to bring to a dry cleaners. i owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. i know the whole process. i'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

edit: disclaimer: my experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of all dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

down jackets -  down items are expensive. it could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. down items are not pressed. you could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

comforters - never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. if your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. you're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

spot-clean only dresses - many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  it might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. they may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

wedding dresses - wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, never opt for the preservation box. dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners do not press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. by the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  so you're paying more money for the dress without the pressing. you get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

leather: leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. so you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. also, there is no special leather dry cleaning method. leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. you're essentially just paying for the labor charge. to save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&#x200b;

worth it:

men's button-up shirts - men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, they're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

wool peacoats - wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

d/c only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.

oil/grease spill - dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. if you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. it's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. they are laundered. however they do look nice when pressed. so you could save money by washing items like jerseys and polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

bottom-line: to get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  if your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.",9
"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",9

use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

people often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. however the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

it is way easier to see with an image(http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). if you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

so i started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. it totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person i was talking to more receptive to my instructions. instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college.. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying. 

***use rainymood(https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** i'm sure many of you know about it but i love this one.

"if you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. it is a federally protected right to speak about salary.. in the usa, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- agricultural laborers   
- airline employees   
- supervisors (who aren't classed as ""employees"" for this purpose)  
- independent contractors 

while it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in human resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

got one last year, was surprised at how cheap and effective it is.

our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut. we used this and found very slight cracks in the chaulking that were letting cold air in. after using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

double bonus: aim it at your so and say you found something hot.

you can get them on amazon shipped right to you and the batteries last forever, enjoy!

"if you're buying a home printer for occasional use, get a laser printer; they're more expensive up front but way more economical in the long run.. edit: wow! front page! i'm on cloud 9 right now. 

to answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven. 

as for photos, many people have pointed this out and it's a valid concern. many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. you still have options.

"bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike. **tl;dr: short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

the recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

she survived, but she easily could have died. *on a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

i myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. the only time i've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. i got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. it really can happen to just about anyone. i got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

and now, with the popularity of parks exploding, i see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. if anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

so: never go unprepared. get a wide-mouth nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

the things i have in mine include:

\- survival heating blanket

\- plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- whistle

\- flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- critical meds and bandages

\- zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- compass (if you're able to use it)

\- paracord

\- knife

\- duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (i always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing i can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - i've experienced this first-hand).

\- iodine tabs for water

\- beef jerky

\- energy gel

**edit:** because it may be of interest: i just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that i don't mention in the list. for reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**edit 2:** i wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. the kit i describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

the kit i mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

for people wanting to see the kit i made, or skeptical it can be done - just google nalgene survival kit. lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than i have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *this kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",9

>furthermore, document the encounter to the best of your ability. this is not the time you want to shoo someone away immiediately. be comfortable being uncomfortable and without escalating the situation, ask as many questions as you can. who are you with (even if they lie, they likely have told that lie before), contact numbers, etc. did they come in a vehicle? take the plates down, make, model, any damage to the vehicle. which direction did they go in, did they talk to any neighbors.
